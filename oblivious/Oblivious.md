# BOOK ONE
## Chapter One
*Just book the fucking ticket.*
*The rest should take care of itself.*
---
My moment came when I was taking an ultra-extended, double-lunch-break from my job.
No one will notice I'm gone. If they do they'll think I'm at a meeting...
I’m out of the skyprison and walking through the Supreme Court Gardens. I never come here; it’s too far away from work. My feet have aimlessly dragged me out here anyway - with eyes glazed over. In fact, I’m not even sure that these *are* the Supreme Court gardens...
Anyway. It’s a glorious day; there’s just the right amount of fluffy cloud in the sky, the grass is green, so too are the trees. The lake is blue. There are ducks. It’s all quite picturesque.
There is, however, a thorn sitting in amongst the roses, standing out like dogs balls, crapping on my oil painting.
*A scruffy looking homeless lad on a park bench.*
He’s just chillin', taking the air.
He’s got a big, fat backpack sitting beside him that looks like it’s had a hard life and is well and truly on the way out.
He’s too *ragged* to be a traveller, but not quite *clapped-out* enough to be homeless...
He’s an odd *goldilocks* between backpacking and hobo; like an intrepid destitute.
Which is he? I can’t cog it...
And it bugs me. *I need to know.*
I want to go and ask him, but I figure that in either case it’d be a little offensive.
Plus, he seems to be quietly at peace, and I don’t want to kill his vibe...
Then it hits me - right between the eyes - and makes my face scrunch up.
Not the smell...
*A thought...*
Again, I can’t cog it... Here’s me, in my ironed shirt and fancy pants and shiny shoes, and over there is Marco Polo's arsehole. *And he’s having a better day than I am.*
*I’m bloody sure of it.*
Just *look at him*... He's got two fifths of sweet-fuck-all, and I’m deadset certain that he’s enjoying himself, out here, in the sunshine, on his park bench, contemplating various duck oddities, more than I am, crunching numbers back at 'The Bad Place'...
Then it hits me again, like a fucking freight train: *I’d swap places with the guy.*
I’d do it.
*I’d do it right now;* He can go back to 'The Dream Job', and I’ll hang out here and watch the ducks...
---
I pass the second half of the double-lunch-break on the park bench over from *Marco*. I've been trying to do what he does... Pretty simple.
My hobo-cum-traveller decides to lie down and take an afternoon kip...
So yeah, *he’s probably a hobo...* And I’m not sure I can take the copycat routine that far...
But it doesn’t matter. The damage is done. *The seed is planted.*
I walk back to the chain-gang with a sense of purpose, and do something entirely irrational.
Ticket: *booked*.
Booked for an insane length of time into the future, but it's booked. *Done.*
---
*Blink.*
The 'insane length of time into the future' is *now*.
*It went that fast.*
I blinked, I nearly missed it...
I've taken enough *jenga* pieces out of the tower of my life to bring the whole fucking thing crashing down. *A messy pile.*
But now I can start a new game...
In the blink of an eye the girlfriend got dumped, the job got quit, the rent got canned, the car got cubed, freshly obsolete stuff got sold in a fire-sale, mildly sentimental stuff got dumped at my parent's place, a bag was packed, the bank was informed, drinks were drunk and *that was it.*
---
Waiting in line to board the plane, the mad head-rush of excitement from the last few days washes off, and all that's left is the thought of how *easy* that was.
Seriously, a cakewalk. It all just *dissolved*.
Dissolved...
*Fuck...*
I’ve just dissolved my life...
Shit...
*Shit!*
This is a mistake.
*Fuck.* This is a *massive* mistake!
*What am I doing??!*
As I completely shit my pants, the lovely air hostess with the big smile and overly red lipstick takes my ticket and welcomes me aboard.
I must look like I'm fucking *insane...*
But it’s all too late to undo...
Even after the duck pondering it was already too late; there was no going back.
The whole thing has dragged me along by my bootstraps to *seat 33A.*
Buckle your seatbelts...
*We’re fucking off.*

## Chapter Two
*London.*
I’m always surprised when I land at a new place to find that *nothing’s different.* Always a little disappointed... I don't know what I was expecting. Some sort of metamorphosis? Nope.
*I'm still me.*
*It's still 'now'.*
Doesn't matter where I am or where I go, that never seems to change...
I unpack my stuff to see what I've remembered...
*Not socks*, apparently.
Only got two pairs.
*Amateur hour*.
Importantly, I packed my helmet. It's probably the only thing I couldn't forget...
---
I buy socks. And a motorbike.
A fucking *gorgeous* Royal Enfield.
My dream bike.
Picture something out of World War II. Something Steve McQueen would ride...
They used to make them in England, but they went broke, so now they're making them in India, of all places...
Practical? *Fuck no...*
That's not the point...
Everyone thinks I've gone mad: I have a perfectly good touring bike back home in the shed (a BMW 'adventure' bike, 'the right machine for the job') and yet, here I am, shelling out for perhaps the most impractical bike that I could possibly buy.
Do I give a single fuck?
*Nope.*
Not one.
The Enfield floats my boat. *Bigtime.* Everyone can go get fucked.
I feel like I've won on the haggle too. Not much of an arm wrestle, really... *Anything* I asked for got thrown in to the deal: A set of crashbars, change the speedo to kilometres per hour (none of this imperial shit), first service for free, a copy of the Royal Enfield workshop manual, a back seat plus 'saddle bags', and a waterproof cover to put over the whole bike.
*And* a badass new leather jacket...
I ride out of the dealership like I stole the thing.
*You couldn’t slap this grin off my face.*
I’m *brutally* happy.
Happy as a pig in shit.
This was a great choice...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_1.jpg)
---
*Disaster.*
We *lurch*.
The Enfield's powering down like someone turned the key off...
I wring the throttle on and off. *Nothing...* It keeps winding down...
*It's only been a few hundred clicks.* Day one's not even in the books yet!!
The red 'engine warning light' has flashed onto the speedo...
We decelerate slower and slower...
What the fuck's going on here? This is a new bike!!
*"Piece of shit!!"*
The Enfield roars back into life again, full power, accelerating.
*"What the fuck was that??"*
The Enfield just carries on like nothing happened...
*Jesus.*
I've made a big mistake. An *expensive* mistake...
*Fuck.* Why didn't I just buy something German, or Japanese?
Fucking idiot...
I pull over and call the dealer for a 'please explain'.
They say it's likely an electrical fault...
They assure me that if there's oil in the sump I can't break anything important... They'll fix the fault at the free service that I wrangled, due in five hundred clicks.
---
They look surprised to see me...
The fuck-up was yesterday. I've already chalked up the distance.
I think I've broken a record...
We do the service, which is fairly straightforward.
I made it a condition of the purchase that I get to do the service *myself.*
They thought it was an odd request, but I *need* to learn stuff. I've even read 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', which was neither about *Zen* nor *motorcycle maintenance...*
*False advertising.*
Anyway. The *service* part is basically just a changing of the oil and filters and stuff. Pretty straight forward, with supervision...
Disturbingly, the oil and the filters are full of chunky bits of metal... Apparently that's 'normal'...
Once the 'first service' stuff is out of the way, it's time to get down to fixing that 'fault'.
My mate Kev the mechanic reckons it's a clogged 'injector', which, he explains, is the thing that sprays fuel into the cylinder.
We get to work.
*The injector's a bitch to get at.* The whole fuel tank has to come off, and then it's *fiddle city,* with cables and hoses and wires all in the way of prying fingers.
Once all that's out of the way, the injector unscrews out and the new one goes in, and it all has to be put back together the way it came apart...
Takes an age...
I'm in the final stages of the job. I've been attacking an *infuriatingly* tricky electrical plug for the last five minutes, when I see that another plug's been unclipped... *I don't remember doing that...*
"Hey Kev?"
"Yeah"
"Come have a look at this... Nah, in deeper... Can you see that plug? Did you unclip that?"
"Ah, no... Not that one" Kev scratches his head.
"Me neither." We spend a moment in silence...
*Click*
Kev and I share a look. "Enfields are quirky..."
"You're not wrong, Kev."
I put it all back together, I shake hands with Kev and the boys, and peel out.
At the first crossroads I pull a small compass out of my pocket. It points north. *Sounds good to me...*

## Chapter Three
*It's so stupidly easy.*
Gloriously simple.
I take a look at the map in the morning over breakfast, find a direction that looks interesting, set a bearing, and go.
When I've got an option of different roads to take, I consult the compass while still rolling, and go with the option that best lines up with my bearing, no matter what the road looks like.
*It's never failed me.*
With no planned routes, I spend all of my time on wonderful one-and-a-half lane country roads, getting thoroughly, wonderfully lost in the British countryside.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_2.jpg)
Yet, at the end of every day, I always find myself within spitting distance of where I wanted to be.
Half the time I land on it like a fucking homing pigeon.
And if it doesn't work out, who cares? There's always, *always* somewhere to stay at the end of a long day in the saddle; hostels, hotels, b&b's, camping, whatever; It's so bloody easy.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_3.jpg)
*I love it to bits.*
Britain is *wonderful.*
I knock off three thousand clicks in twelve days. 
The lads at the dealership are definitely surprised to see me this time. If I didn't set a record for the first service, I definitely got it on the second.
I paid for it too; my back is killing me and my arse is numb. Not that I care.
In three thousand clicks there are fresh problems to solve on the Enfield. Easy ones, this time; the number plate fell off, the neutral light on the speedo stopped working, and the head gasket had started pissing oil...
Easy fixes.
Throw in a standard service and we're free to go again.
Set compass: North.
*Again.*

## Chapter Four
![](/oblivious/images/Image_4.jpg)
I gone done a whole bloody lap of England and Scotland.
It's been *nothing* like I expected. Outside of the big city centres, it's all so *green*, so *rural.*
When the sun's out and shining you'd be hard-pressed to top the United Kingdom for a ride...
I love pies and warm beer and shitty fish and chips.
I've been utterly surprised and delighted with all of it.
I never want to leave...
And I wouldn't.
*Except I have to...*
*Winter is coming.* Hard.
I've been copping it. Being on a bike in the drizzling rain is the pits. Fucking miserable.
Discomfort aside, I even managed to crash the bike while being a silly dickhead in the Scottish Highlands. Thoroughly scared the shit out of me.
I've never crashed a bike before. It was a bit surreal...
I was leaning the bike over as far as it will go in the wet, and then a little further... The whole thing just *let go.* Couldn't recover the slide and hit the tarmac. The landing was about as hard as falling off a chair sideways.
In that falling instant the bike felt so *heavy*. All two hundred kilos of it.
*Bang,* and the bike and I go pirouetting across the road and into the oncoming lane, bright orange sparks flying everywhere like an angle grinder.
While sliding across my hip I'm thinking, clearly: 'remember this, *this is a crash.*'
I got up shaking like a leaf. Checked to make sure I still had all my fingers.
I did.
A car came flying the other way while I picked up my bike. If they'd been a bit sooner, or me a bit later, it would have been messy...
The old duck in the oncoming car jumps out and gives me a bottle of 'Lucozade'. Sugary drink. Apparently that helps with the *shock*.
Damage to me and the bike was purely cosmetic. Bruises and some missing skin off the fingers for me, nothing a hammer couldn't fix for the bike.
Honestly, with the amount of *Scotch* I drank at some of those Scottish distilleries... I was *very* lucky to get away from the UK so lightly...
Anyway, point being: winter sucks...
Which is why I have to leave.
Which is why I'm in Dover. Which is a shithole.
Right at the arse end of southern England.
On the other side of *The Channel* is *France.*
I don't wanna go.
I'm shitting my pants a bit about the crossing... I don't have the right papers for the bike...
I had to cheat a little to get the bike insured/registered in England because I'm not a resident here. I don't even have an international drivers license... One quick check of my papers at the border and I'll be in the shit...
---
At the long line-up of vehicles for the ferry I do that dickhead thing that motorbike riders do and cut straight to the front.
The bloke behind the perspex takes my ticket, scans it, looks at my passport, and gives it all back.
"That's it?" He waves me on...
Shit.
That was *easy.*
Lax, even...
I roll the bike into the bowels of the ship. The Enfield sounds incredible in this enclosed space (I give it a bit of wrist... Shit yeah!)
I ratchet-strap the beast down for the ride.
*Ta ta, England.*
It's been superb.

## Chapter Five
*Dunkerque.*
How would you say that?
Dunkerque...
I've been saying dunker-cue. Like dunking a cue stick.
Nope. Not Dunker-cue.
*Dunkirk.*
How the fuck have the French got Dunkirk out of Dunkerque?
Anyway. Here we are. Dunkerque.
*France.*
No border post, no Immigration, no Customs, no checks, I just ride straight into the country, no questions asked... I can't believe it.
I try a left turn, and my brain nearly melts...
Everything's back to front... *Arseways...*
I end up on the left side of the road. Which is the wrong side of the road, and half-correct it to get back into the *right* lane...
Head: fucked.
I shake it off...
Belgium is only twenty clicks away. *I can be in three different countries in one day...*
Why wouldn't I?
But first: Petrol.
---
I pull into the first station I come across.
*Gazole...?* What?
*Essence Sans Plomb...?* What the fuck does that mean??
*Which one is petrol?*
This was a mistake. I shouldn't have left the UK.
Fuck. Which is it??
I'm out of my depth here...
I don't think it's gazole. But then again, the Yanks call petrol 'gas'.
Essence?? Sounds like a fucking perfume...
I know 'plomb' means 'lead'. One of those weird things you hear once and never forget...
*Sans?* I thought that was a *font*... Like, 'comic sans', right?
Maybe 'sans plomb' means 'unleaded'. Which means 'essence sans plomb' is the go, and 'gazole' must be diesel...
But that doesn't make sense either, because 'gazole' here is way, *way* cheaper than 'essence', which is arseways. *Again...*
*Petrol* should be cheaper. Right?
"Fuck it!" Essence Sans-Plomb. Done. I brim the tank and head inside to pay.
"Bonjour!"
"Bonjour... erm..." I don't know what to say... *"Essence??"* I point outside at the bowser.
"*Bar bar bar bar?*"
*Fuck.*
From the inflection at the end, that was probably a question... I shake my head, confused. What question would she ask if this was all happening in English? 'How's your day?' This shouldn't be so tricky...
"Aaarrh..." I hand her my credit card. "Essence... *Essence?*" I point again, like that's gonna help.
"*Bar bar bar*" she takes my card. Progress! Words I don't understand flash up on the credit card machine... I put in my PIN.
"*Bar bar bar bar?*"
"Erm, non? Merci?"
She gives me back my card.
I can't tell if it's worked or not... I don't know what to ask...
She's staring at me and I'm staring at her...
"O revoir"
*"O revoir!"* Yes! Goodbye! *Success!*
*Fuck's sake.* That was like pulling teeth. I don't want to do that *ever* again.
Why did I leave the UK? That was *stupid...*
The bike starts. Which is good. *I've won the coin toss.* We roll away.
I even come out of the petrol station on the *right* side of the road.
Things are looking up.
---
I'm approaching my first set of traffic lights, and I pull the clutch handle to wind-down through the gears. *I realise my mistake immediately*, but too late....
*I've pulled the brake handle.*
*Blink.*
My testicles slam into the petrol tank with the full force of my body weight.
*"UGH!!"*
Balls: *Exploded*.
Offspring: *Never*.
My forward momentum grinds my pulverised nuts into the merciless, unforgiving metal tank - which is the least of my problems... The unexpected, sudden braking sends me flying over the handlebars.
*Almost...*
The Enfield is all over the road, I'm perched on the fucking handlebars like an eagle, fulcrumed on my groin, feet nowhere near the footpegs. *Supermanned*.
Finally, I slide back into the seat, feet on the pegs. *Saved it.* Back under control...
I know it's coming before it happens; that awful moment...
Then it happens...
*Nausea.*
I pull over. *Helmet, helmet, helmet!* I start retching before I can undo my chin-strap...
I whip the helmet off, not a second too soon, and blow chunks all over the hedges.
*Call an ambulance.*
---
It takes a long, long time and a bloody long walk to come good again... I think I'd rather have vaulted clean over the handlebars...
What was all that about then? Why the fuck would I grab the brakes when I wanted to grab the clutch??
Very tenderly, I get back onto the bike.
Instead of hitting the ignition I hit the horn button on the other side. I jump out of the seat. And *land hard*.
*Nausea.*
"Fuck...! *What the fuck, brain!?*"
My head's gone way overboard on the whole 'left is right and right is left' rules with the changing lanes. *Everything's switched sides.*
Bizarre.
Fuck this. *What am I doing here?*
This was a mistake.

## Chapter Six
Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, France (again) and Spain.
Waffles, fields, alps, more alps, *more* alps and beaches and tapas.
I've found my groove. My testicles are ok...
It's been a beautiful ride.
And yet all I can think of is work...
*I want to go back.*
I miss it. *Deeply.*
Solid. Reliable. A rock.
*I can't shake it off.*
As I sit, cruising on an Enfield, through gorgeous countries and countrysides, 'living the dream', all I can think of is my cubicle. I want it back. I want my computer. And a home. With a kitchen. And a dog.
This is what I dream of. This is where my head goes.
All the freedom in the world and I don't want to do it anymore. I want to *undo* it.
I don't even *like* cooking. I avoid it, like the plague. So why the fuck am I fantasising about a kitchen?? 
I think I want it because I can't have it... Maybe that's the way things go.
In other news, the Enfield has a new, mysterious oil leak coming from somewhere unseen...
---
It's been a lot of hours with nothing but the Enfield soundtrack, the view in front of my face, and my head in my helmet.
*A lot of hours...*
It's brought me to Barcelona, Northern Spain.
A friend of mine from 'The Bad Place', Jay, is here on holidays with his young family.
It's the first real, meaningful contact that I've had with anyone in long months.
I greet them like the oldest, dearest of friends.
Probably overhugged...
Yeah. Overhugged. Fuck it.
They're here for only a few days, but it's going to be a big few days. Tapas and drinks and good times.
In my excitement I've booked tickets to the MotoGP for me, Jay, and his mate Scotty, who's also here for the good times.
It cost a bomb. It's on tomorrow.
---
We get up late...
*Moving like sloths.*
We're gonna be late... The race is in Zaragoza, *three hundred clicks away.*
After a long hour we're out of the house.
Jay's got his hire car parked a couple of blocks away.
Everything looks the same in Barcelona. The streets are laid out like a block of chocolate, all perfect rows that are *identical.*
We take the wrong turn the first time. *We don't have time for this.*
"C'mon, we're gonna be fuckin late!"
Next block over and there's still no car. We look at Jay...
"I parked it here. I'm *sure* of it."
We look around. Nothing doing...
"You sure mate?"
"Yeah I'm sure!"
Someone's nicked our fucking rental car. Fucking great...
I spot a bit of rubbish stuck to the road where Jay says the car *should* be. A yellow triangle. *It's a sticker...*
I bend to take a closer look.
Spanish words. And a picture of a tow truck...
*Wait...*
I look at the street signs. "Jay..? did you park... *in a disabled bay??*"
"Yeah..."
*Fucking perfect.* Fuck it! The fucking cars been fucking impounded and we're going to miss the fucking MotoGP. *FUCK!!*
What now??
The consensus is to cut our losses. Cut the race. Go enjoy the day, and get the car tonight (at least we know where it's parked).
I'm *steamed* to have put all that money down a hole, but there's really nothing else to do, the die was cast the moment Jay decided it was a good idea to park, overnight, in a fucking disabled bay...
---
It hasn't been that bad a day.
We got to go hang out down at the beach in Barca - where they're quite liberal with the dress code... I've had worse days...
The rental is Jay's, and he parked it in the disabled bay, so it's his problem to deal with.
Scotty and I pull up a chair in the whitewashed waiting room at the impound lot while Jay deals with the Spanish. This place feels like a prison...
Jay comes back and he's livid. *Furious.* Red-face-pissed.
Looks like it's been an expensive day at the beach...
"Fucking *bastards!* They've been charging me *by the hour.*" Jay goes quiet.
"How much mate?"
"Three hundred fucking euros! Can you believe that?!"
We walk to the car. Everyone's silent... You don't want to poke the bear; Jay looks like he's about to put a hole in a wall...
---
Straight to dinner.
Jay's nursing his sangria. He's *filthy*.
I'm built as thick as a rake after weeks of trail running in the Pyrenees, so when I start drinking it shows, *quickly.*
![](/oblivious/images/Image_5.jpg)
In a word: Mouthy...
"C'mon lads, why am I setting pace here? You guys want to finish those drinks?? Come on, let's go. Flick the switch!"
Jay gives me the look of a fucking psychopath. "Flick the switch..? Mate... You want me to *flick the switch??*"
"Yeah! Come on you fucking *bitch!* Flick the switch!"
Jay necks his drink. *Bang.*
*It's on.*
---
I come to...
*Blur.*
Vomit. *My* vomit. Jesus. *Everywhere.*
I'm sitting slumped against the front door of the apartment building we're staying in. Out on the street.
*How'd I get here??*
The memory of leaving Jay and Scotty in the club comes back to me. Messy.
Then spewing in the cab... I can't believe I found the apartment all by myself...
"Whad a fugging mefs. Uuuugh."
On feet.
That's right... *I can't get in.* Can't get through this locked door... I must've given up trying to buzz myself in and passed out on the floor.
This isn't my finest moment. I've never been *like this* before...
I push the button again and again for our apartment, just like before.
No dice, just like before.
*Furious.*
Fi is in there - Jay's wife. I *know* she's in there, *why won't she answer??*
I can't do anything else but buzz: No phone, no one to contact even if I did.
No options.
I sit back down on the floor.
One of the boys will come home eventually...
I'll just sit here till they do.
*Black.*
---
I come to.
*Blur.*
"Dur-fugk?"
Vomit. *My* vomit. Jesus. Everywhere.
"Yark, uuugh."
Burp. *Vile*. Whisky and orange juice and Jägermeister.
"Blarg..."
Fresh retch. Down the chin, down the shirt. Delightful.
I'm slumped against the front door of the apartment building we're staying in.
How'd I get....
*Black.*
---
I come to.
*Getting kicked.*
What am I doing on the floor??
Who's *kicking* me??
Spanish...
*Where am I?*
They're not laying into me, more of a shoe-tap.
"Whag?"
I look around. *Blur.*
The door, *it's open an inch!*
How??
Doesn't matter how. Thank fuck. I'm in. It's *over*.
Stumble up the stairs. *Our door's open!*
Room.
Naked.
Bed.
*Black.*
---
Head.
*Head!*
Argh fuck, *my head!!*
Wait, my *stuff!*
I fly out of bed and pounce on my jeans, check my pockets... Wallet, phone, all present, correct and unadulterated. How is that *possible?* How am *I* unadulterated. Fuck, I could have even mugged me in last night's state...
Jesus tap-dancing Christ, just look at me... This is not going to be a fun day.
I disgust myself. Last night. Jesus. What am I? *Suicidal?* Nothing but self-inflicted, the rate I was buying shots at. What did I expect? I'm not bulletproof...
Fuck. Did I *salsa dance?* Shit... Yep. *What a dickhead.*
Christ, I've never thrown up in a taxi in my life! That poor bastard cabbie.
Ugh. My heeaad!
I need a clean-up. Pronto.
Pants on.
Stumble to the bathroom.
*Retch.*
I retch it all.
I retch till my gut muscles cramp.
*Black.*
---
*Floor.*
Cheek on cold bathroom tile...
I don't remember lying down...
Must've blacked out...
*On feet.*
Face in the mirror. *Christ*, you ugly motherfucker. You look even shitter than you feel.
Ugh. *Still* going cross-eyed... Eye's won't open right.
Pale as a wraith, bloodless face.
Wash up. Towel up.
Stumble down the corridor.
*Black.*
---
*Thump.*
*Trauma.*
---
*Floor.*
Stone floor.
Teeth.
*Teeth!!*
Why are there bits of teeth in my mouth??
No!
*No!*
No fuck no!!
Blood. A pool of blood.
*Adrenaline.*
Up!
*On feet!*
Stumble.
Jay.
Stumble.
*Black.*
---
*Thud.*
*Trauma.*
---
*Jay.*
Blood in mouth.
Rusty blood and vomit and unbrushed-hungover teeth.
Help!
"*Help!!*"
It sinks in. The *magnitude...*
Permanent damage. *Irreversible* damage. My perfect teeth... *Never again*.
I should be dead. That should have caved my head in... I didn't even put my hands out, I fell like a tree...
Jay sits me down. Everyone's woken up with the bang and crack and panicked. Now they're all milling around.
I'm simultaneously drunk, hungover, concussed? and up to my eyeballs in adrenaline. I want something done about this. Fucking *now*!
My face...
"Open up." I bare my teeth.
"I think you've broken your tooth mate."
*Hospital. Now!*
I need to be fixed.
*Pronto.*
Time is of the fucking essence!
"Leg go, we nee to go! Righ now!!"
"Calm down mate, it’s not getting any worse..."
"Fug tha! We nee oo go now!!" Why isn't he taking this seriously!? I feel like a petulant fucking child. But this *is* fucking serious!
---
I find a mirror and inspect the damage while everyone gets dressed.
My lip is absolutely fucked. My front tooth has mangled it on the way through to the stone floor, hit that, and then cracked clean in two.
There's a line running east-west right through the middle of my front tooth. Every time I touch it (and my tongue just *will not stop* playing with it) it sends lightning bolts up my head, enough to make me reflexively try to recoil my head away from itself.
My mouth must be a septic *nightmare.* Vomit and alcohol and not brushing my teeth in over 24 hours isn't exactly a 'sterile environment...'
I try to poke my grisly lip back down into place, like I might if it were my thumb, but it won't push down, it's too mangled and keeps sitting up like a piece of meat pie gristle.
I'm never going to look the same again...
“Fug.”
Can they fix that?
The bottom half of the broken tooth is *wobbly*, but it's still hanging on, still attached, probably by the *roots*.
They *must* be able to fix it.
Even the light pressure of my top lip is enough to move the bottom half of the tooth, which means I have to pout my lips out like a fucking duck, or blow up my cheeks like a fucking monkey to stop the contact.
*Why the fuck is everyone taking so long?*
---
*Finally.*
They're ready to move.
I don't have *any* sympathy for their hangovers. And I'm pissed that they don't seem to give much of a fuck that my life, as it was, will never be the same again.
*Into a cab.*
I'm in the back seat. My tongue just *will not stop touching that tooth*. It feels like it's hanging on by a thread...
*Wait...*
My other tooth...
The *other* front tooth...
I touch it lightly with my tongue.
*That doesn't feel right...*
That's not where it used to be...
Finger confirmation.
Yep. That's well and truly on the piss...
Forced way back on a sickening angle.
I've been focussing so much on that broken tooth that I haven't realised that I've knocked this one way out of joint.
*Jesus.* Instead of breaking like the other one did it just *bent*. How did I not notice that??
Well... There's no easy way to do this...
I put my thumb behind it.
Ooookay...
I pull it forward.
Hard.
Harder... My thumb shakes.
*I give it everything.*
*Crunch.*
I *scream*... In my head.
I've still got the tooth in my grip. I shove it up into my gums with all my force.
*Crunch.*
I make a noise like a wounded animal.
My hand comes away shaking.
This isn't *fair,* *I floss my teeth, for fuck's sake!*
---
*Hospital.*
Needle into my lip.
Anaesthetic.
Some *boy* intern has drawn the short straw, and gets to practice patching up the badly behaved tourist who smells like stale vomit.
Needle pokes in, needle pokes out, needle pokes in, needle pokes out...
Repeat.
Again, and again, and again.
No pain. But I can *feel* everything. The friction and tug of the thread on my lip as he pulls through the full length to start again...
In. Out. In. Out...
*Done.*
"Hoos gon to fis ny tees?"
"No señor, not hospital, *dentist.*"
"Int der sunn sor o *toof surgn,* o suntink??"
"No señor..."
Two hundred and twenty three euros.
That's three hundred and thirty four dollars...
For a few stitches...
Daylight fucking robbery.
---
Taxi.
*Miserable.*
Random, closest dentist.
He clears his schedule. At least he's smart...
And German. And speaks English. And doesn't seem to be judging me... And it's *very* white in here...
We wait in the waiting room for him to finish with the current customer, who he couldn't just kick out of the chair.
Jay and Scotty look thoroughly fucked.
If the shoe was on the other foot, I'd be *pissed.* Poor bastards.
Right. Here we go.
*I have faith.*
He'll fix me...
"What happened??"
"I ferr ower."
"O-kaaay..."
"Nnnnnn hnnnn..."
"Hmmm, well, you've broken your tooth." He grabs a set of pliers.
*Dink*
*"Fug!!"*
Yanked the bottom half of my fucking tooth, clean off!
"Oaaaarrhhhh.."
*No fucking warning.*
Like he's picking fucking daisies.
I squirm in the chair. *My tooth is gone.* Never to return. *Ever.*
The top half of the tooth left behind feels chilly as the air whistles over the roots where the bottom half used to be.
"De ofver toof wath bend back, bad."
"Really? It looks... aligned ok..."
"I straihened ih in da tagsi"
"You straightened it in the taxi?"
"Eh."
"Ok..."
He rustles around. Suddenly the tooth is freezing cold.
"Can you feel that?"
"Yeh!!"
"Ok, your other tooth is still alive, but it's had a bit of trauma... We won't know for a couple of weeks whether or not it'll survive."
"Weegs?"
"Yes, two weeks."
"An da ofver?"
"Well, that one will need a full rebuild with a zirconia crown, and a root canal. *It's a lot of work*. And if the other one dies, it'll need a root canal and a crown as well."
"O-gay" *Fuck.* That's going to cost a fucking fortune.
"If we fit you for a zirconia crown now on the broken tooth, but then the other one dies, the two crowns won't perfectly match. It'll look funny. Does that make sense?" I nod. "Ok, so, you come back in two weeks and we'll do them both at the same time, then they'll be perfectly matched, and we'll send it to the factory to get made. Ok?"
"Bud whad do I do nao?"
"Well, I'll give you a temporary crown, but that'll have to wait till tomorrow, and we'll make you a mouthguard to protect your 'neighbour tooth', and hopefully it'll live."
"Ah. O-gay."
I'm out of the chair.
Nothing's changed, except that he's yanked the bottom half of my tooth off... *That's it...*
There goes my perfect dental record.

## Chapter Seven
Miserable.
Walking around with a half a tooth missing and getting lightning bolts every time something touches it is the pits.
Toothless hick.
I didn't realise it straight after the fall, but I've broken my nose, and hit my head really hard - just to add to the rap sheet. And that *hangover...*
---
Round two with the dentist.
He gives me a root canal on my broken tooth, then shoves a metal spike into my toothhole and moulds a 'temporary crown' around that.
It looks like a piece of chewing gum...
I get a mouthguard, for free, that I have to wear 24/7, even to eat...
---
*I can't stay in Barcelona.* Not for two weeks...
So I flee to somewhere I feel safe: Andorra.
It's only a day's ride from Barca, a tiny country nestled in the Pyrenees. It's gorgeous. The hostel there has a big fireplace, and feels like a rock-cabin retreat for millionaires...
I'm *gone.*
I take the major motorway; fuck the scenic route.
I have a tub of yoghurt for lunch at a petrol station; it's all I can eat with this fucking mouthguard.
Back on the road, and I can see it coming, a long way off...
*Black.* Near pitch...
I start the climb into the Pyrenees mountains.
---
Rain....
*Pissing* rain.
I've never, *ever* seen rain like this before.
Violent! And cold as ice.
Heavy and brutal, in seconds it's running down the back of my neck in rivulets, and under the back of my waterproof-onesie-riding-condom.
I quickly lose the feeling in my fingers and toes.
---
Half an hour of climbing.
It comes down *harder.*
And *colder.*
I'm shivering, *violently*.
Hands and feet turned to wood.
It's fucking *stonking* down. The noise in my helmet is drowning out even the Enfield...
I touch one hand onto the other. It feels like touching a *corpse*. No feeling. It's like my hands don't belong to me anymore.
I'm freaking out. *This is doing me damage.*
*I'll be ok. I'll be ok. I'll be in front of that fireplace before too long.*
*I'll be ok.*
Hot shower soon...
I'll be ok. *I'm not gonna cry.*
---
An hour.
My brain's not working right anymore.
I pull into the hostel. *Finally.*
My feet are so numb it's like walking in a moon boot.
*Locked.*
The doors, are, *locked*…
A message: 'We're on holiday!! Back in a month!'
“No!! *no no no no no no no…*”
I just keep saying it, over and over, while the rain buckets down on me.
*What a clusterfuck…*
Right. Now what?
My fingers refuse to work. I can't get the waterproof pocket open on my jacket to get my phone out.
My fingers; they just won't cooperate. And there's nowhere to get warm... I have to use my teeth to open the velcro pocket, with that fucking mouthguard...
The pocket rips opens.
There's my phone; swimming in two inches of water.
"FUCK!! Faaaaaaaaaaaaark. Oh fuck it!!"
Woe is me.
I sit, under a little overhang. Shivering, with my busted face, fucked-up lip and silly mouthguard, and sulk.
*So much for my safe place...*
Nothing left for it. Gotta go...
---
I head all the way back down the valley to the tourist information centre. I walk in, wringing wet.
*At least it's warm...*
I ask the old duck behind the counter if there’s another hostel in the country. She just throws me an accommodation booklet. Like, *'you figure it out'*.
Can't find any hostels, but there is an 'aine' which *seems* to be like a hostel... I ask the duck if she can make a phone call for me to make sure they have a bed available.
Nope. Can’t do that. *It’s against the rules.*
Whatever. I'm fucking past caring.
I smile at her - with my garish mouthguard and fucked lip - give a 'gracies' in Catalan, and shake off as much water as I can on the walkout.
---
All the way up the valley in the pissing rain we go.
The 'aine' is huge.
And *deserted.*
I’m looking in all the windows and it’s just big open spaces with no one in them.
The place looks abandoned...
Clearly abandoned.
I’m starting to have to push back the panic. *I'm so cold.*
If I can get inside I’ll just squat there for the night...
Worth trying.
I try the front door.
*It's unlocked!* Joy of joys!
I go walking through the place.
"Halloooooo...? Hallooooooooooo??" My weird, mouthguardy voice echoes off the walls.
Other than that, it’s dead silent.
I poke my head into what looks like the old admin, and shit my pants: *there’s someone here.*
My saviour!
He hasn’t heard me because he’s had his headphones in while he’s working on his computer.
I ask for a room for the night.
"No, uh, booked. Complet."
I look around. What??
*"What??"*
Apparently, there's not a single bed available for the night.
Neither his English nor my Catalan/Spanish are good enough to get a reasonable explanation of how that could *possibly* be true.
It all feels like some sick joke.
I *beg* him for a bed.
Then grovel, *from my knees.*
Nope.
Nothing. This arsehole doesn't budge.
He turns me out, into the rain...
---
Back to the bitch at the tourist centre. I'm not impressed that her 'rules' have just cost me forty minutes in the pissing rain. And it's getting later, and *darker.*
I make a none too subtle effort to get all of my wetness on her desk.
Cop. That. Bitch.
I find an expensive hotel close-by.
It's either that, or go to the hospital...

## Chapter Eight
*Fuck Andorra.*
I ditched it.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_6.jpg)
I've spent the two weeks of purgatory riding through northern Spain, and taken my munted head with me.
Every stitch in my lip has fallen out. *Way too soon.*
The kid intern botched the job...
My lip is a gnarly, lumpy mess. Like a ball of puss.
I lick it all the time.
It's like licking a scab...
*I can't help it.*
I'm sure it's going to go septic.
It's the smell...
*I'm never gonna be ok again.*
Eating food with a mouthguard on... Jesus... What could *possibly* be more retarded?
The 'neighbour tooth' has changed colour.
Fade to black...
Besides the tooth, some other things have taken a strange turn. I was cooking up some burritos and talking to one of the girls in a hostel when I very suddenly couldn’t concentrate on the conversation... Things went really dizzy all at once and I had to quickly grab hold of the kitchen bench to stop myself from falling over. My head went all fizzy and fuzzy as the room kept *spinning.*
I was sure I was about to black out.
It all happened in a moment, and took me completely by surprise.
It lasted maybe five seconds before things slowly started to come back to normal, but I continued to feel *weird.*
Either I handled it with aplomb, or the Yank wasn’t paying attention, because she didn’t seem to notice anything had happened…
I’ve been analysing the shit out of it.
Obviously something's caused it, but I’ll be buggered if I know what that is. I've been in overdrive trying to figure it out, but I'm coming up with doughnuts.
Like the proverbial ostrich, I’ll stick my head in the sand and pretend like it didn’t happen.
Nothing to see here...
---
Barcelona.
My *favourite* place.
The neighbour tooth didn't make it...
Over the last week and a bit I've had another root canal, and two zirconia crowns put in.
One thousand eight hundred and twenty euros.
What's that in dollars? Two and a half-ish grand?
Honestly, that's not that bad. Cheap even, considering the *days* of work that have been put into me...
I reckon I would have gone for four times that much back home.
And the quality? Well... I'm not happy. There's a gap between my front teeth that wasn't there before... They don't really *feel* like they're mine; they feel ginormous in my mouth. Too much girth.
And they feel *loose*. Every time I eat I can just imagine my teeth tearing clean out of my gums...
*Fun.*
And I talk with a fucking lisp now.
But, on the upside, the crowns *look* legit - they don't look like they're not mine.
It's a better outcome than I expected, I guess...
---
I'm staying in the cheapest hostel I could find here in Barca.
The whole mob is out tonight, boozing it up at a 'beach bar'. Loud music and good times, right on the coast.
We're all pretty merry...
I've met two interesting people. One is a gorgeous Canadian, who I reckon is giving me the *'glad eye'.* Ball-'o-puss-lip and everything. I can't really believe it, but, then, *there it is again...*
*That* look...
I've Australianised her name to *Shazza.*
The other interesting person is Ben the Australian. He's a maniac. A very *calm* maniac. We had a chat in the hostel before heading out, and the guy's got stories to tell.
He's *hitchhiked* up *Africa*.
My new hero.
Ben's paired off with the other girl from Canada, and it's looking like being a good night...
Sick of the music, a mob of us head down to the shoreline for a break. I don't know when it happened, but I'm arm in arm with Shazza. We watch the waves roll in with the thump of the music from the club in our backs...
The *other* Canadian strips off her clothes and sprints into the water. Ben the Australian - calm as you like - strips down and casually strolls in too. No rush...
Our fearless leader from the hostel, a drop-dead gorgeous, born-again hippie with thick red hair like something out of a fucking *shampoo commercial*, takes off her loose fitting summer dress in one smooth movement like something from a fucking dream. She *catwalks* into the white wash.
Who knew she hadn’t been wearing underwear *this whole time...?*
Sweet baby Cheeses...
Shazza has to pick my jaw up off the floor for me. Like a fucking cartoon. She's not even mad…
After the necessary drunken frolic the whole motley crew head back into the club, covered in sand and dripping wet.
This *is* going to be a good night...
---
The mob thins out to me, Ben the Australian, and the two Canadian girls.
In a moment alone, I kiss Shazza. She seemed to like it. I *still* can't believe it... Maybe she has a fetish for guys who look like they've been in a hockey fight? I don't know. *Don't look a gift horse in the mouth...*
We decide that a swim is actually a *brilliant* idea.
So back down to the shore we go, and Shazza and I head in, with Ben the Australian and the other Canadian standing guard over our clothes.
*Good times.*
There's something about being naked in the ocean... Nothing quite like it...
Back up onto the sand, I'm pulling the jeans through my crusty, sandy feet and up my wet legs.
They feel *light...* 
I pat myself down... *Flat.* Empty...
*Panic.*
All my shit’s gone.
Wallet. New two-week-old phone that cost a fucking fortune.
I look over the sand...
Nothing. *Gone.*
*"FUCK!!"*
The thieving bastard left my jeans behind. How kind of him...
But, you know what, *I don't even care.*
Nothing can ruin this night.
*I never thought anyone would kiss me again for the rest of my life...*
---
During an even wilder, far more debaucherous night the following evening, I make a solemn vow to the group that I will not buy another phone till I am 'in the foetal position and crying' for want of a rectangle... Seems healthy...
It's a vow I plan to keep.

## Chapter Nine
Winter is coming...
I've done a half decent job of outrunning the winter so far, with only the occasional hypothermia-inducing downpour, but I've run out of mainland Europe to escape south to.
There's nowhere else left to hide.
Except *Africa.*
I was going to garage the bike and go skiing till the weather came good again...
But then, Ben showed up.
Ben and his fucking *epic* stories.
He was planning on hitchhiking down to West Africa.
*Hitchhiking.* Again...
"Piss on that. Come on the back of the Enfield. We'll go together. You n me."
"Ok."
And so, I adopted him.
---
Ben bought a helmet - that morning - and we were off.
Two up, on a Royal Enfield.
It was like something out of *The Motorcycle Diaries.* Except this guy wasn't my best mate...
---
![](/oblivious/images/Image_7.jpg)
In a very short space of time we've covered some serious mileage, put in some serious hours. Ben hasn't complained *once*, even after ten hour days on that back-seat. Must've been a nightmare, *the thing's the size of a hand...* Yet, not a peep. Half the time I forget he's even there, and I start singing to myself. He's so *quiet.*
The Enfield hasn't skipped a beat. It's handled the overload with aplomb.
The three of us have gone down the Mediterranean coast of Spain, till now, we find ourselves, on the *rock of Gibraltar*.
The end of Europe.
*The Strait.*
I can *see* Africa.
I can't believe how *close* it is.
That's bloody *Africa*, right there!
![](/oblivious/images/Image_8.jpg)
I'm shitting bricks.
I've asked Ben a thousand times. About everything. *Every possible thing.*
I'm *not* convinced that Africa can be done. At least not like this...
I feel like I need a *'War Room'* of people back home, some sort of support. People who can sort shit out and send in the Marines when the proverbial shit hits the fan.
Y'know, *organisation.*
*Backup plans.*
Ben assures me it won't be a problem...
*I trust him.* But I'm sceptical as fuck.
He's so *lackadaisical*, so thoroughly *nonplussed.*
He seems to be bordering on boredom...
Is that assuring? Or concerning...?
---
We show up at a monstrous shipping port, pick a boat that looks like it's leaving soon, and ask to go to Morocco.
Yep. No worries.
We pay, and ride into the hull.
The ship leaves.
No questions asked.
*Easy...*
---
Passport, prepare to get *devirginated.*
*Morocco...*
Fucking *Africa.*
My first ever, *proper* border crossing.
It's too many firsts at once...
I'm not prepared for this.
For a start, I don't have the papers. *Not even close.*
I'm missing a *'carnet'* (pronounced car-nay), which is a special set of travel documents for the bike, like a passport for vehicles... In just the same way that I can't cross a border without a passport, I can't take a vehicle across a border without a carnet.
So... *That's* going to be fun...
I also don't have an up-to-date *yellow fever certificate*, which is another dealbreaker (I've had the injection, I just don't have it *officially* written down anywhere...)
So, between not having a carnet, not having an up to date yellow card, not having an international drivers license, not having legitimate bike insurance, not having anti-malarial tablets, not having any visas and not having any fucking idea, I'm feeling a bit out of my depth, and vulnerable...
Tossed naked into the deep end.
Shit. I don't even know *French*, let alone *Arabic...*
This is a bad idea...
The mountains of Morocco loom large through the fog, getting closer and closer. I think Ben's ready to fall sleep...
---
Ok, *here we go...*
The guards or border officials or whatever are nothing short of *resplendent*.
Flamboyant sky-blue military style get-up. They look just like Paul McCartney in the *Sgt Peppers* cover, except with hats...
Ben *loves* it. He reckons they’re the best dressed border guards on the planet. And he'd know.
I park up the Enfield at the post, and it's a *circus.*
Three carloads of people, maybe five guards or officials or whatever, and everyone's *yelling.*
Moving and yelling.
No English.
Forms in French and Arabic are being moved about.
I've got no fucking idea what I'm supposed to do...
Ben starts quietly doing his thing, grabbing forms and filling them out for himself...
I feel like that kid at school trying to cheat off everyone else, but I'm way behind the curve. Like, *way* behind.
Ben's no help.
*Fuck.* I thought he was going to help me through this...
The bastard does his paperwork in ten minutes, gets stamped into the country, and goes and sits in the corner and waits for me.
Mother. Fucker.
Alright, guess I'm on my own then...
I try to grok it, but there’s no rhyme or reason or procedure. It’s not obvious who I have to talk to, or what papers I need to show, or what paperwork I need to fill out, or how *any* of it fits together.
No one wants to help me.
But, then again, no one wants to fuck me either, which is a relief.... I was sure that the moment it became evident I was an utter novice at this that someone, or everyone, would try and pull my pants down...
Nope.
It seems like I'm more of an irritation than anything; I get the distinct feeling that I'm giving everyone the shits with my English tongue.
I bounce around the border post, try to keep smiling, and, eventually, *somehow,* I end up with a visa in my passport and a 'laissez-passer' for the bike. I dunno what that is, it's just a slip of paper with incomprehensible gibberish and a stamp... Might be something like a temporary carnet..?
So. Is that it??
No one's stopping me from leaving...
I go collect Ben, and we ride out.
*I'm in.*
I’m in *Africa...*
Holy fuck... *What am I going to eat??*
---
As the sun sets, Ben and I make it into Tangier, the closest city to the port.
It's a madhouse.
It's full of confusing tight alleyways that spaghetti all over the place.
*Thick* with people.
The thumping bike makes a hell of a noise in the tight space and draws a *lot* of attention.
The place reeks of cat piss, and already the locals are haranguing us.
Hell of a welcome.
I might have to get used to this...
It doesn't *feel* like Africa. It feels like *Aladdin*, with cat piss. 
It's so confusing and tight that finding a hostel on two wheels is impossible.
Ben goes on foot to sleuth it out.
I’m on red alert - *someone is gonna to rob me.*
The locals won't leave me alone...
I want to go back to Spain...

## Chapter Ten
*Dinner time.*
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that, even if I'm careful, anything I stick in my mouth isn't even going to touch the sides on the way through...
One drop of Moroccan water in one end is going to turn things into a fire hydrant out the other...
*Whoosh...*
Ben and I are walking the streets, and we come across my *exact* nightmare: A crusty, homeless looking vendor is selling *meat sandwiches* from a push cart. Like the Moroccan version of a hot-dog seller.
*Revolting.*
Fucking horrorshow. There’s raw meat, sitting there, in the open. Then there’s tomato, lettuce and olives - amongst other mystery fillings - that are *glistening* with water. 
Ben asks how much for a sandwich, gets a response, then asks for how much with *double meat...*
*Zing!*
*I piss myself.* I never knew he had a sense of humour!
Everyone, Ben included, stops to stare at me...
The walnutted little Moroccan says something to Ben in French. Ben nods his head and puts up one finger.
The little old Moroccan man goes to work, fanning his hot coals and throwing the mystery meats onto the grill...
Finally, I find the words: “Ben! *What the fuck??*”
"What?"
"Are you *suicidal??* You can’t eat that!"
His expression is a mirror of mine...
“What's the problem?”
If this is a joke it's quickly getting elaborate...
“You are *not* going to eat that.”
“Why not?”
“You’ll fucking *die!*”
“Come one mate, really? Look," He gestures at the meat "he’s cooking it right there in front of us. This is as good as it gets...”
*Shit a brick.*
I'm not going to last here... Not if this is 'as good as it gets'. How could it *possibly* get worse??
*Shit.*
Shit, shit, shit...
I give the human walnut a peace sign. *Two, thanks...*
Explosive diarrhoea, here I come.
The nut asks a question. I look at Ben.
"Double meat?"
Ugh. "Wee. Yes..." In for a penny in for a pound. Right?
We watch as the chef finishes up with the double meat, and goes heavy on the fillings into a baguette. The sandwich is *enormous...*
It's hot. Actually smells alright...
I want to eat it back at the hostel, preferably already sitting on the toilet...
But Ben's having none of it, apparently that wouldn't be right. Bad manners, or something like that.
Well, *when in Rome…*
I wait for Ben to take the first bite - a part of me *still* thinks he's taking the piss - but he doesn't hesitate, and tucks right in...
So I take a bite too.
It's *delicious*. A delicious fucking *time-bomb*.
I scoff it all and then double-time it the fifteen minute walk back to the hostel.
I make it without shitting my pants.
A relief. But it's coming, I can *feel* it.
---
We spend the night hanging out with a couple of other backpackers. I can't really focus on the conversation; every ounce of my mental energy is funnelled into feeling for the *slightest* movement from my bowels, and hearing every noise that's coming from outside in case someone's stealing or defiling my Enfield.
*I can't believe I have to leave it out on the street.*
Disaster's imminent. One way or the other. I can *feel* it.
The second time I head to the window to make sure there's no one there, Ben gives me a disappointed look and a shake of the head.
*He looks a little angry.*
Five minutes later and I hear *another* noise. I have to get up to check, but Ben stops me dead.
"Get up one more time and I'll belt the shit out of you. *Stop* it."
"What?? I've gotta know!"
"No, you don't. Let it go mate. You're not going to do this every-single-time. So stop. *Now.*"
I acquiesce.
I'm not gonna sleep well...
---
Ok.
*Ben's the man.*
The Enfield is still there, my bowels are still intact.
I've decided that Ben's going to be my guru.
Mr Miyagi. Grasshopper.
Yoda. Skywalker.
It's gonna be the opposite of comfortable emulating this guy, but boundaries have to move...
*Give less of a shit. Be more reckless.*
Mum's gonna be stoked…
We stroll through Tangier with a couple of girls from the hostel, Ben pipes up.
"Do you feel like a child?"
"What?? A child?"
"Do you feel... like a child?"
"What the fuck are you talking about?"
"Wearing shorts. Does it make you feel like a child?"
"Ben. Explain yourself..."
"Do you see any *other* men wearing shorts?"
"Erm..." I take a look around, "No?"
"No."
*Noted...*

## Chapter Eleven
After consuming a lot of meat sandwiches, frothy mint teas, delicious bread, addictive avocado and banana smoothies and more omelettes than I care to mention, we find ourselves at the bottom of Morocco.
It's been about a month.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_9.jpg)
*Nothing's gone wrong,* but I wouldn’t go rushing back to Morocco. It's a bit of a tourist trap, and I *hate* being harassed. Happy to be moving on.
On the way through, we picked up a bald Belgian guy named Tony. He's heading south in a Volkswagen van that can best be described as a 'Swiss army knife'.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_10.jpg)
I'm glad we found him. *He has beer and rum.*
But, better than that, Ben's been more than happy to ride shotgun in the van, and I'm happy to chuck all of my shit in the back, leaving me, naked, on the Enfield.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_11.jpg)
It's been *glorious.*
We've been surfing all down the coast.
I've learned how to shit in a 'squat toilet'. It's basically just a hole in the floor... Once you get the hang of it - and stop accidentally pissing on your shoe - it’s quite an effective way to do business. Gone in 60 seconds... And I've finally got my eye in; these day's it's *nothing but net...*
Swish.
Life skills.
I've learned how to talk with my new teeth, and I've dropped the lisp. Those front two chompers are finally beginning to 'set', and not feel so *wobbly* all the time.
All to the good.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_12.jpg)
Speaking of good, Shazza decided to paratroop into Marrakesh for a fun week. She managed to re-align my broken nose with a stray headbutt during some bedroom gymnastics... The pleasure and the pain...
On the way south, Tony the Belgian picked up two other strays; a mongrel puppy that he's named Synchro (after his van), and a Greek hitchhiker named Manos.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_13.jpg)
We've all procured Mauritanian visas at the embassy in Morocco with ease; it's just a matter of showing up, saying you want a visa, filling out your details, paying, and wham, *visa;* we're now officially welcome in the country...
From here, the die is cast: West. *The west coast.*
We can't change tack from here, because, *Sahara.*
We lost Ben.
Which was a shame.
A few days back we parted ways because he didn't want to camp out. So he just hitchhiked out of there, straight to the border without us. *I don't know how he does it...*
Thankfully though, this isn't Tony's first rodeo; he's been down this way before. So, with him and Manos the Greek, I feel pretty confident...
---
The border's in the middle of the middle of nowhere.
Tony the bald Belgian tells me that in between the two borders are four kilometres of *'no man's land'.*
"What the fuck are you *talking* about Tony?? *No man's land?* This isn't *The Western Front..!*"
Tony elaborates. Apparently Morocco and Mauritania don’t like each other very much after the war they had fighting over the Western Sahara in the '70’s. Mauritania got belted, and they haven't seen eye to eye since.
So, because of this, the no man's land is filled with mines.
Not *dig-dig* mines but *bang-bang* mines.
Fucking *landmines*.
Tony's advice is "don't stray off the road."
Thanks Tony...
If I wasn't shitting myself before, I am now.
*Landmines* aren't our only problem, Tony's van is packed full of smuggled rum and beer, and Mauritania is so uber-Muslim that alcohol is completely forbidden.
*Everywhere.* Completely dry.
Add Synchro the puppy to the equation in and things could get interesting...
---
We pull in at nine o’clock in the morning in a drizzling rain.
Yes, *rain...*
There’s a monster line of cars and trucks waiting to get in at the Moroccan border post. More than I can count...
And I thought we’d got in early...
*Where the fuck has all this traffic come from??* We haven't seen hardly anyone in *days...*
On two wheels I go do that dickhead thing and ride straight on through the gridlock and park up at the front. I jump off the bike and wait for the other guys to catch up.
Breakfast: omelette, baguettes and tea.
By the time I'm done with that, the other guys have cut the line by half.
I decide, being the novice of the crew, to go in and get a head start...
---
Fucking *circus.*
*Again.*
The Moroccan border post is a bunch of small buildings spread over half the size of a football pitch.
I don’t know what I need to do to get out of the country, or who needs to know what...
*No idea...*
So, I just bounce around the buildings, walking where I'm told, following instructions, and basically do what everyone else is doing.
Monkey-see, monkey-do.
I take a guess at what the right answers are in the French forms until Tony and Manos arrive at the post to save the day.
Eventually, all the required boxes are ticked, passports are 'exit stamped' and we’re out.
*No going back.*
We head into no man's land, and the tarmac *disappears.*
*There is no road...*
It’s just open-ish yellow land with random tyre tracks snaking all over the place in the sand and rock.
Different tracks... *Everywhere.*
Fuck... *Which track is 'the road'?*
I thought we were going to be on a proper fucking road! Like, fucking *bitumen!*
Tony's going first in the van, like the canary in the coal mine...
I stick to his wheel-tracks like glue. If he doesn't blow up, I don't blow up.
*Right?*
Tony, in his turn, is right up the arse of the car in front of him. 
There are a surprising number of people just walking about out here. Loitering. Christ knows what they're up to. *Seems dodgy.* I don't know why, but I think of them like pirates...
There's lots of burnt out car wrecks too, just in case I needed any reminders that this could end very fucking badly…
Shitting. It.
Where it's not soft sinking sand - which is a nightmare on the bike - it's razor sharp, pointy rocks instead. *Flat tyre city.*
I'm praying to just make it out the other end. If I get a puncture out here... Shit...
*Four crawling kilometres...*
---
No one died.
Everyone's *black*.
*Everyone.*
Like, *uber-black.*
Black Africa. Couldn't be more in contrast with 'Arabian' Morocco.
Again, I skip straight to the front of the line by virtue of my two wheels.
The Mauritanian side of the post is making the Moroccan circus look positively *organised.*
It’s roughly the same size as the Moroccan post, but there are people *everywhere.*
*Total chaos.*
Gone are the resplendent baby blue uniforms of the border guards. No 'official' type people to be seen anywhere... 
I park up right in front of the final boom gate out of the border post, where there's a military-ish looking bloke with an enormous gun.
I hope he’ll keep an eye on my shit... Though he doesn’t look too happy to see me...
I take off my helmet and give him a big smile and a knowing nod.
I switch off the ignition.
Like flies to shit I'm surrounded in seconds by *fixers* and money changers. 
Everyone's pulling and touching and pestering me.
*Immediate overload.*
*Mobbed.*
My heart starts smashing so hard in my chest I can *feel* my pulse.
*I'm out of my depth...*
Externally though, I'm *calm like a bomb;* with a little smile on my face and a wave of my hand that says 'I’m a travelling veteran, don't waste your time boys, kindly fuck off'.
I shake off the clowns as best I can and head off to the 'Gendarmerie'; which is a special police sort of thing, I think...
I’m going to stick to doing things in the order that they were in when I came into the border: Gendarmes - Douanes - Police/Immigration.
It’s as good a plan as any...
The Gendarmerie is *crammed* with people. Squashed. People are spilling out onto the veranda. There's no semblance of a line or order. Just a mosh pit.
I’m soaking up every detail I can, and I notice that everyone, and I mean *everyone*, has in their hand a little laminated piece of paper that looks like a special, crappy, drivers license.
*No one’s holding a passport...*
I don’t know what the laminated paper is - because it’s all written in French - but I know that I don’t have one.
My heartrate spikes, again.
I give my imagination it's reins, and it bolts in every possible direction, trying to figure out what the fuck's going on...
I’ve only just started and I've already got a nightmare on my hands.
I can feel a confrontation coming on. I *hate* confrontation. In any form. It makes me feel sick and queasy in the guts. Even the thought of it, or the potential of it, is enough to make my head fizz.
I ask the punters what the laminated paper is. I'm asking in English, which is neither Arabic nor French, and of course I’m getting doughnuts back...
They all want to see my passport, which ain’t gonna happen...
With my sense of white entitlement I muscle my way into the dimly lit room.
My eyes take a moment to adjust.
Everyone’s clamouring to give their magic card to an un-uniformed man sitting at a desk in front of a couple of notepads. He’s taking down peoples details. Nothing about him say’s that he’s a 'Gendarme', but he must be; there’s no one else working here...
I keep pushing forward to try to get to the front.
Mr Plain Clothes lifts his head and spots me in the mosh.
He gestures for me to come forward.
I take my best guess and give him my passport.
*Pray.*
He asks me a question I don’t understand and gets my standard response that sounds like “Dessolay, je ne parl pa fransais”- Sorry, I don’t speak French...
He asks another question (or was it the same question?) and gets the same response.
While I hold my breath he goes to his notepad and starts writing, he then gives me back my passport plus a little, unintelligible slip of paper. He grabs the magic card of the next person...
*I think I’m done here...*
I mentally dance a jig as I walk out onto the veranda.
*Fuck yeah.*
That went way more smoothly than I thought it would...
Those things that looked like licenses were probably just licenses.
I need to calm the fuck down.
---
By the time I’ve negotiated the Gendarmerie, Tony and Manos have arrived in the post and they go through the same process.
Now we’re the three amigos again, and we head off together to get the 'laissez-passer', that temporary carnet thingo. For that, we need to talk to the 'Douanes', which is the Customs mob...
Manos the Greek wants nothing to do with it (he doesn't have a vehicle…), so he just sits this one out.
The Douanes building is just a shed, and like the Gendarmerie it's overflowing with people all clamouring to get the attention of the man with the books.
We find the forms we need to fill in and head out onto the veranda to fill them out. As soon as it’s obvious that I don’t know French or Arabic - and therefore have no idea what I'm doing - the fixers all pile into me.
One of them decides on the 'I’ll force my help on you now, and you’ll have to pay later' approach; he's telling me what to write down *while I'm already writing it down.* His tenacity is really starting to give me the shits...
I feel like a cheating kid again, looking over Tony’s shoulder trying to shark the right answers. But he’s not exactly in the mood to help a brother out; he furiously writes down all his answers like they’re giving out prizes for speed, ignoring my pestering questions like "Hey, what the fuck does 'immatriculation' mean?" he finishes up, and goes and hands it in.
Thanks a fuckin lot...
Oddly, there's another whitey, a French guy, who is also trying to negotiate the border post, so I sidle up to him and try to sneak the rest of my test.
I finish my answers as best I can, hand in my sheet, and we wait.
---
Nothing happens...
Tony's getting the shits with how long it's all taking. The Frenchie is using a fixer, and Tony jumps onto the bandwagon.
I'm not sure... *They all seem like crooks to me.*
But, if Tony gets through quickly with the fixer, and leaves me here stranded, alone, well... that's not a risk I'm happy taking.
At least if the fixer fucks it up, we're all fucked together.
Mob mentality. Strength in numbers.
Money changes hands and time passes with seemingly no progress.
No one seems to know what's going on.
Disturbingly, I’ve given my passport and papers to someone I don’t know from a bar of soap and I’ll be buggered if I know where they are now. Off into the ether...
All we get from our useless fixer are platitudes that it’ll all be sorted soon.
---
*Hours...*
We’ve all reached the end our tether with the nagging money changers, the *still* pestering fixers, and our useless *bastard* fixer.
*We’re all ready to snap.*
Right when Tony is shaping up to go fucking postal, we get our papers back: passports, regos and the all-important laissez-passer.
We can finally move on.
Walking to Immigration, we inspect the new LP’s.
We’ve only been given *seven days*.
One week!?
It's *impossible;* Mauritania’s fucking huge, and on slow Royal Enfield it’s even bigger.
It’s just not going to happen.
Our fixer comes in for some verbal treatment from just about everyone.
*Fucking lynch him...*
He says he'll fix it, and heads off into the crowd.
We never see him again, of course...
Group meeting time; the consensus is that the fixer skimped on the amount spent on the LP, getting a shorter duration to save money, and then pocketed the difference.
Clever fucker.
We take our indignation back to the Douanes and *demand* and extension.
*“Um-pos-ee-bleh”.*
Even I know that one...
We’re told our only two options are to return to the border after seven days and go through the whole clusterfuck again, *or* we can go to the Douanes in the capital, and hope they'll give us an extension.
Bugger option one in the arse. I’d rather eat dog shit than come back to this border post...
Option two isn’t that much better; we'll be putting ourselves in their power. With zero leverage it'll be easy to get put over the barrel...
Tony’s on the same wavelength that both those options suck, and he’s not having any of it either. He *demands* to talk to the head of the Douanes.
"Onya Tony!!"
We ride on Tony’s coattails into a different building, and then spend an inordinate amount of time getting passed around and waiting.
I’ve still got no idea what the fuck's going on. I just sit and nod my head...
---
Tony finally talks us up to *the boss*.
*He's a she.*
Which for a country like Mauritania is a bit of a headfuck. *She doesn't even have her head covered.*
After an explanation from Tony, and no money changing hands, she takes the LP’s back to Mr Um-pos-ee-bleh, has a word. He writes something on the LP, stamps it, and that’s it.
*Easy as that.*
So much for impossible... Arsehole.
Our hero vanishes before we notice that they've extended the LP from seven days to ten days.
*This is beyond a joke.*
We start the cycle of indignation again and then realise that it’s futile. 
We’ve all had enough of it and just want it to be over now; cut the losses and move on.
---
On the way to Police/Immigration I check in on the Enfield.
Being the gorgeous machine it is, it always draws a crowd of admirers, which, rather than being pleasant, is more scary than anything...
*It's got everything I own on it.*
*I’m* not even that slick, and I could steal everything off that bike in under ten seconds. *Easy.* Simply undo the straps that hold it to the seat and it all lifts away.
Piece of cake.
Yet, it hasn't been touched.
It always surprises me...
We head into Immigration.
---
What a shambles.
I'm *knackered*. My brain's not working like it should...
Everyone’s moving about but nothing seems to be getting done. Whoever has the least manners is the person who gets served next. The officials are behind closed doors, and only pop their heads out into the hallway to grab a new passport.
Tony and Manos are particularly irritable. We’ve been at the border for about six hours now and we’ve spent most of that time standing around waiting. Neither of them have eaten anything since an early breakfast at camp maybe eight hours ago, and both of them look as though they’re about to crack shits.
There's no one here to take it out on either, so we end up venting our spleens at each other...
*We can't skip this...* It's a simple thing we need; just an ink stamp with the date and the 'port of entry/exit' on it, but it's *vital*. If we don't get entry/exit stamps in our passports, then we've illegally entered/exited that country. Deep shit... Ben's been *deported* for that before...
Every now and again there’s a glimmer of hope and a mad scramble at the door as it opens a crack, only to be closed again.
Ratchet the frustration.
The next time the door opens the three of us practically *throw* our passports through the gap.
Then wait.
Whenever the door opens we see our passports slowly getting buried to the bottom of an ever-growing pile. It’s starting to make sense why there’s a small, shitty hotel inside this border post...
Tony’s had a gutful, is furious, and barges into the room on the next opening.
Riding his coattails again, we all pile in.
Everyone wants to rant, but we keep a lid on it: honey catches more flies than vinegar...
Some questions later and we have our stamped passports.
*It’s over.*
We form up and roll out.
Into Mauritania...
*How the hell did this happen??*

## Chapter Twelve
*Mauritania.*
It's a country, and it's *not* Mauritius.
Couldn't be further from it...
According to the map, there are only two 'cities' in Mauritania.
I wouldn't even call Nouadhibou that...
*What a shitheap.*
A dirty, smoky, filthy chaos.
The other 'city' is a half day's ride away. Not an option...
The troupe of three have gone from being mildly conspicuous in Morocco to standing out like dogs balls here; all eyes are on us. It's unnerving, and weird.
The first accommodation option we pick out is an absolute *shocker.* I’m all for keeping it rough and cheap, but this place is *beyond.*
*Way* beyond.
Filthy mattresses on the floor, and I can *see* the bed bugs.
Actually fucking *see* them crawling...
The search continues.
The second place we roll into looks more promising...
Out of one of the rooms comes *Ben*, grinning like an idiot. Small world...
Ben vouches for the place (he hasn’t seen any bed bugs yet…) so we shack up.
---
*Lunch.*
The first place we come across is peddling pasta with grisly mystery meat. I'm hungry. Manos and Tony are starving. It'll do.
We tuck in and compare notes from the border...
Tony’s making the call that it’s the worst border crossing he’s ever done.
*Ever...*
*Thank fuck for that.* If that border was par-for-the-course... I just couldn't...
After Ben parted ways with us two days ago he immediately hitchhiked to the border, managed to clear the Moroccan post, and then *walked* no man's land *that night*.
He got caught stranded on the Mauritanian side - they'd closed up for the night, so he stayed at that 'hotel'.
The next day he was first in line to clear the border and hitchhiked to Nouadhibou. *Easy peasy...*
We shove the pasta into our faces, and have a laugh that we’re now in 'black Africa' and cheers our teacups to that.
The awesome foursome ride again.
---
No one gets violently ill after lunch, and there's quickly an appetite for dinner.
“Senegalese sandwiches” are on the menu, off the street. Pretty simple stuff: a French baguette, fill it with anything deep-fried, then drown that in sauce.
*Delicious heart attack.*
While I'm eating my second sandwich I have a bitch about my financial situation. I can't pull money from *any* of the cash machines here. Rejected, every time.
Tony wants to know what card I'm using...
"A MasterCard, why?"
Tony laughs. "Got a Visa card?"
"No. Why?"
More laughter. “Good luck”.
"*Why is that funny?* What are you talking about??"
"MasterCard won't work in West Africa, just Visa. How could you not know that?"
"What?? How *could* I know that?? I don't believe you... It's *MasterCard!* It worked in Morocco!"
"Yeah well, good luck."
"What..? *Ugh...*"
It'll work.
It *has* to work. *It can't not work,* otherwise I can't get money...
Ben interrupts my thoughts.
"I'm heading to Chinguetti tomorrow on an iron ore train. Who wants to come?"
*"What??"*
"I'm heading to Chinguetti tomorrow on an iron ore train... Want to come?"
"*How* are you doing that?"
"Hitchhiking."
"That doesn't help mate..."
"Hitchhiking in the carriages is allowed. And it's free."
"What?? You're making that up... How long's the ride?"
"Twelve hours..."
---
This is fucking *crazy.*
We're fucking mad.
Christ, if this wasn't an adventure before, it sure as fuck is now...
The Enfield had to stay behind. Can't get it on the train. I don't know how I'm going to get it back. I've left it at a random motel after our motelier wouldn't keep it for me.
No guarantees it will stay there...
I don't feel good about it, but I didn't want to miss out on this...
We sit on the side of the empty rails and wait.
No motorbike, not a lot of cash, and just a change of clothes in a 'daypack'. That's it...
Me, Manos and Ben.
Tony the Belgian is too smart for this, and has continued on south...
There's a sign next to the tracks, a big one, evidently put up by the mining company. It says a bunch of stuff in French and Arabic...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_14.jpg)
I think that 'danger de mort' might mean 'danger of death'.
It's written twice...
I ask Manos - who has passable French - what it says.
“It doesn't say that we can't do it...”
Well, that’ll do, I guess.
---
*What an arrival...*
It’s *immense.*
The bloody thing just goes and goes and goes.
Iron ore containers shrink off to a vanishing point in *both* directions.
They're not what you think of when you think of train carriages; they're not *boxcars*. It's just a container to hold dirt. That's it... 
Finally, the never-ending procession comes screaming to a halt.
*Pick a container. Any container.*
A handful of locals start furiously loading the carriages with food and drinks and basically anything that they can sell at the mines. Enterprising mob...
We pick a random car - they're all as good as each other - when police show up...
*Shit.*
They're honking their horn at us, gesturing wildly at us to come to them. *Immediately.*
*Fuck.*
The three of us sheepishly head over to the cop car - *sprung.*
They're not making any sense to us, not even to Manos, but they're gesturing over to another carriage, as if to say *"look!"*
What's going on??
We follow their gaze to a carriage further down the line. It's being loaded with *mattresses.*
Oh. You bloody ripper!
This is a *massive* bonus.
Huge.
*Colossal.*
From rough as guts to a bed of roses.
*This is a fucking coup.*
We sprint to the carriage and jump aboard.
The mattresses are stacked level with the top of the container walls, so we’ll be able to sit on top of them and watch the Sahara roll by. There are three stacks. One each.
*It’s fucking perfect.*
The capitalists are still furiously loading the crap into the containers, and they’ve got a *pile* of shit to go, so Manos jumps out of the carriage to take some photos while Ben and I keep exploring the new home.
---
*What’s that... noise?*
It's a long way off, but it's getting louder...
"Hey, Ben, do you hear that?"
We both go quiet, it's getting *closer*, and *louder*. Like someone's letting off *bombs...*
We both look up the line of carriages, where the banging is coming from...
It's coming this way - *fast.*
Louder and closer.
Till it's a *roar*.
*It's coming right for us.*
"FUUUUUCK.. *BEN..!!*"
*Engage sphincter.*
Bang bang *BANG* BOOOOM!!!!
I shit my pants as the world moves under my feet and the carriage lurches into motion.
"What the actual *FUCK* Ben!?"
The banging and crashing echoes down the train, Doppler style.
*"Manos!"*
Ben and I pounce on the side of the carriage.
Manos is *flying.*
You’ve never seen anyone move so fast...
Ben and I scream jump and wave. *Adrenaline.*
*We have all of his shit...*
Manos jumps onto the side of the moving carriage like a fucking stunt double.
We’re away.
*No going back now.*

## Chapter Thirteen
*Dust.*
All of the leftover iron ore from every carriage in front of us is going airborne.
We’re moving fast enough that the wind whistles in the ears.
It’s like being *sandblasted.*
The air is *thick* with it, and there's nowhere to escape.
We each have a unique way of solving the problem. Manos pulls out a thick, black, woollen surgeons mask. I'll be fucked if I know where he got that from... I'm fuckin jealous.
To cover his eyes he borrows my aviator sunnies. He looks like he could be a new *Mortal Kombat* character, half *Scorpion*, half *Johnny Cage.*
*Flawless victory.*
Ben expertly uses a spare t-shirt like a Tuareg’s head-wrap. He looks like the *Dakar Rally* logo... He looks like a terrorist... He looks like he's done this before...
He's done such a good job that he's only got a slit left for his eyes, which he covers with his sunnies.
Desert Storm.
Uber badass.
I take my bandana that I usually wear inside my helmet and wrap it across my mouth and nose like a train robber from an old Western movie.
Not so badass... But the train robber bit is topical at least. *I look the part.*
We’re *pinging* on the awesomeness of just being here.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_15.jpg)
We start doing dumb shit with lots of energy...
Ben starts 'surfing' on the mattresses. Standing up. The carriages are swinging and bouncing all over the shop, but he’s making it look pretty easy. Monkey-see monkey-do, as Manos gets up there to give it a crack.
He almost immediately comes a gutser, very fucking close to going over the edge. His sphincter won't unlock for a few hours, I reckon...
Me?
*Fuck that.*
Mum would never forgive me if I died trainsurfing the Sahara Desert...
---
Our giddy enthusiasm lasts for a few hours.
We calm down, and settle in for the long haul.
It's just us and the dunes of the Sahara.
The sun’s slowly making its way to the undulating horizon. Through the thick dust cloud I can stare right at it without hurting my eyes. Kind of like wearing a welders mask.
I've never noticed it before, because I've never been able to look right at it like this - without the glare and brightness - but the sun is just a clear, round orb.
It's bloody *huge.*
The odd thought occurs to me that we’re orbiting around this monstrous ball of fusing hydrogen - right now - just obliviously hurtling around it.
And I get that 'infinitesimally small' feeling that I get when I look up at the stars in the night sky for long enough. *Existential crisis territory.*
But this is in the broad daylight, in the middle of the Sahara, on an iron ore train... It makes me feel insignificant and puny in the most *fantastic* way. Like it doesn't matter what I do, *ever,* the universe just doesn’t give a shit. Will *never* give a shit.
Couldn’t care less.
It’s a strange notion that I find empowering. It’s a wonderful justification to do just about anything... Just like this. *Case in point.*
If the universe doesn’t give a flying fuck, then why should I?
The sun sets...
---
Things get dark, and chilly. *Fast.*
Dinner time.
We chow down the food that we brought along: A couple of baguettes and some liquid cheese that I swear will outlast the apocalypse. Christ knows what’s in that garbage...
Half of what we eat is food. The other half is dust...
A local bloke comes along, he's been jumping between the carriages. Fucking *maniac.*
He gives us some oranges. Bonus. We love this guy.
We lay out on the mattresses and stare up at the canvas of stars through the dust, for the long, long ride.
---
Time stretches out.
The dust seems to get even worse, if that’s possible. Flash photography won’t work anymore; it’s just a whiteout of lit-up dust.
Imagine someone throwing a fistful of talcum powder into your face - point blank - every ten seconds, with your eyes and mouth open...
Tear ducts are in overdrive to try and keep the eyes clear.
Balls of mud made up of tears and dust had formed up on the sides of my eyes. The gunk is about the size of a ball bearing. *That can’t be good for ya...*
The three of us try to get some sleep, but that's going to be complicated. For one, we have to get off the train at a place called Choum, which isn't the last stop, so we don't want to sleep through it... Second, every time the train accelerates or decelerates, stops or starts, it makes that crescendo of terrifying banging as the carriages either smash together or smash apart, just like it did at the very start.
It happens *all the time.*
Even though I can hear it coming a mile away (literally) it still makes me shit my pants as it comes smashing through our carriage. *It's that loud.*
We make a game of screaming *“INCOMING!!”* every time we hear it start up at the front, like we're in a fucking war movie.
While we're trying to sleep, our mate with the oranges brings us blankets, he even tucks us in.
Seriously, love that guy...
---
I'm getting delirious.
It must be somewhere *near* dawn...
A long time ago things changed from being an adventure into being a grind... The senses have been almost constantly assaulted, barely without respite.
The train has been stopped in the middle of the desert for an inordinate amount of time. *What could they possibly be doing??*.
I sit up and look around. Fuck all...
A random guy walks past. I pop the question.
"Choum?"
"*Bar bar* Choum"
*"Choum?!?"*
"Wee"
I raise the alarm. We scramble.
Chucking our shit over the edge onto the sand and jumping out before the train takes us to the fucking mines...
*It's over.*
The train leaves, and there's an eerie silence in the dark...
Was there a plan for this?
---
I come to...
I'm being *squashed*. In a car. Full of *black people.*
*Panic.*
I start making panicked noise... then it all comes back to me in a rush.
*I remember getting in this car...*
I'm in the Sahara Desert. It's ok...
I calm my smashing heart and try to remember what's going on in my half-sleep. There's, how many... *nine blokes* in the cab of the ute. I remember one bloke sitting on top of the huge pile of dried fish on the back, so that makes ten. I wouldn't be surprised if I was dreaming of being a sardine, the image is perfect, but the man who's sitting on me has got his armpit right up my nose, so that's covering the smell. I don't know what's worse; this bloke smells like he's never had a shower in his life... He probably hasn't...
*We've been lucky.*
If they weren't in Choum, well, we'd be in the shit...
Head on window. Desert sands. *Fade to black.*

## Chapter Fourteen
*Atar.*
Sun's rising.
That makes it - since yesterday lunchtime - about eighteen hours from door to door.
Solid.
And people complain about taking an eighteen hour flight...
We check into a cheap hotel and take turns showering off the dust.
I sleep like a dead man.
---
Atar, it turns out, is a bit of a rubbish tip; like Nouadhibou, but in a weird way it's almost interestingly *grimey*; the colour and vibrancy of the vegetables at the market, side by side with big racks of meat covered in flies. And all the *noise...* It makes for compelling viewing.
It still *feels* like the Middle East. It's not at all what I expected from Africa.
I pay for breakfast/lunch with the last of my money. I'm not *smart* when it comes to this shit, and I haven't planned for what might happen if I can't get money; there's no wad of US dollars in a secret pocket somewhere. As soon as my credit card stopped working the cash dried up. *Fast.*
Ben's broke too.
I don't think Manos ever had any money...
Ben and I spend the afternoon seeking out cash machines. We're lucky that they even have them here, in this tiny town in the middle of nowhere. Not that they're any fucking use to me; I'm rejected, every time.
Ben's rejected, every time, *despite having a Visa card.*
Aaaand - we're - fucked.
Frustrating. *Scary.*
Frustrating, because I know there's fucking money there, a bloody bucket of the stuff, but I can't get at it. Scary, because what fucking happens now? I could get money wired to me from my family... But then, where to collect?
How do I manage food, accommodation and transport with no money?
The only thing I can do is rely on the kindness of strangers...
*Dirt poor strangers.*
It's *heinously* unfair.
---
Back to the hotel (just how, *exactly,* am I going to pay for that..?) and on the way, there's another cash machine that we missed.
It's *ancient.* Unlikely.
I try.
Fucking rejected.
Ben tries.
It looks like his card's been swallowed...
Now we've got to fucking sort *that* out.
*God fucking damn it.*
*Crunch-crunch-crunch-crunch-crunch...*
*Wait...!*
The cash machine opens its mouth spits out a *fat* wad of notes.
Saved!! Fucking *saved!*
Beautiful 'ouguiya'. Best currency in the world.
*Thank fuck for that...*
Ben even gets his card back.
Shit yeah. And *breathe.*
Well, I'll be fucked if I'm doing that again...
Ben lends me 10,000 ouguiya - he seems the opposite of impressed about it.
It's about forty bucks worth. It should be able to get me through four days worth out here in the desert, if I'm guessing right. Mauritania is cheap as chips...
---
I head to the 'cyber' and get my shit in a pile.
It's like pulling teeth with the shithouse connection, but I manage to apply for a new credit card back in Australia. Would've taken five minutes to do back home. Here: five hours. Shit, I might have accidentally applied for *ten* cards with all those timeouts. Who knows if they worked or not...
In many ways it's scary just how *easy* it was. Here I am, in Mauritanian Sahara, half a world away, and I can apply for a credit card. Crazy, really. And a little dodgy.
I get it sent to my parents address. When they get it they'll have to forward it on to wherever I am.
In the meantime, I send my dad a secret email and a secret $500 for him to wire to me here in Mauritania. Apparently, I can't wire it to myself; that's called 'money laundering'.
While I'm at it, I send Dad a 'break in case of emergency' pile of money so he can just forward it to me if I end up in the shit again.
It's going to be ok...

## Chapter Fifteen 
*Chinguetti.*
Dunes as far as the eye can see.
The Sahara is *exactly* how you’d imagine it, just bigger, and not as hot.
Ben fell in love with the place immediately. His enthusiasm brought us all along for the ride; I love it a bit too.
It's an ancient, semi-ruined half-village-half-city.
The whole place is built out of rocks that look like they've been stacked exactly how they came out of the ground. The whole village is just shades of the colour 'sand'.
It's beautiful.
And empty.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_16.jpg)
As we walk through the ancient city, we pick up kids on the way like the *Pied Piper*. They get so excited to see us that they start chanting some tribal war shit, and belting the snot out of each other with big steel *re-bars,* as if for our entertainment...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_17.jpg)
We shake them off and, together, we roam the Sahara, because we can.
Camels and sand...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_18.jpg)
---
*Mosquitos.*
My god, the mosquitos...
*Swarms.*
A fucking *armada.*
I've never seen anything like it...
I have my sleeping bag zipped all the way to the top, and the strap pulled so tight that all you can see are my lips.
*I'm still being eaten alive.*
So - incredibly - *itchy.*
And the *noise.*
It's like the Flight of the Valkyries.
There are so many of them that it becomes a *hum*, but I can still pick out the sound of the one closest to my ear...
*That iconic noise...*
Sleep?
*Impossible.*
---
Bleary eyed as the sun rises and the mozzies retreat, we jump another 'bush taxi'.
I look like I've got a bad case of *chicken pox.* The fuckers have eaten my face.
Each one could be carrying malaria...
A few hours of nothing but Sahara on a lonely dirt road, and then...
*Ouadane.* Pronounced "wa-darn".
*Magnificent.*
It looks like something out of the poem *Ozymandias.*
'...round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away...'
It looks like giant wasp nest from a distance. A *colossal wreck* up close.
When I first spotted it I thought it was something *natural*, like a mountain.
*What a city this must have been...*
Shit. There must a billion rocks in there.
In the same design as Chinguetti, but *massive.*
And empty...
The vast majority of the city is just rocks. There are only a few small pockets in the middle where a handful of people still live.
---
While we're exploring and looking for food (and not having much luck at that...) a young kid, a teenager, comes sprinting up to us.
"Hello!!"
I've no trust for anyone who wants to talk to me, ever...
He's wearing the traditional get-up of the 'Berbers'. It's pretty awesome, really, like a double shouldered robe, like a Muslim *Sub-Zero.* Impractical, no doubt. Pretty pimp though..
"Hi."
"*Hello!!!* Can I speak English with you?"
"Sure..."
So we talk...
The kid, turns out, is something of a genius. A prodigy.
His name is Mohammed, like everyone else here.
He's never left Ouadane. *Not in his entire life.*
He's never even been the couple of hours down the road to Chinguetti, *never seen it.*
He has spent his entire life, isolated, in this ruinous village.
He speaks *perfect* English.
Bang on.
He's been learning what he can from the very occasional traveller, just like he's doing with us.
We might as well have been Santa Claus to this kid. *He is so eager to learn.*
You've never seen a bigger, more genuine smile.
It never leaves his face.
Happier than a pig in shit.
He's *delighted* when we accept his offer to have lunch at his house with his family.
---
We step through a metal door and into the courtyard. The first thing that grabs my attention is something *alive* hanging from the clothes line.
*What is that??*
I walk closer. Is that a, *beehive??*
No. It's a writhing ball of flies.
*Fuck.*
Are they all, fucking??
They're going nuts... *What are they doing??*
I swish them away - with difficulty - to reveal a piece of meat the size of a fist underneath. Like a tennis ball in a stocking.
Ree-pulsive.
Must be 'out to dry'...
I push back the bile and head inside with everyone else.
---
We eat.
No points for guessing what...
I don't even care, I'm too busy making eyes at Mo's sister...
Hands down the most beautiful woman I've seen in a long, long time.
*Sweet baby Cheeses...* I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like her...
Once we're finished with lunch (which was, actually, *really* good) she starts to do her prayers.
And it's too much for me. She might as well be doing yoga in activewear...
I reckon Manos and Ben are having the same dilemma...
Anyway. Mo hasn't stopped talking.
He's actually a really good kid... A *really* good kid...
I feel for him.
Imagine that much intelligence, stuck in a place so isolated.
I want to adopt him, take him with us on the journey, and show him everything that he's never seen before.
"Luke, can I ask you something?"
"Mate, I keep telling you, you don't have to ask permission. Go for it."
"Ok. Thank you. Are there really diamonds in the sky?"
"Diamonds in the sky? No... What do you mean mate?"
"Rihanna, she says that they are *diamonds in the sky.* Is that true? Are they *really* diamonds?"
"*What!?* Wait... How do you know about *Rihanna?*"
He's chuffed. "I have the music, other travellers gave it to me. Oh! Do you like Justin Bieber??"
*Unbelievable.*
This poor kid needs a role model.
He's crestfallen as I chastise him for his taste in music, and drum home the point that he can never, ever, *under any circumstances,* believe anything he hears in a song from any pop artist, ever.
"What's 'pop'?"
"Never mind mate. If you like I can give you some new music, how does that sound"
"Yes! Good!"
We head back out as the sun sets.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_19.jpg)
---
It's a shame, but these kinds of places, incredible as they are, don't really have any *staying power.* Once you've seen them, that's kind of it...
So, we've gotta go... I feel like I'm abandoning Mo...
We hitch a ride in the tray of a ute back to Atar. It rains, and it's cold enough to wear my only jumper. I still can't believe it, rain in the Sahara...
In Atar we hitch another ride the long, long drive to the capital on the coast, Nouakchott.
Seven hours of driving. I'm still not done...
I've gotta get back to Nouadhibou, where the Enfield is...
That's another six hours, with many time-outs for prayer to add in.
At least the road is good...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_20.jpg)
---
Success!
The Enfield, somewhat miraculously, is *exactly* where I left it.
Now. Back to Nouakchott.
Cue eight hours.
Eight hours at eighty clicks per hour.
Eight brain-deadening hours of re-tracing my footsteps through absolutely fuck-all for the second time in two days.
That's the kind of distance that I'd normally chop in two, but the only thing, *the only thing*, between the two cities is five hundred clicks of road and a petrol station.
*Vie de merde,* as the French say: Life of shit.
Delirious, at the end of my tether, I re-join Ben and Manos in Nouakchott, and collapse.
---
It's not a particularly likeable place, Nouakchott, but I like it anyway. Grimey and interesting, yet liveable. I think it's also that, to me, it feels exotic, or, at least, the path less travelled. After Morocco it's been nothing short of refreshing; no one gives me the shits here. I haven't been harassed *once.*
I've been busy.
Even though I could have easily gone back to the border post again and renewed my LP for another ten days, that wasn't an experience I wanted to repeat, so I headed to the Douanes in Nouakchott instead.
Took me a morning to find them... Fucking impossible to find a place with zero fucking French skills.
Once there, I got the feeling that they didn't really want to help me out, so I just stayed in their faces and outlasted them for patience; I'm getting better at this waiting game... *Success.*
The three of us have managed to pick up visas for Senegal at their embassy. Not easy, but certainly not what you'd call complex. Just lots of hoops to jump through, but each jump is relatively painless; stuff like having to have two passport sized photos handy, and having a letter of invitation ready (which is easily forged). Stuff like that. *Success.*
Another one. *The money's come through.* And it wasn't an ordeal to pick it up either. $500 when you convert it to the local currency is a *fuckload* of cash. Fat stacks. I'm flush again. *Success.*
It's time to move on...

## Chapter Sixteen
Manos isn't done with his new couchsurfing friend yet, so we plan to tee up again in Senegal.
Ben and I have been *foaming* for Senegal for weeks; we've met a few old travellers on the way south, who have said something along the lines of "Oh, you lucky bastards! To be young and in Senegal again..!" as they gaze wistfully off into the distance of better times in their youth.
*Sounds good to us.*
The trouble is that I don't really know how to get in...
On the map there are three ways, only two of which are potentials: Through the inland post at Rosso, or the more remote coastal post at Diama.
*Rosso's the big one.* It's got a reputation for being worse than a clusterfuck. A reputation for being one of the toughest, most corrupt borders on the planet.
*Fuck that.*
Diama, we don't really know anything about it.
It's a black box. An unknown.
But, give me a turd in one hand and a black box in the other, I'll eat what's in the box.
In any case, there's two hundred clicks to travel till the roads branch.
*Better get to it.*
---
The road is epic.
Epically *shit.*
Fuck me. What happened to all the good tarmac??
This is just a hodgepodge of awful, *truly awful* 'tarmac'.
There are potholes I could park the bike in...
We have to constantly weave to avoid them. I've got to be sharp, every moment.
It's impossible to get up any speed, or else risk going over the handlebars.
Despite playing it safe, I hit them, all the time. They're deep enough to bottom out the suspension on the Enfield completely, and we land with a bang. Not good for the bike. Not good for my spine...
*Two hundred clicks.*
Downright fucking dangerous.
With the morning completely spent - and then some - we make the turnoff to Diama.
And not a moment too soon; I don't reckon the bike could have handled much more of that...
What's worse, is that the little oil leak that the Enfield picked up back in France has turned into a *haemorrhage.*
No oil = dead Enfield.
What can I do about it? *Fuck all.*
On to Diama.
---
It's not worse... Just *different.*
Soft sand; tricky. Or, corrugated, hard-dried clay; tooth shattering.
It's either fluky, or bone jarring.
I'm *shattered.*
*This is hard work.*
The rear indicators have fallen off the Enfield. That's how bad it is.
One of the mirrors let go too. Needed to stop to tighten the screws.
It's like being in a paint mixer, or sitting on a jackhammer.
It's a grind that's taking *hours.*
In the soft sand it's just *scary.* Two heavy people on a heavy bike with skinny tyres plus soft sand is a recipe for a *bin.*
I *should* be going faster, to 'skim' over the top instead of getting the tyres bogged down, but I dare not.
My knuckles are white. I *wrestle* with the bike.
I'm riding the clutch *constantly* to try and keep some control over my speed. It must be fucking *fried* by now.... But, I guess that's better than having a prang, right?
Where the oil was leaking - in where the chain disappears under the engine cover - it's just a muddy mess now.
*I'm not happy with that...*
What's worse is that when I stop to check the oil level I can't *see* anything in the sight glass (no dipsticks on this bike...)
That either means it's hiding somewhere else, or it's all come out and the sump is dry...
There's *no one* out here to help us.
We're well and truly off the grid.
But, looking on the bright side, *we're out of the desert.*
Things went green in the blink of an eye. There are even *warthogs,* which is new... Wetlands, and a fuckload of exotic birds.
I can almost *smell* the malaria... The air's gone from bone-dry to wet and heavy.
We've seen fuck all in the way of 'civilisation' all day, and the sun's getting low...
---
*Diama.*
After eight hours in the saddle, and with no lunch, this is the last thing I want to be doing.
*No choice.*
*Here we go.*
I still don’t really know what I’m doing, I haven’t figured it out yet; I’m still worried I’m going to get my pants pulled down... At this time of the day, and this far out of the way, they have all the power; there’s not much I can do other than hope they’re good, honest people...
I slap a smile on my face, puff my chest out, and try to have the right, carefree attitude I ought to have.
I must look like I’ve stepped in a pile shit and I'm trying to look pleased about it...
Looking around, the post is simple enough.
There are three demountable buildings and a boom gate at the end. This mob obviously don’t get anywhere near the traffic that they do in the north; we’re the only ones here.
We head into the first building: Gendarmerie. I'm getting the inkling that, as far as border crossings go, they're not particularly important; at least not a show-stopper...
Handshakes all round. Everyone’s all smiles.
There are two 'officials'. They want a 'Fish'. Not a *fish* fish, but a Fish. It's a French word, pronounced “feeesh” dunno how to spell it... Anyway, it's something you write yourself, a piece of paper with your 'details' written down. Like a cheat-sheet. Ben and I have been giving them out like candy at the squillions of checkpoints along the road. Ben's fresh out of Fish... At the last checkpoint on the way here they *insisted* on a Fish, so Ben wrote one up, on the spot, with the address 'Bag End, Hobbiton'. He can be an idiot sometimes. Hilarious, but an idiot. Can you imagine if the guy had read the Lord of the Rings??
Anyway, Ben tells the border officials that he doesn't have any 'feeeesh' left.
They *lose* it.
I mean *really* go off the handle.
*Pissing* themselves laughing.
Ben and I share a look...
They're in *tears.*
In the end, we're laughing at them laughing - how can we not? We're deliriously tired, and the laughter is infectious.
Laughing my head off with Mauritanian Gendarmes.
How did life come to this?
If the rest of the border is going to be this laid back it's gonna be a deadset cakewalk...
The officials compose themselves - still giggling - and take down Ben's basic details.
Handshakes all round, and we’re on to the Douanes.
Ben's sitting this one out.
*Envious.*
I step in the door and it's immediately obvious that this mob don’t have the same sense of humour as the Gendarmes... There are about five or six of them in uniform playing cards on the floor.
I've obviously interrupted them. *They're not impressed.*
I’m big smiles and handshakes all round.
The reception I get is *frosty.*
I’m the only one here so I get to deal with the top man. He’s got a hard head and looks mildly pissed off. Must've been a good hand... He ushers me into his office and we sit down at his desk.
He fingers through my passport and my rego papers.
“Now you give me ten euro.”
Red flag...
"Por-qwaar?"
Apparently, it’s for taking the motorbike out of the country. I explain that I don’t have euros and he says that 4,000 ouguiya will be fine...
*I smell a rat;* I don’t remember ever giving anyone money to get a bike *out* of a country.
In, yes.
Out, no.
And ten euros out here is a bucketload of cash...
I tell him I’m not going to pay it unless I can get a *receipt* for it (I’ve read, somewhere, that this is a good ploy to avoid paying frivolous bribes masked as 'legitimate' payments). As a cherry on top I ask him what his name is and, while I'm laying it on with a trowel, I ask him what his bosses name is too...
It doesn't go down well. *At all.*
He goes *wild.*
He stands up, nearly knocking his chair over, and tells me that if I don’t like it I can go the eight hours back to Nouakchott - finger pointing and all.
Almost spat it at me...
*Touché.*
I leave the shack without my papers and go and talk with the *other* Douane, who’s having a friendly chat with Ben outside.
I try and tactfully weasel out of him whether or not I need to pay...
He just shrugs his shoulders...
Ben’s got no idea either, he's done this as many times as I have...
Ben - to his credit - doesn’t suggest I do anything either way.
If I was in his shoes - starving and tired - I'd be saying pay the man and fucking get on with it, *for fucks sake...*
He’s just happy to sit and be.
He's a better man than I am...
I head back in for round two.
It lasts fifteen minutes. I defend with my language barrier, and then jab with my 'por-qwarr?'
It’s like trying to learn a new dance when you don’t know the steps; you’re going to tread on some toes.
I’m about to cave. *It really is too late in the day for this...*
But *he blinks first,* and says that I can take the motorbike out of the country for 4,000 ouguiya *with* a receipt, *or* I can have it for 2,000 ouguiya *without* a receipt.
*Bang.* Now I *know* it's bullshit.
Tasting blood in the water, I *pile* it on, *demanding* that he stamps my papers and lets me out of the country for *nothing.*
*As he fucking should...*
The hard-nosed prick won’t budge though; he’s still seething angry.
With the fresh shot of indignation I manage to bitch and moan and argue for another fifteen minutes.
He’s having *none* of it.
We're going in circles again...
*I cave.* Principles be damned... I chalk it up as a half-win at half-price, and I reckon he does too. *I feel like I'm learning.*
He hand writes something illegible in my passport, stamps it, and that’s that.
*Moving on.*
I grab Ben’s passport (he stays put) and head to Immigration.
The post official is a squat, chubby fella with a moustache. His appearance makes him seem like a nice guy, like a big teddy bear. Thoroughly harmless.
His fat fingers flip through the passports.
He wants to see registration papers for the bike.
He wants to see insurance for the bike.
He wants to see the laissez-passer for the bike.
He wants to see a license for the bike.
He’s *Immigration* for fuck's sake - My bike is *not* immigrating out of Mauritania - it can't, *it's not a human...*
The bike is none of his business... I think...
He’s probably trying to trip me up, find holes, catch me out, but he's not getting it... This peanut can't see the woods from the trees: Invalid insurance; no international drivers license; no carnet de passage, and he can’t find anything to put me over the barrel for... *Thick in the head.*
All I need from this guy is an 'exit stamp' in the passports.
Fun fact: In French, an ink stamp is called a 'tampon'.
Go figure...
It's the only time I've ever had to ask another bloke to 'give me a tampon'...
Anyway, my thick peanut butter moustachioed teddy bear post official has run out of ammunition, and proceeds to tampon both our passports. He hands them back to me with all my papers.
"Now you give me ten euros..."
*Ha!*
What a fucking *stooge.* This guy needs to take lessons from the bloke at Customs next door; the *moment* he handed those stamped passports back to me he lost all leverage.
Shit, even *I* know that!!
I tell him that I have to go and give my friend back his passport, and he accepts this as a fair excuse to leave the building.
He just watches from the doorframe, helpless, as Ben and I kit up and jump on the bike. As I hit the ignition I make eye contact with Peanut, who waves me to come back inside. I wave back, and we ride off.
---
This is the side of the two borders that gives me the willies. Ten euros will seem like fuck all if their reputation is to be believed...
Will the black box have another turd in it?
Riding up on the bike I’m already having a win; what freaked me out most about our last border was how big and busy, frenetic and confusing it was. Out here, now, there’s none of that madness; just three, simple, small shacks.
We’ve gone through the shit to get here - four extra hours of difficult, dead-arse riding that we didn’t have to do, and now we get to reap the reward.
Even before I turn the key off we get mobbed by a small posse of fixers, money changers, and people flogging useless shit.
Because we’re the only ones at the post we come in for a fair whack of attention.
We brush them off as best we can and head to one of the buildings, which turns out to be half Police, half Immigration.
Behind a steel-barred 'window' is one fat fuck in uniform, sitting at a desk, surrounded by stacks of papers and stamps. He looks like he’s stuck in a prison cell...
We hand him our passports, he fingers through them and - without a word - tampons our entry stamps in.
Piece of fucking cake. *We're in.*
He casually puts the passports down on his desk, leans back in his chair and slowly, leisurely puts his feet up. With a self-satisfied, smug smile on his face he says something in French that has the word “euros” in it.
*Bastard...*
I explain that we don’t know *any* French, even though Ben’s got a half-decent handle on it...
“You give ten euros, you give me *money.*”
Well, he’s got the passports - he’s got the power.
In a way I’m almost *relieved*, I was expecting way, *way* worse than ten euros as a starting point. So that's as bad as it can get... Not bad...
I look to Ben. He can take this one.
“Dis euro? Por-qwar?”
“Service fee.”
“*Service fee??* Por-qwar?”
“You pay because you late. After 'dis-wheat' hour (Dis-wheat is eighteen, so, 6pm) everyone pay dis euro. You give me ten euros.”
Ben and I exchange looks with scrunched up faces and a bit of a sly grin.
We check our watches.
It’s 5:45pm. *He’s 15 minutes off...*
Ben and I are grinning like idiots at each other.
I point this dickhead to the time on my watch. “Ce dis *set* currant-sank... hmmm?”.
He looks confused, then looks at his own watch, then looks angry.
He grabs our passports and *slams* them down under the hole in the iron-bars.
Fuck yes!! *Victory!*
We walk away laughing our heads off.
The entry stamps mean that Ben and I are now clear to enter the country, but I still need to get papers from Customs for the bike before we can ride out.
I tell Ben to hold the fort while I go and sort out a laissez-passer.
The Douanes is different set-up; small window, so I knock on the door and step inside.
There are three guns hanging on the wall opposite the door, and a small TV playing a music channel that's half static above my head.
There’s only one guy in the room, sitting at a desk.
He’s *ginormous.*
A fucking *beast* of a man, with boots up on the desk and his hands behind his head while he watches the TV.
He gets up...
Maybe only a shade taller than me, but he looks as strong as a fucking ox.
He looks like he’s about to *explode* out of his t-shirt.
It’s handshakes and smiles as I go through the usual explanations: I don’t speak French, do you speak English? Can I get a laissez-passer. Ok? Yes, good...
We make some small talk in broken English while he checks my bike rego and writes up the LP.
It’s all very jovial and good natured. Friendly. The gentle giant.
Thank Christ for that. I wouldn't want to see this bloke crack the shits...
All done and finished, he hands me back all my papers and a completed and stamped LP.
Fucking *beautiful.*
While we’re still talking and laughing I shove the papers into the inner pocket of my jacket, and zip it all the way to my neck.
"Now you give me ten euros..."
*Fuck.*
'Euros' are my new red flag; I *know* it's a total load of shit.
I tell him that I don’t *have* any euros, and I’m *not* paying it. I go to leave, and open the door about a quarter of the way.
He stops the door with his huge hand and *slams* it shut while I'm still gripping the handle.
*He locks the door.*
*Shit...*
He’s the *opposite* of happy.
“*No!* You pay! You give me money. *Now!*”
It's like being yelled at by a fucking walrus.
I’m distinctly aware of the guns on the wall and on his arms. The ones on the wall look like the AK-47’s meaner big brother... I’m not sure which ones I’m more scared of; this guy looks like he's about to turn into the black Incredible Hulk...
I'm *full* of adrenaline. *Fizzing*.
Everything's going *fuzzy,* in my eyes and in my head it's like a whacked out dreamland.
Despite the nugget in the back of my pants I stick to my guns and tell him I’m not paying for it. I go over the usual shtick.
He’s furious like *I’m* the one cheating *him*. He’s grabbed my arm like Popeye grabbing a tin of spinach. *Squeezing.*
“You pay or you give paper back! *NOW!!*”
He’s trying to get into my jacket, and I'm trying to stop him.
In the wrestle (that I'm actually winning, he can't get at the zip...) the notepad of LP's on his desk catches my attention.
I can see scrawled on it *'2,500 CFA'*.
2,500 Central African Francs.
I do quick and dirty math and realise it’s only about five bucks...
I point it out to him.
That *really* pisses him off.
I tell him that that’s all I’ll pay and that I don’t have *any* money, *but my friend does.* I just want him to unlock that fucking door so I can get out...
There's a mob forming outside the dirty, smeared window...
My captor’s sticking to his guns but he’s taken the bait about Ben having all the money. He unlocks the door and tells one of the gathered mob to go and fetch him. Ben comes and stands in the doorway and, as always, he’s ice cold.
*The Iceman.*
Despite the yelling he seems utterly nonplussed by it all. Bored, again.
I bet I looked fucking *frantic* in comparison.
Ben's changed money with the fixers while he waited for me, so he's got some Francs. He’s only got it in denominations of a thousand, so he gives me three notes.
I chuck the 3,000 CFA onto the desk like it's a smokebomb, like a squid shooting ink.
As I do, a short, squat, older guy in uniform pushes past the fixers and comes into the room. He makes no introductions...
*He looks like the boss...*
My gigantor friend bellows “you leave now!!” and shoves us both out the door.
I’m not about to ask for change...
*Victory number two!* Kind of...
We’re *done* here.
On the bike and onwards into Senegal.
It's nothing but glorious, fresh tarmac.

## Chapter Seventeen
*Senegal.*
Now *this* is *Africa!*
*Green.*
Colourful, patterned dresses with big headscarves.
Carrying stuff on their heads.
Babies in a sling.
*Proper* Africa.
We roll into St. Louis, which is a big scummy beachside shanty town in the very north of the country.
It’s messy in places but it’s got its own charm to it, I guess. It used to be the capital, so it’s full of old derelict French colonial buildings from the 'glory days'.
We shack up in a cheap 'auberge', which is French for hostel.
I reckon we’re the only ones here...
It’s late, and immediately our minds are on food. It’s been a long, tough day and we haven’t eaten since omelettes and croissants for breakfast this morning.
We’re *ravenous.*
Surprisingly, we manage to find a fairly modern, western, diner-ish style place in town.
Burgers and chips. Of course...
They come out to us and they're *massive* and *greasy* and filled with everything they had in the kitchen; beef, eggs, chips, tonnes of salad, all swimming in sauce.
Too big to fit your mouth around...
Two bucks a pop. Yep, *two dollars.*
It’s just what the doctor ordered, so we each order two.
They disappear in quick succession and the two zombies are starting to rise again like Lazarus.
We polish the feast down with a couple of the local brews, the first drinks since Tony left off with his beer and rum in Nouadhibou.
We’re both fucking *thrilled* to be in Senegal.
The 'real' Africa.
*Life is good.*
---
*Delirious.* Utterly exhausted.
Vaguely nauseous.
A stonking headache.
I can't stop *sweating.*
But it’s not hot...
Half-awake, half-asleep, tossing and turning in restlessness that stays for hours. I can't shake it.
It must be nearly sunrise...
My brain is flying all over the place from one strange thought after the next. It won’t *settle*. It won't let me sleep.
I'm *crushingly* tired.
Fucking awful.
One clear thought is coming through, over and over again: *Malaria.*
Symptoms for malaria include fever (tick), headache (tick), chills (nope), sweats (tick), fatigue (tick), nausea (half-a-tick), vomiting (nope). Death (nope).
*Can’t forget death...*
I know this because Ben's had it. Got it in East Africa.
He said it was “curious to feel what it would feel like to be dying”.
Joy of joys.
Malaria moves fast... And - just for fun - if it's not treated early enough, and the malaria multiplies past some certain 'critical amount', you’re basically fucked; there’s nothing medicine can do to bring it back under control and you end up, eventually, slowly, dead.
I can explain the fatigue, but the rest? No.
I’m waiting for the shakes and chills to confirm it, and then I'm fucking off to hospital.
I’m *shattered.*
Without warning, my guts turns into a puddle.
*Whoosh.*
I violently shit my entire body weight through the eye of a needle.
I *did* make it to the toilet.
*Barely...*
---
I shit more than I thought I could possibly have in me... And then more again.
I beat a path between my bed and the toilet for the whole morning till midday.
After holding out for twelve hours, I can't do it anymore; I give in to my bloated nausea, head to the can, and throw up. *Hard.*
One of those chunders that seems to break the laws of physics because the diameter of it looks like the size of your head as it’s coming flying out at a clip.
An *enormous* volume of vomit.
Despite sitting in my guts for the whole night and the whole morning, the two burgers haven’t digested one bit.
There's something odd about that...
*I need to chew more...*
By the time I’m done the only thing hurting anymore are my stomach muscles from being wrung dry like a wet towel.
I feel like hell, but it’s an improvement.
I crash back into bed, and, *somehow,* sleep comes.
---
*To sit or to kneel?* That is the question...
*Three days* of asking the question.
What a life.
I can't say much about St. Louis, other than to give a disturbingly accurate description of the fittings and décor of the shitter...
I never had the courage to go out of spitting distance of the toilet, till now.
I wander back into the world like a man crippled.
Absolutely wracked.
Despite ticking the 'vomit box' for malaria symptoms, I never got the other two: chills and death. Apparently the chills are the dead giveaway, so it seems that I'm out of the woods on that one...
*Lucky but unlucky.*
Thank Christ for Ben. He kept me on a strict diet of bananas and bottled water. I don't know how I would have fed myself if I was alone... 

## Chapter Eighteen 
*Dakar.*
*The* Dakar.
A big, bustling city. One of the biggest in West Africa.
Perched on the very tip of the western bulge of the continent. You literally can’t get any further west without jumping on a boat.
Dakar is a *proper* city, with good roads, bridges, big buildings, supermarkets and all that jazz.
There’s always a *tonne* of traffic and the cars are all beat up piles of shit that spew thick black smoke. The pollution here is so bad that we can stare straight at the dimmed-out sun, no worries - just like in that dust storm in the Sahara.
I feel like a pack-a-day smoker...
There are pockets of modernity here, with some of the big name hotel chains setting up shop, but besides all that, it’s a touch old and decrepit and grimey; just how we like it.
I’m pretty sure most tourists don’t see much of Dakar other than the pool-side bar. Needless to say, Ben and I aren’t staying in those sorts of places. We settle for a shitty, double-room on a roof, with a big, gaping hole above the door where the air conditioner used to be.
*Cheap as chips.* The mosquitos come and go as they please...
Manos - the sly dog - has managed to find another house to stay at - for free. He also happens to be rooting his host... *Vamos Manos!*
We've spent three weeks loitering here, mostly just surfing. One time we found a washed up goats carcass on the shore... *Delightful.*
The food here is a heart attack. A uni-student's wet-dream: hot chip and sauce sandwich, in a baguette, with boiled eggs and heroin.
Fucking delicious, fucking addictive, and that's just for *breakfast*...
I've serviced the Enfield - which took a while to arrange - but time just happens to be something I've got a lot of here; the new credit card is yet to arrive...
The mechanics were awesome, they didn't mind me using their workshop, and they even let me share their lunch. Everyone eats out of the same big bowl - rice and fish and 'sauce'. No one seems to care that their hands are covered in black grease and shit...
The bike is spick-and-span after a much needed clean. I've glued the indicators back on and tightened up that mirror.
I've replaced the gasket where I reckon I'm having that that pesky oil leak. Fingers crossed on that one...
The air filter had more sand in it than a beach. *Suboptimal...*
Other than that, it was just a 'standard' service. Oil changes and other simple enough stuff, and she's ready to go again...
---
Christmas comes, and goes, and still we wait.
Skinny black Santa is *really* weird...
Christmas here is less about Jesus and more about fireworks. My kind of Christmas...
Poor Ben isn’t a fan.
He's an Afghanistan Veteran. He's seen war. He doesn't talk about it. He involuntarily shits his pants anytime someone lets off an especially large firework; which is roughly one an hour.
The poor bastard's been on a hair trigger all week, and goes into a half sprawl *every single time* something goes bang - he can't help it. I guess I'd shit my pants too...
---
*Finally.*
The new credit card has crossed the seas.
Getting it 'activated' from Senegal is a headache; the bank wants to do a bunch of security tests over the phone before I can use it... Some fun conversations there...
I throw some money into the new account and head out to test it on a cash machine.
It crunches the cash, first time. *Beautiful.*
I go and change what's left of my $500 worth of Ouguiya into US dollars. It’s a smart move to have an exchangeable currency and everyone's been doing it except me.
I take out enough cash in Senegalese money to top me up to a combined $1,000 worth and then go and make the exchange at a local shop. Fat stacks. *No dramas.*
I’m thrilled that that’s finally done, it's the last box to be ticked, and we can finally move on to somewhere new.
To celebrate Ben and I go surfing all day.
*What a life.*
---
I hit the shower to wash off a particularly soupy day in the ocean.
When I get back to the room, Ben’s complaining that he thinks his pocket music player got stolen.
"You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel..."
*He's not in the mood for a laugh.*
He’s got his bag emptied out on his bed and he’s rifling through all his clothes and pockets.
It's just a cheap, shitty little music player. Not worth a lot, and I have a little chuckle to myself that I’m not going to have to listen to him playing that shitty reggae anymore.
It's a win.
For Ben though, it's *devastating;* it’s rare for Ben not to have the headphones in, listening to music in his spare time - which is a lot of the time.
I offer my commiserations, but mostly I’m interested to see how this is all going to pan out with the staff at the hotel... Should be good sport.
He’s *frantically* checking, re-checking and re-checking his stuff again.
I notice that my leather bike jacket - which hasn’t moved from its spot on the table in weeks - has moved, just a smidge.
I go to it, and absentmindedly touch the pocket where I keep my GPS.
The pocket’s *flat...*
The zip's undone.
*Empty.*
Ohhhhhhh.
*Violated. Nausea.*
My head becomes so heavy it's going to roll off my shoulders.
*No no no no...*
My eyes bulge. I don’t blink. *I'm paralysed.*
In the mush of a thousand thoughts that fly all at once in the next second, there’s the thought that this is *just a mistake.*
*A misunderstanding.*
I thump my hand down onto the opposite front pocket.
*Flat.*
*That’s where I keep my camera...*
Fuck. Oh *fuck* no!
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!
I throw open my jacket. The inside pocket's unzipped. Wallet. Gone.
*Panic.*
*Someone's been in my jacket...!*
My license, my cash, my three credit cards, *my fucking just-activated credit card!!*
The grand... The thousand... Oh Jesus...
*I'm frozen again.*
Please please *please...*
I slam my hand on the super-secret pocket. *Flat.*
I open the pocket. *Nothing.*
*Cleaned out.*
My mind is a wild blur of a million thoughts and permutations of the past and the future. And the *crushing* present. It's all happening, all at once, and at light-speed.
Ben’s stopped what he's doing and has been watching me: Frenzied movement then freezing, another frenzied movement and then freezing again, with wounded-animal-noises in between.
He’s joined the dots that we’ve been *fucked,* and that I’ve copped it far worse than he has.
We share a look...
I make a dive at my saddlebags. Everything in my jacket that's been nicked can be replaced. It’ll be a bitch, but they’re not *irreplaceable.*
*All the irreplaceables are in my bags.*
Laptop with all my everything on it.
All my official bike papers.
My *passports.*
My bike keys.
And, *most of all*, my journal thingo... I'd fucking cry... 
*It couldn't...*
Half furious, half gibbering mess, I tear my saddlebags apart.
I can see straightaway the laptop is there. I dig into my bag-within-a-bag-within-another-bag and *there’s the journal.*
I breathe...
Thank fucking *Christ.*
The impending crushing sadness of an irreplaceable loss has flipped into *pure fury.*
*I'm going to fucking kill someone...*
I do a sound off of the other irreplaceables; the papers, passports, the keys.
They're all there.
Silver linings on a big, shitty cloud.
Ben and I both want to go and kick in the doors of the cleaner’s rooms. Go all SWAT team on the fuckers. Search *everything.*
There are three of them, they’re all young, around twenty-somethings.
They seemed so *sweet*...
It's so out of character. How do you go and accuse someone like that of something like this?
Let's find out...
I throw pants on. We run down the stairs and raise the alarm to the owner of the hotel; a gross, sweaty, slob of an old, short, fat, white *Frenchman.*
I’m suspicious of *everyone,* but I can’t hang around to see where this goes - I’ve got three credit cards to cancel...
---
I video call my parents. It's four in the morning their time...
Pretty fucking rude, really, but what am I supposed to do?
They both fucking panic when they see my call coming through, knowing that it must be pretty bad... I explain to them the situation, they go to DEFCON 1, bail me out, and make the necessary calls to the banks.
*A huge effort from them.*
That'll be an interesting conversation; “Hey, you know my son’s Visa card that you only *just* activated a few hours ago? Yeah, it’s been stolen in Senegal, West Africa. Can you cancel it and send out a new one? Thanks.”
Once that’s all taken care of I head back to where the forensic investigation is going on upstairs.
Here's the latest:
It seems someone’s climbed in through the hole above the door where the air conditioner used to be, and busted the lock on the way down with their feet.
I can’t imagine the little cleaners being able to do that...
*Suspect number one* now becomes a random dude who came into our room this morning and asked if he could charge his phone in our power outlet. At the time it seemed weird, but now it's starting to look downright suspicious, like he might have been *casing the room* or something.
The hotel mob know the guy we’re talking about, but the hotel standards here in Africa aren’t quite like what they are in the rest of the world, so they haven’t taken down *any* of his details.
And wouldn’t you know it, *he checked-out this afternoon.*
Our best description of the guy: Black. With longish hair.
*That's it...*
Not much for the authorities to go by...
The wife of the French slob (a gorgeous, fiery young local girl) promises that she’ll find out who this guy is, track him down, and get our things back.
*Exact a bit of African justice.*
*Fuck yeah.*
She seems to be even more pissed off about all this than we are. I think she’s just relishing the chance to vent her spleen at anyone. At times she’s even chastising Ben and I. Like *we* did something fucking wrong...
The firebrand gets us to 'dictate a statement' of 'the facts', which she translates and scribes into French. She's fucking *loving* the drama.
The sweaty white blob escorts me, with the statement, to the police station, which is just around the corner.
On the walk over he’s talking to me in bits of French and bits of English. He keeps grabbing my hand or arm to guide me around corners. His little fat fingers are all wet and clammy, and it’s *really* grossing me out. This might even be the most disturbing part of the day so far. I’m feeling pretty sorry for myself, but my pity is starting to shift over to the drama queen.
*How does she...?*
I’m *squeaming* as mental images of what goes on come up unwarranted in my head. It’s sickening, and just *sad.* I guess money talks... but the blob wouldn’t even have that much, *surely,* I mean... the hotel's *shit...*
---
It's clear that the cop's aren't gonna do fuck-all about this...
They're not going to file a report tonight. They're closed over the weekend. They'll do it on Monday.
Don't know what I expected...
So it seems that it’s just going to be damage control from here on out; we’re not going to get this guy...
What's pissing me off the most is that we’ve been here for weeks, *weeks*, wanting to move on and now I’m going to have to fucking wait *again* while the new credit card comes in.
Merry fucking Christmas.

## Chapter Nineteen
*Happy new year...*
I haven't done much.
I've printed a saved copy of my drivers license and got it laminated. *That's my replacement.* It's blurry.
It looks like shit.
It's not gonna work...
Just when I thought my travel papers couldn't get any less convincing...
The robbery has taken the jam right out of my doughnut, and I’m starting to become pretty antisocial; all I want to do is read books in our room and study some French lessons that I pirated online.
I’m utterly disinterested in anything else.
All Ben wants to do is smoke shisha and go out to bars. Poor bastard's *dying* for a wingman, but what’s worse is he doesn’t want to do it alone, so he’s putting the pressure back on me.
When I don't go out, he doesn't go out. Instead he just sulks in our room, with no music.
We’re at polar opposites at the moment, and the disconnect means we’re starting to get on each other’s tits.
---
*Ben gets lucky.*
He was picked up at a bar by a stunner of a girl from Niger (pronounced knee-share in the French tongue, I'd been saying Niger the same way I'd say tiger...)
Her names 'Asse' (Arse-ay).
*Piss funny.*
Ben's punching well above his weight if you ask me. He's been wearing a constant, smug grin on his face that's never been there before.
One day, I came home from a surf, and my bed reeked of sex.
*Reeked of it.*
*Fucking disgusting filthy motherfuckers.*
Sex isn’t the most pleasant smell in the world, even when you’re the one helping to make it, but when it’s not yours it’s positively *vile.*
*Rank.*
And now I’ve got to fucking *sleep* in it?
Is that a joke??
I can understand where his head was at; the room we’re in has one queen bed and one single bed, and through the luck of the dice I nabbed the queen when we first arrived.
Cramming two people onto that small single bed wouldn’t have really worked... But, if the shoe was on the other foot, I wouldn’t have fucked in *his* bed.
*No fucking way.*
---
Not a word was spoken...
*Nothing.*
And now he's disappeared...
I haven't seen him in *days.* I reckon he's had enough of me.
It's been a boon to be alone again.
But now, I'm in the shit.
I was relying on Ben financially after the thief took all my money and my means of getting money. With Ben M.I.A. I'd assumed I could get cash with the 'emergency credit card' that's been sent out.
*It doesn't work.*
I've tried everywhere...
A money transfer can't be done either, because it's the fucking weekend.
*Everything's shut.*
All the money in the world and no way to get it, and no one to prop me up in the meanwhile.
No way of contacting Ben.
I have 50 CFA in my pocket.
*That’s 10 cents.* 
$0.10, It’s gotta last me till either Ben decides he's done fucking Asse and comes back, or till Monday when I can get a money transfer...
---
You’ve never seen someone haggle so hard for street peanuts in your life.
They're all I eat, they're all I can afford.
Another day passes, with still no Ben. More street peanuts and tap water.
It's getting properly skinny now...
Money is like toilet paper. When you have a full roll you go through it like it’s an unlimited resource, using as much as you feel like to the point of being wasteful. Who cares? Plenty more toilet paper where that came from... But as the roll runs out you start to get more sparing with it, all the way to the bitter end where you’d be amazed what you can do with just one square.
In a word - you get creative.
The real trouble comes when you think that there are more rolls; so you use the one you’re on with reckless abandon right to the end, only to find out that you've just finished the last one...
Ever wiped your arse with the cardboard roll?
This is the money equivalent...
---
The lack of calories is hitting home, hard.
Still no Ben. I've gone through my ten cents. I wonder how long I can go without eating till I get in trouble...
I hate this room. I hate this place.
I'm moping around the hotel, conserving energy.
The three cleaning girls - oblivious to my situation - invite me to come join them for lunch.
Two days ago I'd mentally accused them as thieves...
Fatima, Fatu and Fatma. I have to ask them a second time to be sure I've got that right...
Fatima’s done the cook up. It's a *massive* dish of food in a steel bowl the size of a bus hubcap.
A whole fish sitting on top of caramelised onions and carrots and some other mystery vegetable, all sitting on a bed of oily, greasy, sticky brown rice.
*My eyes are like saucers.*
The smell is too much for my hunger...
We all sit on the floor next to the 'kitchen', in what feels like a shed.
*We eat.*
*It's the best thing that I’ve ever eaten.*
Food never tasted this good. *Ever.*
They jabber on in French while I try to be calm and polite whilst *shovelling* the food into my face.
I’m doing the whole 'monkey-see monkey-do' routine, copying their eating technique.
Apparently doing everything with your right hand is the go, or maybe they're just all right handed... Everyone’s grabbing chunks of the choice bits of fish and *flicking it* into everyone else’s part of the hubcap. My side is filling up quicker than I can make it disappear, even though I'm doing my level best.
They only know a smidgin of English, so I try out my smidgin of French from what I’ve learnt from hours and hours of my pirated lessons.
I thought it was pretty good...
They think it’s *hysterical.*
I’m saying some pretty mundane stuff, and they’re laughing like I’m a comic genius.
We talk about my family, and when conversation turns to girlfriends they’re rolling on the floor in stitches.
I didn’t think it was that funny...
As we keep eating and talking and sharing and laughing, sitting on the concrete floor, I think that this might be the single nicest way I’ve ever eaten food with people.
*Ever.*
It’s all about *sharing.* Sharing food, sharing stories.
It’s the anti-thesis of your typical dinner in the West; everyone with their own plate of food, on the couch maybe, glued to the idiot box probably.
Bloody *rectangles...*
The Western way of having a meal would seem completely *retarded* to these three. *It would take away what meals are all about.*
I'm as happy as a pig in shit, grinning like an idiot. This is just so *pleasant* on so many levels.
Then I notice Fatima's hands.
Then Fatma's, then Fatu's.
These three young girls have the hands of ninety-year-olds.
Weathered and withered and covered in lines that tell of a hard, long life. It’s in stark contrast to the bubbly young women that they are, always laughing and smiling. It saddens me a bit.
Even though I’m the hungry one and they’re doing all the talking, they still manage to lay waste to their quadrants of the bowl before I’ve come even close to finishing mine; I can’t get the knack of rolling the rice into a small sort of football, the way they do; squeezing the rice like you might squeeze your thumb.
I’m making a mess.
When I’ve finally finished it all - an enormous amount - Fatima goes into the kitchen, comes back, and completely re-fills my section.
*It’s too much.* It's all too much...
These beautiful people.
I love them.
---
Fatima’s a stunning girl.
*Stunning.*
Tall and thin, with a huge smile that never leaves her face.
Unfortunately for her, she can't hold a candle to Fatu.
Fatu is an utter *bombshell.*
One of the most beautiful people I’ve ever seen with my own two eyes.
Easily...
She’s short and thin but with curves that are an outrage.
An *outrage.*
It's an hourglass on steroids. Almost cartoonish. Wearing the figure hugging dresses that look like they've been painted on, she's been driving me insane for weeks.
Which I feel *awful* about.
The trouble I’m having is that despite having the body of a woman, her shortness and her baby-face and her childish manner have me not being able to place her age.
*At least not confidently.*
And that's a problem...
If I had to guess I’d say she was maybe early twenties, *maximum.*
She could *definitely* be late teens - which makes me a fucking creep.
It wouldn’t surprise me if she was seventeen... It really wouldn't. But it’s impossible to tell, one way or the other.
I decide to assume she’s a child and go with it like that. Play it safe.
---
The feast lasts me to Monday. The money transfer comes through, no dramas. *I’m flush again.*
Ben gets back on *Wednesday.*
He looks pale and pasty and sick; he mustn’t have seen sunlight for the whole week... He still has that uncharacteristic cheesy/crazy grin on his face.
Hat’s off to him...
Lunch with the girls has becoming a daily thing now, and it’s been *wonderful.*
Just bloody wonderful.
They’re the kindest people...
I’m glad I was robbed. It's the best thing that could've happened.
*I love this.*
This is what it's all about.

## Chapter Twenty
Shit.
It's all turned to shit.
Literally... *Shit.*
On a normal afternoon four days ago I felt a bit weird, just *off*. So I decided to take a little nap...
From then till now I've been spraying it out both ends.
Non-stop.
Four days and four night of a lurching gut, and either staring at the ceiling of our room, or walking to and from the toilet with hurried steps.
My relationship with my farts has degenerated into one of strained distrust.
*What a life...*
My stomach, despite never having anything in it, is massively *distended.* I look like one of those malnourished kids with the huge bellies you see on charity ads. Horrendously bloated.
I burp a lot. Three-second-long burps. It tastes like citrus and omelettes. *Tangy egg.* I'll be fucked if I know why... but it's fucking disgusting.
The timing could be worse, I guess. I’ve got nowhere to be but here.
Ben’s back from round two with Asse, and he’s even paler than before. He’s almost translucent and looks almost crook as I do. He's probably fucked off as much bodyweight as I've shat and vomited from the looks of things...
I reckon I might even look healthier than he does...
Kid needs some vitamin D and a sandwich.
I’m still joining the girls for lunch, but it's like I'm renting the food rather than buying it...
*Whoosh.*
Not that I care; I gotta eat something, and I love spending time with them.
I’m trying to decide whether it’s these lunches that have made me crook, or 'playing chicken' with the local tap water, or just bad luck.
In any case it’s a good chance to train up an iron-gut for the rest of the journey, and learn some more French.
I'm trying to look at the bright side...
---
It comes out at one of our lunches...
*I can't believe it.*
Fatima is at university, studying medicine. Fatu the bombshell is betrothed to a guy she’s never met, back at her village in the countryside. I find both to be odd because they’re both too young for that...
"Combee-en des anais ah voo?"
*They’re both 25...*
I'm 26.
It’s weird, but even now that I know that they're my age, I can't think of them in any other way.
They've become more like sisters.
---
*It's time to call it a day on Dakar.*
I've kicked the bug, the credit card has arrived, and there's no reason left to stay. Plus, I’ve been given my marching orders; the Douanes have had enough of me getting extension after extension on the LP, and have given me five days to take my bike out the country. Or else...
*Gotta go.*
Despite having a tonne of reasons to hate Dakar, I just can’t. It's taken so much, but given back with interest. Like *Stockholm Syndrome,* I’ve fallen in love with my captor, and I’m sad to leave.
Ben’s not done riding Asse's gravy train just yet, so he decides to stay in Dakar with his sugar mamma, and see how long he can live the traveller’s dream.
I'm happy with that result; the time’s been up on our partnership for a while now.
*I reckon I can do it alone...*
It’s time to lose the training wheels...
---
Proof of the pudding is in the leaving.
Even after months of living in each other’s pockets, the goodbye with Ben is pretty unemotional. A shake of the hands and a 'good luck'.
It's the opposite with the girls.
We've only spent a few weeks together - and in different languages at that - and yet I feel a true sadness.
There's a real feeling of severing a connection.
I know that I'll never see them again.
*I don't want to do it.*
I want to take them all with me.
I'm not sure if I'm making this up in my head. Symptoms of being stuck in one room too long...
I'm packed up. Ready to go. I just need to say goodbye...
*Fatu has a breakdown.*
I have to hold her till she finally stops crying.
Breaks my fucking heart...
Fatma starts to bawl...
Now *everyone's* crying...
*It feels like a wake.*
It’s the worst thing, about all of this; anyone I meet, any connection I make, *it's all temporary*.
They all have a little expiry date.
I lose five friends, but I go back to an old one.
*The Enfield.*
We're alone again.
For the first time in Africa...

## Chapter Twenty One 
*The Gambia.*
The only country I know that's officially got a 'The' in its name.
The road south to the border is as uneventful as the border crossing itself.
It's so lax that I thought it was just a beefed up, very busy checkpoint, I nearly rode straight through it...
When I say 'very busy', I mean fucking *packed.* As packed with people as the streets are after a big football match.
*Teeming.*
Despite this, getting through the border posts is a piece of cake.
I’m learning...
To get *out* of a country all you need to do is get the 'exit stamp'. *That's it...* The Senegalese Douanes gave me a “what the fuck do you want me to do with this?” look when I handed them my LP...
Getting into The Gambia is a breeze. Visa at the border and a 'temporary import permit' (T.I.P.) with very few questions asked.
Job done.
On the way out of the post the Enfield's speedo cable snaps.
The clock stops at 17,898.6km
And the speedo is stuck on zero...
Who's counting anyway?
---
The Gambia is tiny; the smallest country in mainland Africa; it’s only fifty clicks wide at the widest point. It looks like a flaccid penis pushing its way into Senegal...
On a good road it doesn't take me long to get to the River Gambia in the middle.
Trouble is that the capital, Banjul, is over the other side. And the river's bloody *huge.*
The only way from one side to the other is on a ferry. No bridges.
I buy a one dollar ticket for me and the bike (I *love* how cheap that is) and head to the front of the line.
---
*Hours...*
There's nothing to do but sit side-saddle on the bike and talk to anyone who wants to talk to me.
And that's quite a few people...
The local tongue here in The Gambia is, allegedly, English.
*I’m not so sure...*
I’m struggling to pick up anything anyone says. It's a little embarrassing.
When I do pick up enough of it, it sounds to me like a bastardised, pidgin version of English.
It’s kinda like how news reports from Africa have to come with subtitles...
For what it's worth, I reckon the feeling is mutual; I'll say something in the King's English and the locals will look at me like I just farted...
I'm already sick of the embarrassment when I have to ask someone to repeat what they just said *for the third time*, and still have no clue...
I just end up making up a reaction that *seems* appropriate to try to save face. *It never works.* I'm probably laughing when I should be frowning, or shaking my head when I should be smiling...
Fucking *embarrassing.*
I'm sure that lesser misunderstandings have left some people in deeper shit...
---
*Finally,* someone who talks my language...
Tall, talkative, middle-aged guy from Liberia.
Not Libya, *Liberia*.
We talk about everything and nothing for a few hours.
Eventually we get onto *the war.* It was inevitable...
I actually know a little bit about the war in Liberia. A couple of decades ago they were all massacring each other. Crimes-against-humanity type shit. Killing babies. Eating their still-warm hearts. *Awful* shit.
This guy's ok, all things considered. *Well adjusted,* even. An earnest type, and maybe on the faintly aggressive side of earnest, but that's fine.
He tells me that *he* fought in the war.
Wasn't expecting that...
"Yes, bullets cannot enter this body.” *Right...*
"*Really??* Wow... That's... *Impressive.*"
"Yes"
I want to tell him that that’s a load of shit... I really, really, *really* want to tell him. *Challenge him.* It'd be so easy. But unwise; he's gone from well-adjusted to unhinged in one sentence.
"You're very lucky."
Realising that he has a captive audience, he goes further...
*He pulls out a knife...*
"If you use this on me, I cannot bleed. Understand??"
"Yeah...! Whoa. Yeah right... Got it..." *Fuck!*
"My skin will break the knife!"
He's trying to hand me the fucking knife.
"No, no, nah mate, really mate... *nah...* nah mate, I believe you. You don't have to do that. Ok? I believe you."
The dumbfuck part of me is *dying* to take the knife and give him a pinprick on the thumb, see what his reaction is.
Nooooo... *No.* Shake it off...
"Yes. Good. My son; he has the juju too."
Juju, I think, means your sort of 'level' in black magic. Good juju, bad juju, sort of thing.
"Lucky him."
"Yes. The doctors, they try to immunise him, his skin, it bends back the needles" He shows me with his finger curling in the crook of his elbow how it works. "*Nothing* can enter his body."
“Well, that’s just a plain lie.”
...is right on the edge of the tip of my tongue.
My last words... The rest of the bullshit I’m happy to go along with; he’s obviously never tested his theory on himself with knives and bullets – it would have been a messy test – but now he’s obviously just feeding me shit, and we both know it isn’t true.
I nod. "It’s a very handy thing to have, this 'juju'."
"Yes. Later, I will show you the mother of my son."
"Ok... I'd like to meet her. Sure..."
I change the topic as we take a walk around the crowd. I don't really want to be near this guy anymore...
"This is my cousin." he says, pointing out a young woman.
"Hi, nice to meet you." I turn to my new buddy, whose name I've forgotten. "I thought you were going to introduce me to your wife..."
They both look at me dumbly.
"This is my wife..."
"Oh ok, I'm sorry, I must've got that mixed up... I thought you said *cousin!* Ha!"
No one else laughs...
"Yes. She *is* my cousin. My uncle gave her to me."
*This shit's fucked up.*
I've put my fucking foot right in it now... I've *definitely* offended them. I don't know what to say...
"I have, cousins..."
"Yes. My other wife, my father gave her to me."
*Fuuuuuck.*
Get me out of here...
Along comes his invulnerable, needle-bending, toddler son.
I’m looking at his hands and toes to see if there are any extra digits...
I go to detach myself from the conversation and get back to the Enfield, but, in the parting, he asks me for my phone number...
"Sorry mate, I don't actually have a phone." At least that's the truth.
He gives me his phone number and tells me to call him when I’m on the other side of the river and we’ll catch up for a beer.
Looks like I’ve made a friend.
Note to self: *Avoid Liberia.*
I go sit on the bike. The sun sets, it gets dark, and the ferry finally arrives. I pray that I don't see my new 'friend' again. Not in the dark...
---
The Gambia sucks.
Don’t come here.
I can't believe it's a 'tourist destination'.
Word on the street is that old fat fuck Europeans of both the male and female variety come to the country for a bit of the hot local action.
*Gross.*
The Gambians market themselves - and are very proud of - their countries unofficial title as 'the smiling coast of Africa'. *They talk about it all the time.*
*It’s a complete load of shit,* unless they mean it in the sense of 'never smile at a crocodile...'
*Jackals everywhere.*
Just like Morocco.
That sucked too.
This place is even *worse.*
I had one dickhead follow me around for over an hour through the labyrinth of a local market, trying to 'help me'.
I'd told him, many times, in no uncertain terms, that I wasn’t interested, till, finally, I snapped.
“Could you just please fuck off?? *Please??*”
"Hey! It's nice to be nice..."
"Yeah, well, *fuck off.*"
He *still* wouldn't leave me alone.
It turned what should have been an interesting, colourful jaunt through the massive, dingy and fantastic local markets into a pain in the arse.
*Ruined.*
And then the bastard had the audacity to ask for money after following me all the way back to my hotel...
The last few days have left a tacky, bad taste in my mouth.
---
My 'repaired' speedo cable breaks immediately.
I spent a whole fucking day on that thing... Looks like I won't be knowing anything about my speed or distance for a while.
*Piece of shit.*
I'm outta here...
I take the coastal route. Which, whilst incredibly close to the coast, is just far away enough to afford me exactly *zero* views of the ocean.
Spewin.
It's a short and boring ride to the border.
There's none of the hustle and bustle here of the border I came in on; it's *empty...*
There's a river, and I don't see a bridge...
Before I 'stamp out' of The Gambia I get assurances from the border guards that there's a way to get across the river with the bike.
They stamp my passport with no fuss, and tell me to head down to the shore and talk to 'the man'.
The river is about as wide across as I could kick a football if I got a run at it.
The water’s moving fast enough that I can see the direction it’s flowing in, and there's a strong wind whipping up some rippley waves.
I’m looking around for 'the man'. I’m still a bit concerned - there’s no barge to be seen out on the water. Or nothing of that nature anyway...
There *is* a 'pirogue', which is a big, colourful, wooden fishing boat sort of thing. They remind me a bit of the boats that asylum seekers use to get around in. The one I'm eyeing off is bigger than I am tall.
It doesn't look promising though... The pirogue is beached up on the shore. I’m wondering how we’re going to a) get the boat in the water and b) lift the bike in over the gunnels to get it inside.
There's a big mob of blokes loitering around not far away from the boat. I reckon I might be able to enlist their help.
We'll have to have a crack at it anyway... What else is there to do?
One of the mob comes over and tells me that 'the man' has gone to get the boat and that he’ll be back soon.
Good.
A few minutes later a man with a wooden paddle in a hollowed out *tree* soundlessly appear around the bend.
I look back over to the mob. My mate, he points, nods his head.
Thumbs up...
It's 'the man'.
I’m a bit confused, but then I realise that this must be the 'tender boat' that they use to go and get the anchored boat. Save themselves from swimming.
*Makes sense.*
'The man' gently steers over in my direction, and quietly pulls up to my feet on the shore.
We stare at each other in silence for a long moment.
*What??*
Nah. Fuck off!
This is a joke.
I break off the staring contest and look around at the mob of blokes who have walked over. They all look serious.
I eventually find my voice. "*This* is the boat??"
"Yes."
*"This??"*
"Yes."
*"Really"*
"Yes."
"But... I need to get the *bike* across."
"Yes."
"*You* can do that?"
"Yes."
"*This* bike?"
"Yes."
"In *THAT*??"
"Yes."
"Nah you can't... No way..." He just looks at me, quiet...
"Have you ever done this before?"
"Yes."
*"Really??"*
"Yes."
*I won't do it.* I can tell by eyeballing it that it's just not going to happen. Common sense says no. I don't know why no one else can see that...
I point at the big pirogue.
“How about that thing?”
Everyone laughs. So *now* it's a fucking joke...
The man shakes his head, "No. No good."
Well, I’m fucked then.
It's nothing more than a hollowed out tree, masquerading as a canoe. It looks like it's been hewn out of a tree that I could hug... It's only about half an inch thick...
It’s the shit you see poor people paddling down the Amazon on in documentaries.
The top edge of 'the boat' is only about six inches above the waterline...
If you gave me a paper, pen and measuring tape I’d be half a chance to do some math and tell you if this is going to work out or not...
My gut instinct knows it already: *fuck no.*
The mob assure me, quite calmly, that they’ve done this all before. Heaps of times.
*Pigs arse.*
Righto... *Fuck it.*
What else am I going to do??
"Alright. Ok..."
---
Me and three of the mob lift the bike onto the canoe as it is. We prop the bike up so it doesn't fall over with some chocks of wood wedged against the sides of the canoe.
If one of the chocks comes loose, well, there goes the Enfield.
*Splash.*
The boat sinks down deeper into the water as it takes the weight. Then sinks a little deeper still to fit me in.
There’s fuck all between the top edge of the canoe and the waterline, a couple of inches. It won’t take much for the whole thing to get swamped and go the way of the Titanic.
'The man' gingerly gets in...
*There's nothing in it.*
My heart is smashing. The whole scene seems absurd.
The bike looks utterly *ridiculous* perched there at the front. It's like it's not in the boat, but *on* the boat.
I can *feel* the instability, how it rolls when I shift my weight slightly...
How the fuck am I supposed to fish my bike off the bottom of a river?
Fuck... Can *I* even swim in a leather jacket and jeans and boots??
'The man' very, *very* gently pushes us off.
*Sweet baby Cheeses.*
Very gingerly, silently, he dabs his wooden oar in the water and paddles the boat forward against the current.
Under my breath, I swear every word I know in a string...
The ripples are spilling over the sides and onto my boots...
Time beads itself out into a short infinity.
I can *feel* my heartbeat move my *ears*.
*Pure fear.*
I don't dare move an inch. I grip the boat with white knuckles.
All is silent but for the ripples, the wind, and the dab of the oar.
We cross halfway...
At least it feels like half-way. I dare not turn my head to look back and check. 
*I think we're going to make it... If we made it this far...*
We're *actually* going to make it...
I start to crack a smile as we inch closer and closer.
The ripples come off as we get into the lee of the other shore.
And then we’re there.
I set foot, once again, in Senegal, and dance a screaming jig.
*Never in doubt!*
---
There's no Senegalese post here, so I've had to backtrack to the main border crossing to get my passport tamponed.
The bastards at the Douanes won't give me a laissez-passer without a carnet - unless I pay them 50,000 CFA, roughly $110.
That's not going to happen...
I take a temporary 'transit' instead, which only lasts 48 hours.
---
I head straight to the Douanes at the next town, Ziguinchor, and tell them there's been a mistake; they accidentally gave me a 'transit' instead of an LP at the border. They apologise for the mix-up and issue me an LP, on the spot, free of charge.
Travel hack.
*Winning.*

## Chapter Twenty Two
I've been surfing. Again...
There's something very weird about cows on a beach...
*I like it here.*
Things have become noticeably greener since heading south of the River Gambia, and this is actually quite a beautiful part of the world...
Wetlandish and sparsely populated.
Lining the sides of the roads are colossal, ancient looking trees. They’re bloody *huge.* They have that look where the roots start branching out above the ground, like taut tendons under skin, as they sprawl out in all directions. The circumference where the roots meet the ground has to be in the tens of meters. You could play a good game of hide and seek in one tree, easy.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_21.jpg)
Walking through the streets of Cap-Skirring, I notice by chance a motorbike parked on the road, standing out like dogs balls...
It means business...
*Serious business.*
A fully loaded KTM 690, an overlanding beast machine.
It's been pimped out too. *A lot.* It looks like it's been places. *Hard places.*
I head over to scope it out...
The license plates are from England! *Just like my Enfield!*
My head's on a swivel trying to spot the owner. Sure enough, it doesn't take long...
A young bloke in full offroad riding kit, casually eating a sandwich outside a restaurant.
I hotstep straight up and introduce myself. I might as well have said, "you’re young and white with a bike, *I’m* young and white with a bike, let’s be young and white on bikes *together...*"
It’s amazing how little in common you need to make a connection out here.
His name is JB, a 31 year old engineer from Bristol.
*Bloody pleased to meet you.*
We share war stories.
JB, essentially, has done what I’ve done; headed south.
It seems, though, that our styles differ. *Significantly.*
I’ve been making things up as I go along, JB is prepared for every contingency.
He’s organised. *Very* organised.
He and my dad would get along like a house on fire. They could compare lists...
JB likes to eat pizza, and will part with good money to do so, I'm a tightarse who won't spend more than a dollar on a meal.
I like cheap hotels, JB likes his tent.
He wants adventure offroad, I want nice tarmac.
It's obvious straight-away that we're not at all suited, but it's equally obvious, straight-away, that we're going to be riding together.
I’ve found a new wingman. It didn't take long...
---
JB has some contacts back in Ziguinchor – the brother of his auntie’s neighbour lives there, *apparently...*
He's going to go stay with the family, and he's invited me to join him.
*Done.*
JB, being the organised lad he is, has *two* cameras, so, after getting cleaned out in Dakar, I'm back in colour...
---
JB wanted to take the 'scenic route' back to Zig, I agreed to go with him.
I wish I hadn't...
*Soft sand.*
Soft sand is *the pits.*
Bloody deep, bloody soft.
It's fucking *impossible.*
I've no experience in this stuff, and mastering the fluky soft sand seems to be its own art.
It’s *incredibly* tricky.
The Enfield has a mind of its own, it's impossible to predict.
The front tyre bogs in and just goes wherever the hell it wants to go.
To try to control it is to crash; I can steer only by gentle suggestion, and then let it do what it must.
*Just go with it and keep it upright.*
It helps - according to JB - to go fast so that the tyres don’t have a chance to sink into the sand and you can simply 'float' across the top.
Trouble is that the prerequisite of 'floating' is having cannon balls...
I tried it. *Shat it.* Went back to a speed I'd be comfortable crashing at.
JB's not wrong, he knows what he's talking about; this is obviously him in his natural habitat. *It shows.*
While I was on an iron ore train in the Sahara, JB was riding through the sand dunes following the rail line. Three days and nights... Nothing but soft sand and camping out solo in the desert.
*For fun.*
JB’s *special...*
I manage to keep the thing upright through a few hairy moments and a lot of white knuckles. We hit a river.
It's beautiful, but we weren't expecting a river...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_22.jpg)
There's a military checkpoint. So we go talk to them.
*What’s all this about?*
Apparently it's *not* a checkpoint, but a border post.
If you cross the river you technically go into Guinea-Bissau, but then, if you follow the trail, you’ll eventually snake your way north back into Senegal again, and get to Ziguinchor.
The trail goes through a national park. Very beautiful. It's got *landmines* though...
If you want to cross the river, you can take a canoe...
So, if we don’t drown, we can get blown up instead? 
"Wee"
"Fuck that."
We turn on our heels and head back to the sandpit.
---
*I crash.*
Been threatening to do that for ages.
I was *so close* to the tarmac...
I hit a rut in the soft stuff, which grabbed my front tyre and pushed it hard to the right.
I bounced out of control, counter-steered hard to the left to try to bounce back upright - a fraction too late... I bury the bike in a flurry of sand and saddlebags.
Besides a sore leg where the bike landed on me, I'm ok. The Enfield is fine except for some twists and bends that a hammer can fix...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_23.jpg)
---
*Ziguinchor.*
We shack up with the auntie’s neighbour’s brother’s family; a big mob of six.
Despite the tenuous connection, they welcome us with open arms and big smiles; it feels like old friends.
I unpack my stuff. I've *shattered* my laptop screen in the crash...
*Pissed.*
No way to replace it, no way to fix it, and nowhere to buy a new one...
I try to fire it up. *It still works...*
Part of the shattered screen, about the size of a credit card, still displays... So that's going to be a test of patience...
---
Dinner time.
It's another lesson in the importance of family and meals. The bonding connection of sharing. Everyone eats from the same bowl.
The hospitality is so wonderful, and *genuine*.
It really is incredible; I wonder how I would treat my brother's neighbour's nephew and his mate if they showed up at *my* house.
Not with warmth like this...
The kindness is overwhelming.
With a captive audience we tell them the best of our travelling stories over a crate of beer.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_24.jpg)

## Chapter Twenty Three
*Guinea Bissau.*
Yes, that's a country's name...
It's an old Portuguese colony. That's what they speak here; Portuguese. In *Africa...* It's *bizarre.*
Things are really starting to heat up now. It's getting *tropical.*
The air temp on JB's bike registered 37 celsius today. That's nearly 100...
In a leather jacket, kevlar jeans, and a black, full face helmet on my head, it's fucking hot.
The border in is a breeze. No hard questions asked.
The locals call Guinea-Bissau just *Guinea.*
There must be a fight on with the neighbouring country for the name, *also called Guinea...*
Anyway, to the rest of the world, this place is *Guinea-Bissau,* and the other one is plain old *Guinea.*
Guinea-Bissau is one of one of the smallest, poorest countries in Africa, making it probably one of the poorest in the world, right?
*But that's not what I'm seeing...*
Bissau is a deadset *madhouse.*
The place is *humming!*
Fizzing with noise and colour and people.
Looks like they've got *loads* of food. *All I can see is food...*
JB and I head to a campsite out of town a bit, pitch up, and take a 'share taxi' straight back into town.
The markets are built out of ramshackle, rusted, corrugated tin. Tetanus city... Dirty and grimey and absolutely *manic.* Crazy busy. Constantly jam packed with an insane amount of people.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_25.jpg)
It's fantastic to see, and intoxicating to be part of the melee. We're just swept along in the river of people.
There'd be bugger all white people out here, so except for the occasional shout of *'branco!'* we're pretty much left alone. Branco would be 'white' in Portuguese, of course.
Sure, it’s dirty and grimy and poor, but it’s also vibrant and colourful and bustling and action packed.
There is something else about it though; an intangible feeling that you get for the place. I can't explain it.
This is what West Africa was *supposed* to be - this is the real deal.
*I love it already.*
---
*JB’s being organised again.*
Really, *really* organised.
He wants to apply for a Nigerian visa.
His 'mission' is to do Africa top to bottom, and he’s absolutely set on that.
To get to the bottom, he can either go through a couple of countries that are currently warzones, or he can go through Nigeria.
What a coin toss... Get shot, or get your ears cut off...
From what the Africans have been telling me, it’d be safer to go through the warzones.
*Everyone* has warned me not to touch Nigeria.
For my style, it's way, *way* too far into the future to make that call now; I don't even have a visa for *Guinea* yet...
But, JB is persuasive.
He has, of course, done his research, and apparently the Nigerian embassies in the next seven countries are loath to give a visa to anyone who doesn't *live* in the country that the embassy is in. In other words, to get a visa at the Nigerian embassy in *Togo,* you’d better be *Togolese,* otherwise 'do not pass go, do not collect $200'.
So, we get the visas.
*It was easy.*
66,500 CFA; about one hundred and fiftyish bucks.
So... *That's happening now...*
---
We’ve been told that the Bijago Archipelago is worth a look.
It's a small set of islands dotted off the coast of the mainland. The only archipelago in all of Africa, or something like that...
My LP will expire before I get back, so I head into town quickly to get it renewed at the Douanes before we take off.
The bloke behind the plexiglass takes my LP, writes down an extension of fifteen days, stamps it, and hands it back.
*Then* he asks for 10,000 CFA.
*Twenty bucks.* The original was only worth five...
In Senegal I got three extensions without paying a dime.
A stich-up, then...
I pocket the papers, thank him for his time, and casually walk off.
---
I make it out, and down the road...
Someone grabs me from behind.
*I shit my dacks.*
It's some minion... He's jibbering on in Portuguese. He's trying to haul me back. He's the opposite of happy.
I *panic.*
I just keep saying "no thank you" over and over again in Portuguese and keep walking away.
If he tows me back to the Douanes I'll be in deep shit...
He stays on me for about five minutes as I drag him along.
Exasperated and pissed off, he heads back - presumably to get backup.
*I run for it.*
Smooth...
---
JB and I pack a couple of day packs, leave everything else behind with the bikes and take off in search of cash machines.
*We're both completely dry.*
Apparently, there are only three cash machines. *Three in the whole country.* I guess they keep their money under the mattress here...
JB and I walk all over town to get to them.
We're unceremoniously rejected, one after the other.
*Fail.* Again.
So, it’s another 'oh shit' moment with money.
*I'm getting fucking sick of these...*
JB tries to test out Einstein’s definition of insanity, or is that stupidity? *Doing the same thing twice and expecting a different outcome...*
*Crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch...*
Einstein obviously didn't know a fucking thing about African cash machines!
*Halleluiah!*
Flush with money once again, we make a pre-emptive strike on lunch, and then grab 'tickets' for the ferry and sit and wait on the jetty docks.
The boat that’s taking us is a big old steel thing, the size of a big fishing trawler, so it looks like it’ll be a pretty quick and comfortable trip across.
While we wait on the jetty we get continually harassed by some dude from The Gambia (the smiling coast of Africa…) who takes a particular liking to giving JB the shits.
Entertaining.
---
It's been *forever...*
I’m starting to get toey on the jetty with a vague feeling that something’s wrong. Not with the boat either... *Something else...*
Can’t put my finger on what it is. I check and re-check my bag, but it's got all the stuff I need...
I feel like I've left the oven on...
---
*Finally* some action.
Nearly three hours after we arrived here everyone starts to move.
For some reason, all the punters are starting to load the *neighbouring* boat with furious gusto.
It’s a shitty pirogue.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_26.jpg)
*Wait...*
Ah... *shit.*
*Suboptimal*.
It's the size of a bus and made with planks of painted wood.
There are no seats, no floor, or even wooden planks to sit on in the middle. It’s just a big, open, empty boat from one end to the other.
I go take a closer look.
It's *leaking.* A lot... There’s a kid in there who's continuously bailing out water with a bucket...
We try to muscle our way through the scrum to get a prime seat, sitting on the sides; they’re the only real 'seats' there are.
The rest of the boat gets filled to the gills with luggage and goods that people are taking out to the islands to sell. The majority of the passengers just sit where they can on top of the shit.
The boat is *jam-packed*, front to back, top to bottom.
The motor on this thing is pitiful.
It's just a tiny outboard. I don't think that thing could cut grass... It's just stuck through a hole that's been cut out in the floor of the boat's hull. *Sketchy.*
They fire it up.
We peel out.
The outboard must be running on donkey piss; it seems like all of its power is going into making black smoke rather than pushing us forward.
It’s going to be a long, slow, arse-numbing ride.
The islands aren't *that* far away, but they're telling us it'll take *four hours* to get there...
The locals know the score, and they've raided a box filled with cartons of red wine.
JB's all over it.
Others are flogging food and home-made fruit-juices and snacks. Good stuff. Stuff, I’d usually go for, but I’m feeling *off*.
Can’t say why.
---
Time grinds down.
I want more and more for the boat trip to finish.
*I’ve had enough already...*
The wine's kicked in for JB. He's merrily enjoying himself.
I’ve still got that feeling that something *bad* is going to happen.
*Seasick?*
I go to let out another fart. A biggen. I've been dropping bombs all boat ride...
I realise very, *very* late that it's not all gas...
I batten down the hatch not an instant too soon and just *barely* avert what might have been an absolute horrorshow.
Ohh. No...
I think about it... Maybe it was just a fart...
If it is, I want it gone. *Safely.*
I very delicately lean to the right, to point it right at JB on my left and open the tap just a smidgin.
Softly... Softly...
*Clench!*
I very nearly make a total mess of it. And an enemy of JB...
Ok. Definitely, positively, 100% not a fart.
*Houston, we have a problem.*
My guts have turned into a puddle.
It wants out. It wants out soon. It wants out *now.*
So *that's* what's been haunting me; *lunch.*
"Don’t get on the boat", it said.
I check my watch. If I'm guessing right we've gone somewhere close to an hour. Three to go.
*Three hours...*
360 views of nothing but blue.
Fuckin *great.*
The first urge comes, gets held off, and goes. I can feel my stomach do a somersault and then settle down again.
I can un-clench. Sort of...
*Fuck me...*
---
After the fourth or fifth jaw clenching rush for the exits JB notices me sweating and grimacing and asks what’s up.
“I think I’m in trouble...”
He laughs his head off.
"What are you gonna do?"
"Dunno."
He pisses himself again.
*Great...*
---
I manage to hold it off in silence for an hour, and then *another* hour.
I dare not move an *inch.*
I feel like I’m in some sort of perverse, insane labour; time between contractions getting shorter and shorter, and the intensity getting higher and higher.
*The baby's coming...*
Every time it comes on again I feel like *this is it* – I’m going to shit myself.
By the time the second hour is in the can I’m fully dilated.
Just get to the island. Get to the island. *Just get to the island...*
I *will* make it.
---
*Eternity.*
*Finally,* I see a glimpse of the island on the horizon in the distance.
And just like that, *it’s game over.* It’s happening, and it’s happening *now.*
The dam walls are breaking.
Right - fucking - *now.*
This very fucking second.
Ohmyfuckingod.
My dumbfuck brain has seen the island and gone "Hooray, the island! We can totally shit now!"
I’m about to go fucking *Super Saiyan* with the effort to stop myself from shitting all over the place.
*I’ve lost the island...*
This epic shit is happening on this boat. One way or the other...
I take the initiative; it's better than pigheadedly shitting my pants.
I very, *very* gingerly make my way to the back of the boat, terrified to death that any moment I’m going to re-spray it.
The 'Captain', he's the one with the outboard in his hand. My Portuguese isn’t quite good enough for “Excuse me, captain, where is the best place on your boat to take a *furious* shit?”
I know *just* the charade though...
*Three words...* I rub my stomach with one hand and give a cutting motion across my neck with the other.
*Fuuuuuuuuck I can't hold it!!* I bounce from foot to foot. I can feel my face *shaking* with the effort.
The captain looks at me with sympathy, puts his hand to his mouth and flicks his five fingers out with his eyebrows raised - Seasick?
Shake of the head – *No.*
I make the same flicking motion, but at the opposite end. *The back end.*
His eyes go wide and his mouth goes slack.
I think he’s solved it...
He shakes his head vigorously and does the flicking motion again out of his mouth, nodding. I think he hopes something’s been lost in translation...
I furiously shake my head and repeat the same gesture out the back. *This won't wait!!*
He looks at me with a scrunched up face, like he just smelled something awful. He looks at his mates and then back to me.
Half of them are returning his expression of horror, the other half are smiling, enjoying the entertainment.
I quickly steal a glimpse over my shoulder to make sure none of the other passengers are watching this...
I see two hundred eyes all looking straight back at me.
Half in horror, half entertained.
*The whole fucking boat.*
JB's smiling wider than anyone. He's got his camera out.
"May I?" he shouts over the sound of the motor.
"I'll fucking kill you, *JB*! Don't fucking dare mate, nah, *I mean it. Fuckin don't!*"
Back to the captain. He points at the island and shrugs his shoulders, eyebrows raised – *can’t it wait?*
I shake my head, and point at the floor – nope, *right here, right now.*
The closer I get to having it done with the more my brain thinks that it's time to open the floodgates...
*I’m losing control!* Sweat drips off my face.
The Captain pats me on the shoulder and points me to the back of the boat.
It's just a plank of wood, then the ocean...
Times up; all the charades are going to count for nothing.
I lunge at the plank, dak myself, hang my arse over the back - not a second too soon...
*Fire in the hole!*
---
This plank of wood is now mine... I just owned it...
Non-stop, for *minutes.*
This is the most outlandish thing I've *ever* done. Hands down. And in front of a crowd of hundreds to boot...
I've never, *ever* shat in front of *anyone* in my life...
Yet all I feel is *relief.*
Release from hours of torment.
I enjoy the moment; this is as bad as it gets, and I'll never see any of these people again for the rest of my life.
Except JB...
---
*Bubaque Island*
JB’s half-cut on boxed wine by the time we get into the 'port.'
*He's had a great time...*
We walk about two or three clicks away from the 'village' to the western side of the island, find a stretch of beach, and shack up in the dusk.
It looked like the incident on the boat was going to be a one hit wonder, nevertheless I was a bit toey during dinner and the walk back to camp...
After what has been a pretty grubby day - not to mention the heat and humidity - I'm feeling the need to wash off.
The only option is the ocean.
The beach is less of a beach and more of a tidal plain; The sand has a muddy texture to it, and for a few hundred meters off the 'shore' the water never gets deeper than waist height. For me, it just feels creepy. I'm waiting to step on something unpleasant...
Apparently, the islands are *packed* with little stingrays.
Despite being completely creeped out, and in nothing but the moonlight, I try to get as deep as I can; *I really need this.*
I dive in, keeping my head out of the water.
All around me lights up in an electric blue flash. 
*Panic.*
Something's *attacking* me.
I thrash wildly, but that makes it worse.
When I realise I’m not dying, and not in any pain, I stop moving. All the light stops. Like flicking a switch...
Back to black.
*"What the fuck??"*
I scoop my hand through the dark water and nothing happens.
I do it faster, and my hand leaves a trail of bright blue light in its wake.
Like tiny fireflies. Tiny, miniscule, electric blue, water-fireflies.
*I think it’s going to be ok;* I don’t think they’re attacking me...
I get brave, and go swimming.
It’s like being lit up in a tesla coil, they're sparking all over my body.
*Like a fucking wizard.*
Before long I’m carrying on like a kid in snow for the first time.
I’m making electric blue water angels.
I'm laughing like a crazy-man.
*This is too good not to share...*
I yell at JB to get out here. Naturally, he thinks I’ve gone insane, he doesn't even want to get out of his tent.
I *insist.* He wants to know what's going on, but I won't tell him.
I have to actually get out of the water, and go dripping wet up to his tent to coax him out. Grinning like an idiot.
It’s a whole other mission to get him *into* the water without explaining why.
Once he realises what’s going on, he’s as disbelieving as I am.
The two of us go *berserk.* Two big blue trails following us around and lighting up in the dark.
It's the most wondrous experience I've ever had.
*What a day...*
---
*I didn't shit myself on the boat ride home.*
We want to spend one extra day in Bissau. It's unanimous; we really like it here.
I spend the day in the markets just being a part of the madness. Fresh produce, closely mingled with the fly covered butchers. Chop shops (for cooked food). Pharmacy. Koran korner. Auto. Knick-nacks. Each has their own un-official area.
Other than a few people dropping in 'branco', I'm mostly just getting confused looks from the locals, like they don't understand why I'm here. They leave me to my smiling self.
In spite of the incident on the boat I’ve become even braver with my food choices. After all, it can't get any worse.
I’m actively seeking out the local food, no matter how dodgy it looks.
The food places that the locals eat at are easy to spot. Sometimes they are houses and shacks; so-called 'restaurants'. But, most of the time, the place to eat is just a wooden bench and a table set up on a street corner. The table will be covered with steel pots. The biggest pot - which is usually an enormous bucket the size of a laundry basket - will be filled with steaming rice, and the rest are all filled with 'sauces'. You can take your pick.
I always have what everyone else is having. Safest bet.
The 'big mamma' will fill up a colourful plastic bowl with rice for you, cover it in your pick of the sauces, and hand you a spoon from out of the dirty brown wash bucket on the floor that someone before you has just used.
Give that a wipe with your shirt, if your shirt's not filthy...
The sauces are invariably of a greenish-brownish colour, with a layer of brown oil that rises and sits on the top.
The texture is that of slime.
You can add as much chilli and crushed up seasoning cubes as you like.
The whole shebang will cost you under a dollar. 
It’s customary to ask the big mamma for another ladleful of slimy sauce when your half way through; everyone does it, don't be shy - just hand her your bowl. No extra cost.
*It’s fucking delicious.*
I swear that they’re sprinkling opium into it or something. It’s outrageously moreish. It demands to be eaten till you burst. *I can’t get enough.*
Once you get over the fact that this obviously isn’t the height of hygiene - and it’s a bit of a crapshoot when it comes to getting crook (pardon the pun) - you can really start to enjoy it for how *good* it is.
As well as being cheap and plentiful and tasty-as-fuck, it also has the added benefits of living out the 'when in Rome' ideal. It's the *real McCoy.*
I can tell that the locals are proud of the fact that I'm sharing lunch with them.
They're always full of smiles, and eager for conversation.
First question, in any language, is always the equivalent of “you like this food??”
Smiles all round. Me, biggest of all.
"I *love* this food."
Cue laughing from the whole bench.
I do love this...
---
Today, the love of my life got married.
Could've been me.
*Nearly was me.*
Probably *should* have been me.
And then none of this would have happened...
I don't know how I feel about it.
Lucky...
But that doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem *right.*
But I do feel like I'm living the best life in the world; I wouldn't trade places with anyone, *anyone*. Not for quids.
How many can say that?

## Chapter Twenty Four
Guinea.
*Guinea*, Guinea.
I wanted to go in a straight line: A to B
JB wanted: A C E D F G to B.
Different styles...
We took the 'lowest common denominator of adventure' and went with the route he wanted: Inland.
Unfortunately for JB, it wasn’t all that adventurous. While I was revelling in some nice weather and good quality tarmac, JB called it “boring as bat shit”; the kid gets the shakes if he goes too long without dirt n dust.
Guinea-Bissau is pretty flat and sparsely greened, so there’s not a whole lot to do other than just chew the miles and let your head free-wheel.
After a couple of days of riding we get to a pretty obscure border post. I'm not even sure if this place has a name...
*Looks like a goat track.*
Getting out of Guinea-Bissau is pretty uneventful.
Usual stuff.
While I'm waiting for JB to get his carnet stamped out, I figured I'd do some bits and pieces around the bike. Just tyre kicking sort of stuff. I give the front tyre a really good squeeze to check the air pressure.
*Pop!*
Dislocated thumb.
It pops right back in...
*Awesome...*
---
The road between the border posts is a few kilometres of rock hop. It’s pretty standard practice that countries don’t want to spend a dime on the roads between borders. Why would they?
The Guinea side of the border is manned by two guys. We seem to be interrupting someone's lunch...
No one else is here.
For small talk, I ask them what the connection is between 'the two Guineas', as in, why the same name? They look at me like I'm retarded and just farted. No reply...
Righto...
We get our passports tamponed easily enough, and I end up getting offered a free LP for the bike, which doesn’t seem standard practice.
I’m absolutely *thrilled* with that; it’s the first time that I’ve ever spent *nix* for a whole border crossing.
Of course, I give JB the shits, "Hey, JB, remind me, how much did you spent on that carnet? How much mate..? Thousands, right? What a shame! My god! *Thousands!!* Such a waste!"
Winging it: 1
Carnet: 0
---
Guinea makes an immediate impression; gone are the dry flats, replaced by big, sheer faced cliffs.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_27.jpg)
After the flatness of Guinea-Bissau, it’s great to have some variety.
The road turns from a goat track to some really nicely levelled red-dirt roads. We nail it. Kicking up big clouds of red dust as we put the hammer down.
I've come to the conclusion that I’ll take a well levelled, red-dirt track over a shitty, potholed tarmac road. Any day.
By sunset we pull into a village called Koundara.
Koundara is in the middle of nowhere, nestled between the inland borders of Guinea, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and Mali. It has the feeling of a small, isolated village that has become a little bit overgrown.
Around this time of the day I always get a little nervy and fidgety, wanting to find somewhere to sleep and find it fast before it gets any closer to dark, while JB is happy to go and grab a beer and then worry about those 'details' after.
*We clash.*
JB's just happy to camp. Why spend the money? I won’t camp unless something’s gone wrong; there’s *zero* security, and why bother roughing it when a cheap hotel is cheap?
Plus, it’s been a long, hot, sweaty, grubby day in that leather jacket and jeans. I want *at least* a bucket and water to 'shower' with.
We end up finding a compromise when a local restaurant owner invites us to set up camp in the walled off courtyard of his house.
We’re both happy with that.
---
New day.
New country. New language. New currency.
There are no cash machines out here, so we exchange some of our CFA over into Guinean Francs.
We trade only as much as we think we'll need, as there are other countries further south that should use the CFA as well.
We only need enough to get us through to lunchtime tomorrow, when we'll be in Labe.
Language: Back to French.
I've got to admit, charades and Portuguese in Bissau were starting to wear a little thin...
On the way out of the village JB says that that he wouldn’t mind checking out Mali on the way to Labe.
"Really? *Mali??* I don't think we can go to *Mali* mate, do you have a visa? Shit, it must be a day's ride at least..."
"Nah, not the country, a village, same name, not far. We can check it out on the way to Labe."
"Oh, alright, shit, I thought you meant the *country!* Why are all the names around here the same?" I have a think about it, "How far is it?"
"About eighty clicks"
"Yeah, no worries. You got it on the map?"
"Yeah the *village* is marked, but there's no road on the map."
"Sooooo..."
"So a guy told me this morning where the turn-off is."
"Mmmm, oright then, you've got point."
We peel out of Koundara, and take the turn off onto an orange dirt road.
---
*Rough.* Things get slow.
---
By the end of the morning the track dead ends at a village that's *not* called Mali.
We're not even *halfway* to Mali, let alone Labe...
The 'distance made good' on the GPS is reading two fifths of fuck all. Looking at our GPS track so far, it looks like we've taken the path of a tortured river.
We grab lunch in the village, and get pointed out the way to Mali.
Out of the village and we have to *bush bash.*
Overgrown goat tracks going in all directions.
They keep branching and then branching again, and then branching again. Exponential options. It's impossible to know which way is the right way to go; we just keep on the line closest to 'as the crow flies' according to the GPS.
I'm going as fast as I dare to keep speed with JB.
But I lose him in the brush. I can't keep pace...
I get another glimpse of him again as I round a corner.
But I can't make the next corner to see which track he's taken....
I guess. Pick one. Then I guess again, and again...
Lost.
*I've lost him.*
Freak out.
*I pin the throttle.*
So far off the grid, it’s obvious that this is more than I can chew.
And now I’m on my own.
*Fuck.*
*Adrenaline.*
I'm going way, *way* faster than I have any right to on an Enfield in this shit with my skill level. *I just need to get a glimpse of that KTM again...*
I’m on the cusp of throwing in the towel and retracing my steps back to the village - if I can - when I spot him again; a *flash* of colour in the trees.
I chase him down like a man possessed, I can't believe that I'm actually catching him...
I pull him over, and he *cops* it. I tear shreds off him in a freak-out-fuelled rant.
He doesn’t think it’s a big deal, but agrees to keep me in his mirrors from here on out, or let me lead the way at my snail’s pace.
I know that I’m cramping his style.
*But I don’t give a fuck;* I’m way out of my league here and my mind is boggled at the prospect of being stranded solo.
We agree that this path is fucked; it can't be the one to Mali.
We've been given a bum steer.
We head back to the village for clarification.
---
True to form, half the mob points us one way, the other half points us the other way.
I’ve got serious misgivings about this; I’m usually happy winging it, but this is a whole other level of uncertainty and risk. Plus, the day’s half gone, we won’t get anywhere near Labe at this rate...
I’m happy to cut losses, head back to Koundara, and start again to Labe, tomorrow, *on the main road.*
JB is still enthusiastic about Mali.
Alright...
*Fuck it...*
We pick a direction and just go.
Not far from the village, we run into a 'bridge', which sounds vaguely familiar from half the directions we’ve been given.
The 'bridge' is just an arrangement of long wooden sleepers over a creek. Three planks wide, four planks long and held together, somehow, with bicycle chains.
*Dubious.*
I tell JB he can go first...
He doesn't hesitate.
He makes it.
I make it.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_28.jpg)
The path heads straight for the mountain in front of us that’s dominating the landscape; all brown with patches of green, it's like it's covered in a giant army camo.
Seems like we're going to have to go right over it then...
The path steepens. Becomes rocky.
*Very* rocky.
The bounciness starts to test the limits of my suspension.
Then the rocks get huge.
Like, baby rhino huge.
I don't have the clearance for this...
I could walk this faster than I'm riding it.
First gear, riding the clutch.
---
It gets hot as the afternoon stretches out...
This is technical as hell. It's lock-jaw scary.
To either lose revs, or to stall on a rock, or lose any forward momentum is to have a crash. And to have a crash is to be potentially fucked.
JB deals with the terrain by just dropping the clutch and going for it, scrambling all over the place, fast.
*I can't do that.*
He has the luxury of clearance. His oil sump is a long way from those rocks. Mine is not... I risk smashing it open like cracking an egg...
Despite my softly-softly approach I’m still bottoming the bike out all the bloody time and bashing the undercarriage on the rocks. The centre stand and exhaust pipe are taking the brunt of the onslaught, thank god.
All it takes is one bad bounce - crack - and there goes your bike. You’re fucked. You’re *done.*
Then what? Out here, I don't even know...
We break. It's *reeking* hot.
"Far out how's this??" JB's still enthused. I've got nothing to add... "This is the absolute *limit* of what I would dare to attempt solo..."
That's *JB* saying that...
*On a KTM.*
JB, who *loves* this kind of stuff...
What the fuck am I doing here?? On an Enfield??
JB checks his temp gauge.
Forty two degrees. *Way over 100.*
Fuck. I hope that's wrong. *Though it feels right...*
I'd kill someone for a breeze... I'm sure the Enfield would too. It's air-cooled. I reckon I could cook an egg on it.
The bike’s not up for this, I’m not up for this, we don’t even know if we’re on the right fucking path.
Shit, we’re likely lost...
Who the hell told us at the start of the day that we could get to Mali? *We’ve been stitched.* And now we're well too far in to go back. JB wouldn't go back anyway...
We check the GPS.
Despite spending the whole day at it, we're not even going to make Mali.
Fuck, we're not even close...
We can't break for long, we've got to cover as much distance as we can before dark...
---
We come across an old lady and a toddler, the only people we’ve seen on the track all afternoon. We stop for a break, and to get directions.
Turns out that despite all the chances to get lost and fuck this up, we seem to have lucked out and got it right.
According to the lady, this is 'the path' to Mali.
Brilliant.
Then she gets her saggy, flappy tit out.
I'm not entirely sure what to say to that...
We let that slide through to the keeper like it didn't happen, and ride on.
---
More rock hopping...
A dull thud and scratch as the Enfield bottoms out, *again.*
The bike loses all power and comes to a complete stop.
*The engine dies.*
Ohhhhh. *WHAT??*
*"NO!!"*
I bend my head and neck over like a panicked ostrich.
No oil spilling out...
*Thank fuck!*
What's broken then?
I turn the key off and on again.
No fuel pump whining like it always does...
No ignition when I push the starter. *Silence.*
Mmmm. Odd... If I've broken something, then all that should still work...
Electrical then?
Does that even make sense?? *No...*
I jump off and get down on all fours to inspect.
No damage... Except that the centre stand and that exhaust are dinged up real bad, and the kick stand's a bit flappy. I give the kick stand a wiggle, and I hear the fuel pump prime itself.
Kick stand?? Kill switch??
I hit the ignition.
The bike comes to life. Like nothing happened.
Thank fuck... for that...
I jump on and go after JB, who, true to form, has disappeared again...
---
The landscape turns from that washed out dry green and yellow camo to charcoal black.
There’s been a fire through here.
*Recently.*
We ride through the scorched earth till we find the line where the burnt meets the living.
It's a very big, very small fire.
The flames are only shin height, but they extend in each direction as far as we can see.
It’s a weird thing to just casually ride on through it...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_29.jpg)
My kick stand kill switch finally gives up the ghost. Some quick bush mechanics and it's disconnected.
This whole afternoon has felt like we’ve been treading water. Working so hard and going nowhere. *We're not making Mali.* That's obvious. It's time to start thinking of where we're spending the night...
JB suggests we bush camp.
I suggest he opens his eyes... I’m not too crash hot on waking up in the middle of the night with a burning tent melting itself onto my face and turning me into something that's been shrink wrapped...
*No thanks.* We *have to* find a village.
I'm out of water. Shit, I've been out of water for hours. I'm dehydrated enough to have the beginnings of a headache and a ripping thirst.
It's village or bust.
Things have eased up in terms of technical/difficult, and we can hammer it in the hope of finding something before sundown...
---
Pure jammy luck.
We run into a small village of about ten to twenty buildings with variously thatched and tinned roofs. It's called *Toumba.*
As soon as we kill the bikes, a guy comes up to us. He's wearing a funny hat, sunglasses, and a mean face.
"Pap-ee-airs"
*Papers.*
Oh *fuck off.*
JB and I pretend like we don't understand him.
So... Where to camp?
JB wants to camp somewhere outside the village, but I’d be much more comfortable somewhere amongst other people, especially with that bushfire around...
I ask Monsieur Papier if it’s ok to camp out somewhere in the village.
Suddenly we’re not strangers, we’re *guests.*
Papers are forgotten and we’re pointed towards what I can only describe as a gazebo. It's big enough for both tents, with a hard floor and a thatched roof. It's better than anything we could have hoped for.
School’s out. All the kids of the village - more than you would have expected for a village this size - come sprinting out of class, making a beeline right at us. 
I’m pretty sure that none of these kids have ever seen anything the likes of us before...
Everyone wants to shake hands. So much so that once they've shaken hands they walk to the back of the mob to line up for the honour again.
I reckon I've shaken hands with everyone three times over.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_30.jpg)
We get out cameras, and the kids go *psycho.*
We thought we were being mobbed before, but now they go totally ape escape.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_31.jpg)
Monsieur Papier instructs the kids to clean out our hut for us and they take to it with furious gusto.
As we set up our tents, we're being watched with rapt attention.
I make a song and dance of it - like a camping clown - and the kids love it.
While I'm doing that, JB goes and collects water from the local well, and tries to put it through his never-used water purifier. It seems to be more work than he expected, but in the end we've got a shitload of drinkable water.
Couldn't have done this without him. Wouldn't have dared.
Would've probably gotten cholera...
With the euphoric deadness of someone who's earnt their sleep, I pass out in my tent.
Best day of the trip?
Maybe...
---
I get up in the middle of the night and shit my brains out.
*I guess that purifier didn't catch everything...*
Despite severe and creative rationing, I use my last square of toilet paper, and there's still work to do...
*Great...*
---
*Breakfast.*
We're told that yesterday’s epic ride was the *easy* bit.
I don't believe it. There *must* be a misunderstanding...
"Vou set sure, monsieur?"
"Wee. Sa..." He points the way we've come from “Ne pas un problem. Sa..." He points the other way “Sa, ce tre tre *tre* difficeel.”
Even I can understand that.
*Easy* my balls...
Shit, I’m not sure if I could even do yesterday’s ride over again, let alone taking it up a level. I can't even imagine what that would look like without needing a rope and tackle...
Shit... What happens if there’s a bit that we just can’t get past? A bit that’s impossible? Or we get lost again or something?
This trip to Mali was supposed to be a little morning detour... A *jaunt.*
We buy some donkey piss petrol in bottles on the way out of the village with almost the last of our money.
We’re off into the unknown. Again...
---
Immediately things are tougher; the track is steeper; the rocks are bigger and seem to be arranged in such a way to make passage as difficult as possible.
*I can't do that.*
JB goes.
He's standing up on the pegs and guns it, bouncing all over the place, rocks flying everywhere...
He makes the top.
I wonder how much of that was skill and how much of that was just luck. I wonder if our luck will run out...
I thump my way up. Bounce and rev and smash my way to the top, hitting rock after rock, frying my clutch till I join JB.
White knuckled.
We're both grinning like maniacs.
*This is fucking stupid.*
One down...
---
*Mali as the sun sets.*
We *Shawshanked* it. Chipped and chipped and chipped away, until finally - battered and filthy and spent - we've arrived.
JB can't believe it, I can't believe it: The Enfield has gone the distance.
The exhaust pipe has been bashed and dinged to hell; it has no right to still be attached, the hell it copped...
The undercarriage has been *hammered.*
But we never crashed. *Not once.* JB did - and dinged up his KTM a fair bit in the process.
But *we* stayed upright, for two days of copping hell. 
A juggernaut.
*A battler.*
I'm bursting with pride for this little Enfield that could.
As we pull into Mali I fall in love with the beast all over again, patting the petrol tank like it's a horse. Talking to it.
I wouldn’t want to be doing this trip on any other bike...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_32.jpg)

## Chapter Twenty Five
*It won't start.*
At all.
*Silence.*
Key off, key on again. Hit the ignition.
*Nothing.*
Fucking *brilliant.* I've killed it.
I guess I shouldn’t be that surprised...
What now then?
I check all the rookie errors: kickstands, kill switches, petrol in the tank, and the like.
Nothing glaring...
Fuck, what if in yesterday's heat I've seized the piston...
I hit the ignition again.
Nothing.
*Fuck.*
I hit it again.
It *starts...*
I'm *not* happy. "What the fuck was that about?? You going all flakey on me?? Hmmm??"
It just keeps idling away, like nothing happened.
"Fuck..."
Hardly confidence inspiring...
---
The road is good...
Really, *really* good.
Red dirt, dead level. We *fly.*
Wind in the helmet again. *I've missed it.*
First stop: The 'Dame de Mali'. The reason JB wanted to come out here in the first place.
It'd better be fucking good...
Her head's on the currency here. She's a cliff. A big cliff. When you look at her from side-on she looks like a silhouette portrait of a woman.
It’s like the queen’s head on a coin, but on a mountain. So we're told... *We can't find her.*
But, the view from up here is fucking *spectacular.* I sit on my own cliff side, dangling my legs hundreds of meters above the world.
I chuck a rock over the edge and feel nauseous as it plummets till it's too small to see anymore.
*A messy death.*
It's just me, alone, on the cliff edge. JB's off somewhere else.
I leave the camera in my pocket. It could never do this justice, and some things just shouldn't be photographed...
I sit for as long as the caveman part of my brain will let me (it keeps screaming 'back away from the cliff! IDIOT!!')
Time to keep searching...
---
We find the Dame.
*I was sitting on her head...*
She's so perfect that I have to think it was made by man. But that's impossible...
But it's also impossible that something so perfect could be a fluke of nature...
In either case, she has a beautiful view...
![](/oblivious/images/Image_33.jpg)
---
Eighty clicks to Labe.
I stay with JB for a bit, and then he's just *gone*, leaving me in the red dust. I could tie him down in the mountains, but on this road he's just *unleashed the beast.*
So much for 'keeping me in the mirrors'.
I'm flying along too, in my own way. It's good to be finally making progress...
---
*Somethings not right...*
What's that *sound??* Something's *off...*
I make an inspection of the bike while on the move.
The front tyre is deflating. *Rapidly.*
*Shit...*
This'll be interesting... I’ve got the tools, and a spare inner tube, but none of the know-how.
*No fucking idea.*
Thank god for JB. I'm sure he’s done this a thousand times.
I pull up, get everything I think we’ll need ready. And wait for him to come.
---
Ok...
He might take a while to figure out I'm not coming. I'll make a start on the obvious stuff. It’s basically like changing a bicycle tyre, only bigger, right? And I’ve done that a few times when I was a kid. You don't need a *degree* to do this...
I’ve got to take the axle out to get the wheel off. Not sure what happens with the brakes when I do that... but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.
Off come's the axle nut with my big adjustable spanner.
I push the axle to slide it out. *It won’t budge.*
I whack it with the palm of my hand... *Nothing.*
I can hear my dad’s voice in my head saying 'never force anything'.
*Fuck that...*
I give the end of the axle a couple of wallops with the spanner.
Still nothing.
*I’ve failed before I’ve even started.*
I dig into my bags to get the workshop manual to see what it has to say about it; quite a bit, surprisingly.
“Remove the axle nut, release the clamp and gently tap out the axle”
*Clamp?* What clamp?
Oh, *that* clamp. Shit. What an idiot. Here’s me smashing it with a spanner, and there's a little screw locking it into place...
Screw's out.
The axle *still* won’t budge.
*"What gives??"*
'Gently tap out the axle'
*Bullshit.* Gentle my arse.
I whack it again with the spanner, still no result.
I daren’t do any more than that for fear I’ll fuck something up that I can’t fix.
I’ll wait for JB. He’ll know what to do...
---
*I feel abandoned.*
It's getting late...
Fucking JB...
Even if I could do the tube change myself, I don’t have an air pump. So I’m buggered.
Should I walk the ten clicks back to Mali to get help? That'll take a good hour and a half...
Why hasn’t JB realised that something’s up and come back to check on me?
While I ponder that, a couple of blokes wearing filthy rags rock up on a scooter.
They have with them a big set of 'tyre irons', and the equivalent of a football pump.
*You ripper.*
Without much said between us, they get to it like it’s no biggie.
*Routine.*
One of them tries pushing the axle. When that doesn’t work, he screws the axle nut back on a few turns and then starts belting the absolute shit out of it with my spanner.
"Oi!! *What the fuck??*"
He doesn’t seem to hear me. After six full blooded smashes with the spanner the axle reluctantly comes out.
The poor axle nut has been *creamed,* and comes out of the bashing looking a little warpy. *Don't know if that'll work again...*
Noted: When it doesn’t work, *hit it harder.*
Nice job.
Off comes the wheel and the two blokes go all bush mechanics on the tyre with their tyre irons. 'Tyre irons' are to motorbike tyres what teaspoons are to bicycle tyres; they’re just flat metal sticks that you use to lever the rubber tyre out of the metal rim, so you can get the air tube out.
My tyre irons are pissy little things that look like oversized popsticks. They came with the bike. These guys have got ones as long as your arms. Tyre irons, that is... I've got tyre iron envy...
Anyway. Zero shits are given for aesthetics as they *have at it;* gouging big chunks of rubber out, and scratching the green paint off my rims.
*I'm not impressed.* But these guys are saving my bacon. Bigtime. Tyre: peeled out.
Out comes the old tube, in goes the new one.
The bush mechanics use their feet to stamp the tyre back into the rim.
*Noted.*
With the tyre back on the rim, the air valve looks badly on the piss; it's at a really weird angle. That means that the tube isn't anywhere near where it should be in the tyre... Not aligned...
I want to start all over again; properly align it so that it doesn’t give me another flat down the road.
They just force it straight and lock it with a nut.
*Fuck it.*
Now’s not the time to be pedantic. *It's getting late.*
The tyre gets pumped up, the wheel goes back in and everything gets tightened up the way it was.
*Legends.*
And I did nothing.
And *still* no JB.
Where is that bloke??
I'm becoming less pissed off and more concerned that he’s found trouble of his own... Maybe he's wondering where the fuck I am... In a ditch somewhere...
I thank my bush mechanics profusely. One of them makes the international sign for money with his fingers. *Fair enough.* But I’ve got fuck all. After all that the poor bastards only get the equivalent of a dollar out of me. They're not impressed... I feel like a lousy tight-arse jerk.
Things are starting to get dim as I take off to find out what happened to JB.
---
Five minutes down the road, I find him *screaming* back in my direction.
Noted: When the shit hits the fan, *you're on your own.*
I tell JB the facts of the matter through some thinly veiled vitriol.
*Moving on.*
Labe’s not on the radar anymore, but we still want to get as far along the road as possible before night forces us to stop.
We take off at an absolute tear.
---
I round a corner just in time to catch the final moments of JB and another bike in a massive head-on collision.
Shit flying everywhere.
*I pin it.*
JB's on the wrong side of the red-road, and has slammed at full tilt into another bike carrying passengers coming the other way. *On a clear straight.*
*How the fuck does that even happen???*
As I ride up to it there are bodies and bikes laid out everywhere. In the carnage of all of it I’m thinking *'Dammit JB, my day’s been tough enough...'*
*Everyone’s ok.*
Well, sort of... It's a fucking miracle no one got *halved.*
No one's dead...
The two women passengers seem a bit tender... The man riding the bike and JB have come away without a scratch. *Buy a lotto ticket.*
The blokes bike is a *mess;* the front fender's been mangled, his tyre’s burst and his headlight’s completely wrecked.
JB’s beast machine has had the indicator clipped off and nothing else but a few scratches. Built like a brick shithouse, that thing.
JB's *venting his spleen* at the other rider.
From the game of charades, it looks like they did some sort of mad dance, like two people walking toward each other in a hallway, each mirroring the other's evasive action. *Collision.*
JB's telling him *he* should have gotten out of the way.
*Has he gone effing nuts?* JB was on the wrong side of the bloody road for Christ’s sakes! Who else could *possibly* be at fault? How is it that he’s not apologising profusely??
I cut JB off and tell him to pull his fucking head in before it gets knocked off.
*I don't want to be lynched in Guinea...* Somehow - even out here - we're drawing a crowd...
Now is not the time to be 'casting the first stone'.
Now is the time to get to work.
I pull my punctured tube out of my bags and JB goes to work re-patching it and replacing it in the other bike.
In the meantime I bandage up the two poor old ladies, who seem to have sprained their wrists in the fall.
It's interesting that the order went: 1) bikes 2) the old ladies.
Everybody's coming up to me saying that *I* need to pay. I tell them to go and talk to JB...
JB bodges through the tube repair and I bodge through the first aid. It looks like it's going to be two placebos of uselessness, but everyone seems to be feeling better.
Money exchanges hands - about ten dollars worth - and everyone is now suddenly happy again. *No hard feelings.*
By the time we get away from the crash-site it’s twilight.
That’s another first.
I’m always, *always* off the bike by now.
And it’s a shame, because this is beautiful...
The breeze is cool and crisp on my face, the colours have taken on a richness and depth that they’ve never had before. The world around us seems to take on a calm stillness...
Despite the madness and stress of the afternoon I’m still grinning from ear to ear in my helmet.
*What a day.*
![](/oblivious/images/Image_34.jpg)
---
Twilight quickly turns to darkness, turns to pitch.
We have to pull off the road and set up a wild camp, in the middle of nowhere in the middle of Guinea in the middle of West Africa.
While I’m still mucking around with tent poles in the light of the full moon, JB's already set-up, so he jumps on his bike and goes in search of dinner/breakfast.
Half an hour later he comes back with stale bread and a packet of biscuits.
"Which is dinner, and which is breakfast??"
---
*Labe.*
I take out all of the money in Guinea.
I eat and eat and eat.
I buy all of the toilet paper.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_35.jpg)

## Chapter Twenty Six
![](/oblivious/images/Image_36.jpg)
*Doukie.*
JB wanted *another* detour...
Remote. *Again.*
We land at the 'hotel' JB was chasing.
A hotel with a bucket and cup 'shower'.
A hotel with squat toilets to crap in.
A hotel that charges twenty five euros a night. That’s almost forty bucks... For this part of the world it’s nothing short of outrageous. *Who charges euros??* It has to be a stitch up. I *hate* being stitched up.
JB promises me it’ll be worth it; he’s read something somewhere and reckons it’ll be a go-er.
Well, I'm out of options anyway; there’s nothing around for hours and hours, it’s pretty late in the day already, and we got pretty lost on the way out here...
I begrudgingly unload the bike.
We’ve made it to Doukie just in time to fit in an afternoon hike. Our fearless leader, hotelier and hiking guide is an overflowingly talkative old midget named Hassan.
He's so bloody energetic, *he must be on something...*
His English is solid – a massive plus.
He tells us we should go on the 'Indiana Jones' hike. He's positively *busting*.
"Why do you call it the Indiana Jones hike?"
*"You will see!!"* he gives us a big, gap-toothed grin.
Well, I'm not going to argue. We head down a dusty beaten path surrounded by scratchy dry scrub and bushes that are giving my calves a severe exfoliation.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_37.jpg)
Not far down the trail we steeply descend down through gaps in massive, smooth, cool, grey rocks. Rocks the size of buses propped up on their arses.
There are trees growing in places that no one told them it was impossible to grow. Random cracks and crevices in the rock walls are home to oversized trees - *just* clinging on - whose roots hang down to us on the floor below like thick vines. Some of the trees look like they’re just *floating in mid-air.*
With the massive, tall rock walls all around and the trees reaching for every bit of sunlight in the canopy above us, there’s not a whole lot of sunlight left for us down below and the atmosphere is heavy and cool and damp.
*It feels like we’re in a secret.*
We speak in hushed tones...
---
![](/oblivious/images/Image_38.jpg)
For hours we hike about in the hidden places.
Streams of water come and go under dark and mysterious caves.
The labyrinth just keeps going and going and going...
Sometimes the rock faces open right up like a grand cathedral, and other times you have to suck in your gut to squeeze through the narrow gaps.
Forty bucks is nothing.
*This is priceless.*
I’m like a kid at Christmas, champing at the bit to run off on my own and soak in the dark beauty of it all by myself.
But we’re out of time; the sun has given up on us.
We climb out into the real world as suddenly as we'd descended in.
*The sky feels too big.*
Back at the 'hotel' there’s a massive pot of pumpkin and peanut curry and rice waiting just for us.
It’s one of the most delicious things I’ve ever eaten.
I hoover four heaped bowls of it, go for a fifth, and realise that if I do I'm probably going to break something.
After a bucket shower in the pitch dark I slide into clean sheets.
I *do* feel like a kid at Christmas.
*This is going to be awesome.*
---
I wake up to some honey on bread and a thermos of Nescafe.
*That’ll do just fine.*
Hassan wants to know if I'm ready for the 'K.A.H.'?
"What’s that?"
"The *'Kick Ass Hike'!!*" he wets himself laughing.
Fearless leader duties for today have been tossed over to 'cousin Mohammed'.
Cousin Mohammad doesn’t talk very much...
It’s already hot - the sun is only just getting started - but Cuz Mo, I shit you not, is wearing jeans, a jumper *and a beanie.*
It’s weird, but it's also not uncommon. In fact, it’s weird and it’s *extremely* common. For reasons I don't understand it's very popular in Africa to wear all of the clothes you own, regardless of how filthy hot it is. How they survive it, I'll never know.
We walk past 'Hyena rock', which should be called 'Pride Rock' (it's straight out of The Lion King), and then we walk past 'viagra rock', and take appropriately inappropriate pictures.
While we’re dicking around, we hear a dog barking in the distance.
"Shhhh..." Cuz Mo gets serious...
The dog barks again, far off.
“Gorilla!!”
*Gorilla!?*
Are you fucking serious?? *Holy shit!!*
We walk on in the direction of the barking.
I can't fucking believe this...
---
Across the other side of the valley we spot a troupe of baboons, silhouetted against the morning sky.
"Gorilla!!" Cuz Mo points.
I think he's disappointed that we're disappointed.
*Bummer.*
Still, pretty cool to see baboons, and who knew they bark like dogs?
We crack on.
---
The ground just *disappears.*
*Gone.*
Over the edge of the precipice it just *drops* - an insane and nauseating distance - straight down to the savannah below.
The cliff is so sudden and sharp that I can stand right on the very edge of it and feel the dizzy sickness of being scared shitless.
No barriers out here...
Looking to the side, the cliff, which seems to be leaning out, stretches away like an immense wall to a misty vanishing point. Looking ahead, I can just make out the paired cliff on the other side of the valley through the haze.
Looking down, there are vultures and eagles, *tens of them,* playing in the updrafts beneath us.
*Beneath us!*
Bloody hell...
Where the Dickens did all of this come from??
![](/oblivious/images/Image_39.jpg)
Guinea’s showing off and there’s nowhere else I’d rather be... *No one gets to see this stuff.*
I'm already happy to call it a day. I could sit right here and just soak it up, enjoy the air show. There’s something really special about these sorts of places. Something about being really high up and looking over the edge that I can’t put my finger on. Trouble is that when I’m close to the edge I have this weird urge to jump off, to see what it would be like.
*Not a great idea.* There’s still more to see...
Cutting a hole into the cliff face is a stream that meanders its gentle way diagonally the long way down to the plateau below. It occasionally spills over the edge to *waterfall.*
It makes a perfect path for us to follow down to the savannah.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_40.jpg)
---
The view from the bottom of the cliff is, if anything, even more impressive and imposing than the view from the top.
'The Wall' stretches off in both directions as far as I can see
Rich golds and blacks and whites all swirled about like an ice-cream.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_41.jpg)
We strafe the cliffside on a well-worn path, that then becomes a goat track, which slowly peters out to nothing...
Before we know it we’re bush bashing, and obviously lost. Now crawling on our bellies like under barbed wire...
*Bugger this.*
What the fuck is Cuz Mo doing??
Surrounded by dry, sharp, scratchy, thick shrub, I know for sure that this is *definitely* not part of the plan.
*It’s bloody hard work.* The sun is out and baking, and the humidity in the fog is heavy enough to make us pour with sweat.
---
*Hours...*
*We're never getting out.*
We're gonna die in here...
---
*A stream.*
Mo seems pretty chuffed with himself, like a man who's just saved his own bacon.
*Thank fuck that's over.*
We take the chance to have lunch.
Sitting on rocks in the middle of the stream we chow down on bread, and - of all things - some spaghetti.
The air is thick with butterflies that don’t mind coming in to land on us. The water is full of tiny fish that go mental for any morsels of food thrown to them.
Cuz Mo heads downstream a bit, strips off to nothing and gives himself and all his clothes a good wash.
Turns out that under the jumper, jeans and beanie were another two shirts *and* a pair of long johns.
*Unbelievable.*
How is he not *dead??*
Standing there, naked, he’s giving *us* a confused look, like we’re missing a great chance to do some laundry.
No thanks, Mo.
It all seems quite idyllic, but the serenity is being ruined by swarms of little bastard insects. These fuckers are actually pretty cute; imagine a tiny little wasp, all black, about the size of a grain of rice. Doesn’t *sound* too cute, but they are. Tenacious little fuckers too; unlike flies they won’t go away at the swoosh of a hand. *They don’t give up so easily.*
And they have an *obsession* with eyes.
The little fuckers make a beeline right at the corners, and stick the landing every, single, time.
Deadly accurate. Makes me go berserk.
*Christ knows what they want to do in there.*
I can feel them squirming in my eyes, trying to dig their way under the lids.
I can only guess it's an attempt to lay eggs in my eyeballs, or something equally horrendous. Take a shit in there. Or eat something.
But once they're in there there's no deterring them. Takes a while to dig the bastards out.
Unpleasant to say the least...
They're tenacious, but they're not tough.
Most of the time in digging them out I just smush them to death.
Unpleasant. Messy.
The only defence is to move. Continuously. Despite their accuracy, they’re useless when aiming at moving target. So it’s no problem, till you have to stop for lunch...
---
Mo takes his time doing the laundry, and then puts all of his wet clothes back on again.
Up the stream and back to the cliff face.
Dogs barking again. I *still* can't tell if it's baboons or some wild dog...
“Baboons!”, says Cuz Mo.
Wait... I thought baboons were 'gorilla'??
They sound *much* closer.
I’ve seen enough wildlife doco's to know that baboons are mean bastards, with big fuck off teeth.
I grab the biggest stick I can find and keep walking.
---
We eventually spot them, jumping through the trees.
Chimpanzees...
Or monkeys? I don't know the difference...
If baboons are 'gorilla' and chimpanzees are 'baboon', I wonder what 'chimpanzee' means?
---
What goes down must go back up, it seems. There’s a narrow cleft in the cliff where the stream has slowly chewed its path through for god-knows-how-long. It being the dry season there’s hardly any water at all.
Where the rock face is too steep to deal with without a grappling hook and a pickaxe, the locals have built 'ladders'. These ladders aren’t really ladders at all, but more like a bunch of skinny bamboo-like branches tied into stacks with vines.
*That’s it.*
As big as goal posts.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_42.jpg)
There's no cross bars to step on either, so you just have to stick your foot in the vines tying the stack together, and hope they hold.
*Pretty fucking dodgy.*
We climb and climb and climb, up through the waterfalls, all the way up to the top of the cliff again.
It's a flat walk back to the camp, through small herds of cows with ringworm.
Door to door: Seven hours worth.
Kick ass indeed.
*I love this shit.*
---
I could do this forever and ever and ever and not get sick of it.
I'm going to stay here as long as I can afford it. 
Which, actually, isn’t that long; after thinking we’d taken out enough money to last us for a whole month here in Guinea we’re already starting to get dried up from this 'hotel'. Twenty five euros a night will do that...
The nearest access to cash is a days ride away. And, of course, these guys don’t do bank transfers. I ask Hassan the question anyway, and feel immediately stupid for it.
So, we've gotta make hay while the sun shines.
Hassan offers to take me on an afternoon hike to see Hyena Rock.
"We saw that this morning."
*"Not like this!!"*
JB's knackered after the K.A.H. and taps out. I can't miss the chance, so we head off.
The trek is a short one, yet even more exfoliating than the K.A.H. army crawl. My legs die a death of a thousand cuts.
*It’s worth the pain.*
We stand on the rim of what looks to me like a crater, hyena rock sitting there, right in the middle, as though it were the asteroid the size of a high-rise slamming into earth.
The sun sets at our back.
Hard to enjoy the view though; the tiny wasps are all over us in thick swarms. I’m digging them out of my eyes again. Hassan tells me that that’s the *worst* thing that I can do.
"Really??"
"Yes, yes, if you *don't* touch them, they’ll fly away by themselves."
Alright, I’ll give that a go...
The next customer lands in the corner of my eye, and my eyelids go into *spasms.*
I'm *dying* to get it out.
It’s digging and *squirming.*
I'm squeezing my eyes like I've got a twitch.
My hand comes halfway to my face by reflex.
*I can't just leave it in there.*
*It’s driving me crazy!*
It’s probably making babies in my eyeballs.
Fuck this.
*"How long Hassan??"*
It's done doing what it came to do, and flies off.
I feel a little violated...
Another one comes flying right into the same spot, and gets immediately smushed by the angriest of fingers.
Bugger that. *Kill them all!*
---
![](/oblivious/images/Image_43.jpg)
*'Wet and wild'.*
We spend the day chasing rivers through the mountainous rocky scenery. Not nearly as spectacular as the K.A.H. or the Indiana Jones, but there’s lots of monkeys and chimps around, and not so many baboons, which is a plus.
This time Hassan took us along, and, true to form, he was bursting at the seams with enthusiasm and chatter.
JB's had quite enough of this hiking-all-day business and is itching to get back on the bike. He's seen enough...
More than that; he’s out of money. 
So am I, actually.
I’d like to stay a few more nights, *at least*, but if I stay tonight that’ll leave me with about 300,000 Guinean Francs, which sounds like a lot, but it's not.
Only just short of 50 bucks.
If I stayed tonight and tomorrow night I’d be left completely wiped out of cash, with no petrol in the bike and at least a days ride to anywhere that might have somewhere I can get more money.
In short, I'm painting myself into a corner. It wouldn’t be the first time...
*But I have to do at least one more night.*
I’d regret it if I didn’t...
JB can’t and won’t, and I won’t leave. Plus, it's too late to make a start on the bikes today...
*Not for JB.*
He kits up and peels off not long after lunch.
*Solo again...*
---
I head off with Hassan for the afternoon hike. This guy’s energy knows no end. I don't know how he's doing it at his age.
Off we go at a million miles an hour. He walks so fast I have to do a little skip every now and again to keep pace.
We get to 'The Wall', but by a different route, and just hang out on the precarious cliff edge for a few hours, certain death just a short slide away, watching the vultures and eagles circle beneath us till the sun sets over a misty view.
It’s pretty special, this Guinea place.
---
I come to...
*Pitch black.*
Where am I? *Where's the door??*
I need to shit.
*Now*.
I'm lucky I haven't shat the bed...
I feel around the walls. I still don't know where I am... All I know is that *this won't wait.* It's so dark I might as well have my eyes shut...
I touch something familiar. I know where I am. I *fly* for the door.
There's no time to grab the torch. I sprint to the outhouse squat toilet in the dark.
It doesn't go well...
---
Hassan's bouncing off non-existent walls with energy.
*I love this little guy.*
Last hike. No special names this time.
Hassan takes me to a network of caves that somehow feel like we’re walking amongst the roots of a giant tree above us.
We take a final trek to 'The Wall'. We hike down into what feels like it's guts. *Another secret.* There are more caves, this time underwater, I jump in and swim around. Icy cold waterfalls in the dark.
The mouth of the cave is the face of the wall, and I can swim right up to the edge, and watch the water fall, sickeningly, off the edge and into thin air.
*I don’t want to leave.*
But I can't stay...
I take full advantage of the free lunch and then pack up, and say goodbye.
Hassan apologises that it wasn't very good, and tells me to come back again in the wet season, when it's *much* more spectacular.
I do believe I'll do that, little man.
I'd like to get to Conakry today, the capital, but I reckon that's going to be a bridge too far for an afternoon ride...
A village named Kindia looks do-able...
Off we go at a tear, down the orange dirt road.
---
The scenery is *stunning.* Too bad I can’t look at it; the road snakes its glorious, undulating way through the yellow and green mountains and cliff sides, yet as soon as I lift my gaze off the road to get a glimpse of the landscape I go smashing into some bloody pothole at a hell of a speed.
*The road is a shocker.* Corrugated like an asbestos fence and riddled with potholes.
It requires one hundred percent of my attention. It’s a constant game of choosing the best path for the smoothest, fastest ride whilst avoiding those near invisible craters in the track.
And it’s a bloody shame. I’m already regretting my hell-bent attitude. I feel like I'm rushing something that could be special. I wish there was a way I could have broken the ride up into pieces, taken my time, and enjoyed what could have been one of the most beautiful rides of the trip.
But I can't do that. *I have no money.*
Head down, no rest breaks, crack on...
It's another road that's not on the GPS, and looking like being another tortuous path...
---
It's going to be *a lot* longer than I expected...
About half way into the ride I get to a river, which is serviced by a little floating barge.
While I wait for the barge to come over this side of the river I get to talking with a young lad, doing his laundry on the riverbank.
“Comby-en lays urs ah Kindia?”
"Sank"
*“Sank??!”* I was expecting more like three hours... *Max...*
I double check that nothing was lost in translation. And, yep, five hours. On my 'strong motorbike'.
*Shit!*
What's worse is that I know from experience that Africans are *never* conservative when it comes to estimations. If he says five hours it's probably more like six or seven...
I shouldn’t have gone on that hike...
---
It’s getting twilightish.
There's still a *long* way to go.
Things are getting desperate...
I haven't dared to take a break. My arse is killing me. My back is pinching *hard* between the shoulder blades.
It’s obvious that I’m not making Kindia today. I’ll have to just take my medicine...
I find a place marked 'hotel' in the smallest of villages. Despite its size, it looks like there'll be food and water somewhere. *That’s enough.* I’m exhausted. The last four days of hiking are compounding home *hard.*
The folks of the village go and rustle up the owner of the hotel.
She undoes a big padlock that opens a gate into a courtyard.
The place looks abandoned and derelict; it’s obvious no one's staying here...
She undoes a padlock to a room. *My room.*
It's small, dark, dank and smells it.
There’s a stained mattress on the floor with a dishevelled sheet on it. Like it's *just* been slept in.
And that’s it...
*It's rank.*
I ask how much. Works out to be less than a dollar for the night; easily the cheapest place I have ever stayed in. Yet it still seems expensive...
I’m weighing it up.
Nope; this is *much* too far gone. *I can't...*
I jump back on the bike and *fly,* as fast as I dare in the fading light. I *have to* make the next village before dark. And they *must* have a hotel.
---
*Light fades into darkness, into pitch.*
All I can see is what’s lit up in the cone of my headlight, and it's a shit headlight.
The road has changed from uncomfortable and hard into scary soft sand, which is *far* worse.
Time and time again I come to within inches of binning the bike.
*Shit day.*
---
*Kindia.*
I’m on the verge of throwing my toys in a tantrum.
I'm not even happy I made it. We're a long way into the night, and I’ve got to find somewhere to stay...
The good news is that the village is plenty big enough for cash machines and petrol and food.
I'm waiting at a busy intersection, trying to decide the best direction, when two cops on a scooter pull up alongside me.
"Pap-ee-airs". *Papers.*
*Fuck that.*
I’m nowhere near the mood for this shit right now.
“Je ne comprend pas...”
We go in a few circles, and I just keep saying I don't understand...
They’re *not* getting my papers.
We draw a crowd.
After a few minutes, I'm done, *I'm leaving.*
“Merci, au revoir!”. Thanks, bye! and I just ride off.
*Fuck 'em.*
They catch up and overtake me.
They're not trying to stop me, but from the gesturing it looks like they want me to follow them. I think that they think that I'm obeying them. I think that they think they're escorting me to the police station.
When they're both looking straight ahead I turn off down a random street, and they go straight on. I pin the throttle.
Police: evaded.
*There's a first time for everything.*
---
*What a pile of shit.*
30,000 francs a night, which is less than five bucks, which seems about right...
It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but I get the feeling that this place is less of a hotel, and more of a brothel/place-to-fuck-in.
I don't reckon many people actually do any *sleeping* here...
*I don’t care.*
I take a room on the proviso that I can park the motorbike inside.
--- 
*Yep, pretty sure it was a brothel...*
Noisy humans and music kept me awake most of the night, as well as an especially tenacious and invisible mosquito who wouldn’t be denied...

## Chapter Twenty Seven 
*Conakry.*
The first half of the ride to Conakry was a beauty.
*Tarmac.* I could’ve kissed it.
It’s the first time in a long time that I’ve been able to switch the brain off on a ride and let it free wheel without worrying about the bloody bike ending up in a bush.
Once inside the massive urban sprawl of Conakry the roads again turned to shit and the traffic turned into gridlock.
There’s no such thing as 'lanes' here - there are cars randomly packed all over the road - so there’s no clear path for me and the bike to lane split down the middle.
*It’s ragingly hot.*
And I'm wearing all black everything...
The sun feels almost *aggressive* as it beats down on me. There’s not a breath of wind. A million cars spewing hot black smoke. *Choking.* And I’m straddling a burning hot engine.
I have to sit in the sweatbox for hours, rarely getting over walking pace.
Absolutely fucked, I arrive in downtown Conakry. It’s a bit like Dakar, in that it’s a dirty great big city on the coast of the Atlantic with a hangover from French colonial influences. At least I know that the bakery will be on point; the French colonies all know their way around bread...
There’s a Christian mission that I had lined up as the cheapest place to stay in town from some advice I'd picked up.
160,000 francs a night. That’s twenty five bucks for some pretty basic accommodation. It's crazy pricey, but it's a clean bed. And it's not a brothel... I haggle my heart out, but they won’t budge; apparently they’re quite popular and I should be so lucky to even get a room...
Ok. *Just for tonight...*
Clean sheets, a shower, and air conditioning.
What a life...
---
JB's got me covered.
He's staying in a hotel - for free - through a contact he made in Bissau. I'm welcome to join him.
*Done.*
---
It’s a hotel alright...
*Problem is that it hasn't been built yet.*
What JB has been doing is camping out on the first floor of a five floor hotel, where they only got so far as pouring the concrete.
No doors, no toilets, no *nothing.*
Just concrete floors and a set of concrete stairs. A skeleton.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_44.jpg)
The 'contact' is the friend of a guy who JB met in Bissau. He squats here with his sister. Apparently, their father owns the hotel. I'm not sure I believe it...
I hardly recognise myself anymore... that even *this* is still preferable to paying twenty five dollars a night for a hotel... 
I set up camp in a room on the top floor.
*The penthouse suite.*
I have spectacular views of downtown Conakry and the Atlantic Ocean, which is just a golf shot away.
![](/oblivious/images/Image_45.jpg)
I’m given a bucket by our host and instructed to fill it up in the morning - which is the only time the communal water tap out the front will be dribbling out water.
I’m instructed to shit wherever I like.
*Really??*
Yep.
There's no toilet??
No. Pick a room with a view and that’s your toilet.
Doesn’t sound at all sustainable to me, but I’m not here for a long time...
Someone, at some stage, is going to be in for a *big* surprise when they go into the east facing room on the fourth floor...
---
This tent is a *sauna.*
A bloody *sweatbox.* Not a breath of air through the tent’s mesh; the night is dead still and stifling, even outside the tent.
But in here...
*I sweat and I sweat and I sweat...*
It’s impossible to sleep. There's no escaping it, *nothing* I can do. So *grimy*. Just greasy and grimy and generally *rank.*
In an act of claustrophobic desperation I open the mesh flap to try and invite *some* airflow in. *Anything*.
After ten seconds I realise I'm being *eaten...*
I close the zip in a flash.
*Too late...*
I can hear them. *Lots of them.*
*Shit.*
I turn on my headlamp.
They're *everywhere.*
---
By the time I'm done with the extermination the tent walls look like a scene from out of Kill Bill...
I lie down in a pool of my own sweat, and try to sleep.
*Bbbbzzzzzzzzzzzzztt...*
Fucking *bastard...*
I get up, locate the little mongrel mozzie - not easily, mind you - and kill it.
---
I'm woken up once, twice, three times...
By the fourth I'm going *insane...*
I'm so *itchy.*
---
As soon as the sun rises, I head - cap in hand - back to the Christian mission.
*Fully booked for the next week.*
*Suboptimal...*
---
The 'Consular' at the Sierra Leone Consulate is your stereotypical image of African bureaucracy; on the older side, with an oversized, badly fitting brown-grey suit with the arms cut off just above the elbows.
Like a t-shirt suit...
*He look ridiculous.*
He's surrounded by paper in his shitty little office.
He doesn’t want to give me a visa...
I get the distinct feeling that this man just doesn’t like the look of my face.
“Invitation letter... Where’s your letter of invitation? *Huh!?* You no get visa without invitation. No visa for you!”
At least they speak English in Sierra Leone...
I go find the nearest 'cyber', and forge a nice copy of a 'thank you for your booking' letter from a hotel in Sierra Leone. It counts as an 'invitation'.
Surprisingly easy to do, and it looks legit.
He won’t fact check it, I’m pretty sure.
*I hope not.*
I want that visa and I want it today.
I head back to the Consulate and hand it to him. Smug.
He still won't let me have a visa. Not till my interview.
"*Interview?* What do I need an interview for??"
"To make sure you're not a Somalian terrorist..."
*"What??"*
Is he being serious? A *white* Somalian terrorist, with a British passport, trying to get to Sierra Leone from Guinea?
This is *insane!*
But he won’t budge; *I need an interview.*
Not with him either, but with Sierra Leone’s diplomatic Ambassador to Guinea.
Utterly, utterly insane.
Not to mention a pain in the arse...
He can't tell me when that'll be, either.
What to do, then?
I sit in the Consulate and read a book. He'll run out of patience with me before I run out of patience with him...
---
Friday.
Saturday.
Sunday.
Monday.
Tuesday.
Wednesday.
Thursday.
Friday...
---
All day, every day, open to close.
*Nothing...*
I'm officially sick of this place.
It's been a rough week.
That fucking tent. Every night... Ugh.
JB got the shits; knocked him out for a few days. I was telling him it was 'mild', and to get used to it - it's the first time he's been crook in Africa...
In the middle of one of the nights, he thought he was dying. So he went to a local hospital.
At 3am.
A *huge* overreaction.
They ran tests and told him he'd contracted malaria *and* typhoid... He medicated up to the eyeballs to stop himself from dying, then during the day went and got a second opinion from a Western hospital. They told him he had *neither* malaria, *nor* typhoid.
I'm dubious of the whole thing, though JB's *convinced* he really did have both.
I've been crook myself; who knew that eating a whole pineapple would give you the shits? I ate the thing like it was a chicken drumstick the size of my head. The next day I had to waddle like a goose to stop the brown puddle that I was making on the floor from touching my thongs. *Close call...*
In better news, I've perfected the art of showering from a single bucket of water. Trick is to scoop it up gently with two hands and lift it up like you're offering it to the gods, and letting it slide down your arm, rather than what I used to do, which is just throw it at myself...
As for the visa, I've flip flopped from utter detachment to a sense of unwarranted entitlement.
From 'Zen Master' to 'American'.
In my more 'American' moments - demanding *something* be done - the Consular cracked the shits at me, “If I come to your country is this acceptable? Would I get a visa as easy as you ask for it? *Huh!?*”
My reply was very nearly “but this is fucking *Africa!!*” but I held my tongue, after all, he had a point...
I watch the sun set each night over the Atlantic, and the swarm of bats making their daily pilgrimage across the coast (yeah, *bats*). Sitting on my concrete slab, looking over it all, it’s not so bad.
---
Four books and sixty four hours later (seriously, four books, and I’m a one-word-at-a-time reader) I finally get my interview.
I step into the Ambassador’s office.
It's not just him and the Consular... As I shake hands, there's an Assistant, the Deputy Ambassador and a fucking army Colonel who's come along for the ride too.
A *Colonel* for Christ sake!
I know that that's a big deal; I've seen 'A Few Good Men' enough times to know that the bad guy's name is *Colonel* Nathan R. Jessup. *You can't handle the truth...!* Right? So what the Dickens could an army Colonel *possibly* want with interviewing me for a simple *tourist* visa?
They're all dressed to the nines; the Colonel even has his fancy hat. *I look like a hobo.*
Despite the absurdity of it all I still can't help but feel the nerves; this is some *serious* brass and, what, with that forged accommodation letter and all that...
*Shit.*
I sit.
It feels like a job interview crossed with some sort of bizarre interrogation.
The Deputy Ambassador opens up, he noticed from my application that I'm from London... *He* used to live in London...
*Fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck.*
"Do you know Primrose Hill?"
*I’m not from London.* I’m from Australia. I used a mates London address as a bogus residence to get my bike’s rego papers. I’ve been using it as my address for any applications ever since, just to avoid inconsistencies. It's been working fine, till now...
"Ah, no... Which one is that again?"
"Primrose Hill, you don't know it?"
"No, uh, I haven’t been there before..."
I'm sweating, *profusely.*
The Deputy starts talking about the hill, then about London. He's not really talking to me, he's more showing off his worldliness to his bureaucratic buddies. I chip in where I can to back him up with whatever it is he says. Gives us both the appearance of legitimacy...
The crisis passes, and we get down to it; why am I interested in Sierra Leone? What do I plan to do for money? Am I going to work in Sierra Leone? What am I doing for accommodation?
They each take their turn to pose an inane, toothless question.
It is - except for that brief pant shitting moment - a breeze. A waste of a week of waiting.
*I get the visa.*
It's just an ink stamp. *That's it...* The Consular has had it in his desk drawer the whole fucking time...
*Fucking protocol.*
The Consular, as he hands it to me, says "the Ambassador appreciated your honesty." *I nearly laugh.*
I walk out without a word.

## Chapter Twenty Eight
The Consular got the last laugh; he gave me one month on the visa, when I'd paid for three.
*Whatever.* I just want to move on...
JB left the moment he felt confident enough to straddle a bike seat without something awful happening; he had picked up the visa for Sierra Leone already at another Embassy (without an interview...) and, like me, was keen to move on as soon as he could.
I leave my hosts of the concrete paradise with a bottle of honey and a few hundred thousand francs.
Before hitting up the border, I first needed to take out some cash; I'm dry. Again...
It takes three goes at three different cash machines before I get the goods. I take out *bulk cash*, a hundred bucks worth. In Guinean Francs it's enough to choke a dozen donkeys...
I know I’ll have to do an exchange at the Sierra Leone border this afternoon anyway, and I'll probably get my pants pulled down over the rate, *but I don’t give a shit*, I'm sick of running out of money...
---
It’s around midday, I’ve put some good miles of empty, potholed tarmac between me and Conakry.
I spot a ways off in the distance a mob of cops on the side of the road, parked under a tree. I’ll 'buzz the tower' like I always do, and fly right by them if I can.
Checkpoints, depending on the country, will sometimes have a little hut off to the side of the road, sometimes not. Sometimes they’ll have a barricade, sometimes spike strips, sometimes a rope tied between two trees, sometimes nothing. Sometimes they’ll have military goobers there, armed with big nasty looking guns, sometimes big sticks, sometimes nothing.
Obviously you want to set your level of disobedience to whatever the checkpoint has on it.
*Horses for courses.* If there’s a barricade or a taut rope barring your way then you’re obviously not going anywhere. If there are big guns involved you might not want to do a fly-by unless you’re feeling lucky, *punk.* But if it’s just lazy cops kicking back in a hut on the side of the road, only blowing their whistles and waving their arms at you when it’s too late to stop you, it’s a safe bet that you’re in the clear; just wave back at them as though they were waving at you to say hi...
I’ve been amazed at the number of times when, coming into a checkpoint with military goobers stopping traffic with a held rope, a crisp salute and not showing any signs of stopping has been returned with a standing to attention, a returned crisp salute, and a dropping of the rope.
I always chuckle on the ride through, patting the tank of my very military looking Enfield as we ride off.
This checkpoint has no barricades and so it’s ripe for a fly by.
But, *I’ve been spotted...*
A young cop comes running out into the middle of the road, blowing his whistle and waving me down.
I try to give him the salute treatment, but that gets no response. I pull in where he directs me and leave the bike chugging away in idle and flip my visor open.
Always shake hands, always wish them a good day, always smile, always be a nice guy. Never give them anything more than what they ask for...
The cop is a young guy - I’m guessing around my age - dressed in official kit, which is unusual. *He seems serious about his job.*
“Moto Pap-ee-airs.” *Motorbike papers.*
I give him the LP.
“Passpor.”
I give him the British Passport.
Then, astonishingly, he asks for my immunisation certificate.
“*Immunisation?* What?? Pour-qwa? Pour-qwa voos avey beswarn de sa?” *Why do you need that?*
“Parsk je swee la police,” *because I'm the police...*
What a prick. He’s obviously trying to be difficult, and knows his shit – I've never been asked for my immunisation certificate before, *ever,* which is good, because mine's bogus...
I dig into my jacket pocket and find it in there somewhere. I hope he’s not going to read too much of it...
He doesn’t.
“Assurance.” *Insurance.*
*For fuck sake.* I give him my motorbike insurance, which, again, is bogus; it's just a printed out slip of paper from my insurer back in the UK. It's does nothing for Africa, probably does nothing even in Europe...
He's finally found what he’s been looking for; a chink in my armour.
“Ce invalid! Oo eh le ECOWAS assurance?” *It's invalid! Where is the ECOWAS insurance?*
Got me. *I don't have that.*
ECOWAS is a grouping of West African countries, kind of like what the EU is to Europe. I’ve been told before that I’d need this special ECOWAS insurance, but till now I’ve gotten away with bluffing my way through with that bogus piece of very official looking paper...
Roll that line out again...
"Nah, ce *valeed*. Regard: '*Aviva* Motorcycle Insurance', Sa ver di ker ce valid pour *too le monde...*" *Look: Aviva Motorcycle Insurance* (Aviva's just the insurers name, nothing special, but he doesn't know that...) *that means it's valid for the whole world.*
He switches to English.
“No! Not valid. Where is ECOWAS assurance!?”
“Nah, it’s valid...”
We go in circles again and again and again for a long time. I can feel my bike wanting to melt between my legs in this crazy heat from not having any air circulation.
He has all of my papers - I'm not going anywhere without them - so the game now becomes getting them back...
"Show me my passport," He gives it back, reluctantly. "See? Look at all the countries I’ve been to," I point out the visas "Maroc – ECOWAS, Mauitanie – ECOWAS, Senegal – ECOWAS, La Gambie – ECOWAS, Guinea-Bissau – ECOWAS and all of Guinea, to now - *ECOWAS.* Now *you* - with all the border and checkpoint - *you* the only one - in all of this ECOWAS - who say this not valid! Hmmmm?"
I'm holding the passport, and, throwing some misdirection, I promptly and subtly pocket it; the queen of the chessboard - the most valuable piece, *mine again.*
I make another comparison, this time asking for the insurance, which I again pocket, and then the same again with the yellow card. *Pocketed.*
*This is working well...*
By the time my mate's figured out what I'm doing, he’s only got my laissez-passer left, and he’s *not* happy about it.
The argument escalates into raised voices and frustrated gesturing from both sides. I'm not giving him my papers back...
“Ok, we go to police station now”, he says as he walks over to his motorbike.
*Shit.*
This is exactly what I don’t want to happen. Escalation is never good for me...
I put my head back and look at the sky and give him an exasperated sigh, turn off my melting bike, kick out the stand, get off, pull of the helmet, and ask him if they have any water.
*It's like flicking a switch.*
*Everyone* becomes crazy hospitable, and they fall over each other to get me a bottle of water. *Bizarre.*
I go sit under a tree for a while as the situation settles itself down. I watch as car after car rolls past without being stopped. *Unfair.*
I'm not sure why I've taken this tactic - seemed a weird thing to do in the heat of battle, to just go and sit under a tree - but oddly it seems to have worked in my favour; the overly tight situation looks like it’s starting to loosen up...
The young cop has escalated the matter, passing it on to his boss; an old greying fat-man who’s kicking back in a comfy chair on the road-side.
He’s equally unimpressed by my insurance papers.
I roll out my explanation again, making a big song and dance about all the countries I’ve been to, all the borders I’ve crossed, all the checkpoints I’ve passed, and this is the first time “in *all of Africa* that I’ve *ever* been given trouble by *anyone*”, and about how “*everyone* I’ve met in *all* of Guinea - Koundara, Touba, Mali, Labe, Doukie, Kindia and Conakry – *everyone* has been so kind and welcoming. *Guinea is such a great country. I love it here.*”
I've got him...
I’m not sure if it's my confidence in myself, or shaming him as the only jerk in the entire country, but he suffers a crisis of confidence, gives me my LP back and tells me I can go.
*I could tap dance.*
Handshakes and magnanimous smiles all round.
Gotta be happy with that. Totally and obviously in the wrong, I’ve still managed to get away with it.
Stoked doesn’t begin to cover it.
My shoddy paperwork has been a source of anxiety for me since day one; I dread getting in trouble for it. So to be found out like that, and be put under the blowtorch, and to be able to talk my way out of it anyway - it's *huge.*
It's like each country, each border crossing, each checkpoint is another feather in my cap. I must look like a fucking *peacock...*
*No one can touch me...*
I toot my horn and give them a wave as I chug off to the Sierra Leone border.
---
Getting out of Guinea is a breeze.
Pretty dingy border post. Passport tamponed with no questions asked. *Lovely.*
I bypass Customs - no one tells me I have to go there anyway.
While I pick at a questionable lunch of mystery fish curry with rice, I chat with the officials and change a fat wad of Guinean Francs for a much smaller wad of Sierra Leonean 'Leones'. What a clever idea; lets name the currency after the country's name. That won’t be confusing at all...
It's the first ever money exchange where there hasn’t been a need to haggle, the guy just comes straight in with a fair price which I take. I must admit it felt a little weird and I had the feeling like I’m somehow being stitched up anyway. *Who offers a fair price straight up?*
---
The Sierra Leone border post looks organised and modern.
A building made of bricks (very rare), which is way, *way* bigger than any border post has a right to be.
The size is ominous; the odds are that the bureaucracy is going to be heavy and confusing. What’s stranger is that for a big and modern border it seems to be mostly empty. And because it’s a remote-ish post, there’s nothing to be seen around it either...
I roll up to the building, and sure as eggs, it’s not obvious where to go or who I need to see...
A fixer picks up my hint of confusion immediately, like blood in the water, and starts tailing me.
Inside the building it’s just a really long hallway, with no signage. No 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Police'. *Nothing.* Just *doors...*
The only saving grace is that we're speaking English again. It's *so* much easier. I haven’t been able to just freely speak in English to officials since The Gambia...
I wake up a guy who’s sleeping behind a sheet of perspex, and ask him what he does. *Immigration.*
He doesn't ask any questions, stamps my passport.
*I'm in.*
I ask him where to go for Customs. *He doesn't even know...* I let him go back to sleep.
I ask anyone I can about where to find Customs. I just keep getting passed around...
*How can they not know??*
As a last resort, I walk way down the road to an army tent that's guarding the boom gate out. At least I lose my tail...
*They* have the Temporary Import Permits...
So that's the T.I.P., But they tell me that it's not valid until I go back to the building and find someone to give it a special stamp. They won't let me into the country without it...
It's all ridiculous.
Back at the main building I pick up my tail, again.
While I'm trying to find the magic stamp I accidentally stumble into an “Interpol” office - whatever that is...
They want to know *everything*. I want to tell them to fuck off.
Once they're finally satisfied, I go wake up some other guy at his desk. He wants to see my immunisation certificate. Second bloody time today...
*I've had a gutful of this.*
He flips through it, puts it down and then narrows his eyes at me.
"I want a Coke."
It takes me a second to realise what he’s driving at...
"That’s nice." I snatch my immunisation certificate off his desk and walk off.
Nothing here is making any sense...
I try to look confident, try to keep the impression I know what I’m doing...
I've talked to what feels like everyone, and no one can give me a straight answer. 
I even ask a guy having lunch outside. He's sitting on a crate, in the raging sunshine, eating a sandwich.
It's *him.*
*He's the boss of Customs.*
He's pissed off that I've interrupted his lunch. *I don't give a fuck.*
I get his signature and one of his minions fetches a rubber stamp.
*Done.*
I kit up and roll out.

## Chapter Twenty Nine
*Sierra Leone.*
The light, cooling forests of Guinea have given way to vast expanses of cleared land.
Palm oil plantations, as far as I can see.
Without the cover of the forest the temperature goes from uncomfortably hot to boiling. *Baking.*
The sun smashes down with no mercy, no respite. The air has a thickness to it. A foggy smoke.
It’s ugly. *Sad.*
I chew the miles on what these plantations have bought; the best quality tarmac I’ve encountered in Africa. *Bar none.*
So why am I shitting cinderblocks? Why am I freaking out a little?
Sierra Leone...
*Blood Diamond.*
I've been reading too much...
In the late 80’s and all of the 90’s, everyone wanted to be the boss out here.
If you had enough guns and buddies, you could be.
Being the boss is lucrative; Sierra Leone is *full* of diamonds. If you control the diamond fields you control the money, and if you control the money, you could buy more guns and buddies. Keep riding the gravy train.
*It made sense.*
Our old mate Liberia got all the civil wars kicked off. One of the military leaders knocked off the President and took power for himself. That quickly became fashionable, and started happening all over the place.
Democracy was dead; whoever had the biggest guns won power and took the money.
Rinse and repeat that for fifteen years.
*Fifteen years.*
And these weren’t your run-of-the-mill civil wars. This was different...
Tribalism and 'black magic' combined together to make for some seriously fucked up shit.
Like that cousin-sister-fucker I met back in The Gambia...
*Cannibals.*
Brutal executions in the street.
Hacking limbs off, just for kicks.
*Rape.*
Atrocities; par-for-the-course.
What the armies and militias lacked in training and discipline they made up for with gruesome cruelty.
What they lacked in numbers they made up for by pumping kids with drugs, brainwashing them, and giving them a Kalashnikov to go lay waste to those very villages that they had lived in.
It would take Western intervention - better late than never - to finally sort shit out; the Brits 'liberated' their ex-colony with a handful of soldiers, absolutely wiping the floor with the untrained militia...
That was ten years ago.
So yeah. I’m a little bit edgy...
*All those people are still here...*
What am *I* doing here??
Sierra Leone. Liberia. *Nigeria.*
Coming right up...
I keep reminding myself that it's all my choice...
---
It’s a pleasure to be back onto good quality tarmac again.
It’s been a while. A *really* long while...
Normally my mind is occupied with keeping the bike upright, but out here, on empty, perfect tarmac, it’s a different story.
No distractions.
For *hours.*
No conversation.
No music.
No movement.
No *rectangles.*
Just sit...
The road, the thumping of the bike, the handles in the hands, the feet on the pegs, the arse on the seat.
Loud, colourful sensory-deprivation.
A freewheeling mind, given its reins...
99.9% of what goes on I'm not paying attention to, but every now and again I *catch* myself, mid-thought.
And they've changed; my thoughts aren't what they used to be...
Invariably, my mind used to either replay one line of a random song over and over and over again - ad infinitum - or throw up an old piece of junk memory that bears no relevance whatsoever to what is happening *now,* or, running over and over in my mind the “what ifs” of something really, *really* shit happening.
*Or all three at once...*
In short: *Junk.*
A hyper, chaotic, jumble of useless shit. Repeated.
For hours... Without hardly realising it.
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
None of it was conscious; that’s just where my thoughts decided to take themselves. A mind flat out busy with the random and irrelevant.
But, somewhere along the line, the pattern *changed.*
*There are no songs anymore...*
Just that change, while slight, feels profound.
It's *quiet.*
Ever woke up in the morning and there’s *already* a song playing in your head?
That music player - on a constant, never-ending loop, from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep - has switched itself off.
Buggered if I know why...
It’s been no conscious, deliberate effort on my behalf...
The quiet has freed up space that my free-wheeling mind has filled with other stuff, and being 'bored' doesn’t seem so exhausting, or maddening anymore. It's just quieter...
I *do* still get random memories floating back, and the 'what ifs' haven't gone away.
That makes sense. I get it. I get that my brain is just doing its level best to fix problems before they’ve happened. But it’s a headfuck. It doesn’t help me any. *Solves nothing.*
I try my best to catch it, the 'what if', and look at whatever the hell it is in the cold light of more rational thought, and realise that, whether I worry about it or not, it makes no bloody difference...
Don’t let things be a problem until they’re a problem. Otherwise I’ll slowly drive myself insane.
Parking that, I actually find myself spending more of my time thinking *consciously,* rather than unconsciously. The thoughts, rather than whizzing around unnoticed in the background, have come to the front where I can see them.
I’m realising that a thought noticed is a thought I can *steer.* More by persuasion and suggestion rather than by actually grabbing the handlebars and taking it where I want to go. Like the art of riding in the soft sand...
I’m digging, and I'm coming up with treasures, and truths.
*My* treasures. *My* truths.
What are they? I couldn’t say...
In the same way that a dream feels so real when you’re in it, and the moment you wake up it vanishes completely; the good, the bad, the ugly; the garbage and the gold; the diamonds and the rough; all of it evaporates the moment I step off the bike.
Like a dream, it's still in me, somewhere. *It happened.*
It seems important.
My mind, when given it's reins, used to bolt.
Now it stays still...
*And I don't dream of the office anymore...*

# BOOK TWO

## Chapter One
Freetown. The capital.
Giant billboards start to pop up.
Things like a giant cartoon condom flexing its muscles “I am Mr. Condom. Trust me. Use me. I will protect you from HIV and STI’s”.
I can't help but laugh.
I know it's an important message. But wow. *So* bad. Credit where it's due though, it's the first time I’ve seen any sort of effort to educate the masses on health and well-being. So, props to them for having a crack.
Not long after, I pass a sign post for an outer-village: “Welcome to Devil Hole”.
Unbelievable.
Infantile behaviour aside, on the other side of Devil Hole we're jam packed in. A heaving mania of traffic and heat and colour. But, amazingly it all manages to flow. The bike and I are whisked alongside colourful markets and filthy slums, which are leaking some awful shit straight into the ocean.
To think that back when I was a kid, I wasn't even allowed to walk past the end of our street...
_Now, look at this crazy shit._ The streets are jam fuckin _packed_ with colour and people and _noise_.
It's a gridlock of humans. A mosh pit of them.
The bike is melting a hole in my jeans, and dripping oil everywhere while the mid-day sun smashes down on my leathers and I stew in my juices.
_We're not in Kansas anymore..._
Freetown.
Sierra Leone...
Blood fuckin Diamond in proper West fuckin Africa.
_The_ wild wild west.
I muscle my way through the pile. The thump of the bike is finding competition for attention with the rest of the cacophony, so much so that no one's really making room for me.
The whole place is *pumping.*
Hope it's not like this all the way to my accommodations...
---
I rock up at the front gate of 'Chou’s parent’s house'.
Who is Chou?
I don't know.
Other than sounding familiar, Chou is a local guy that JB (our mate the Brit on the KTM) met by chance _way_ back in Guinea-Bissau. A chance meeting, because Chou said that JB could stay at his folks place if he ever made it to Freetown; something similar to the arrangement that we had with that family back in Ziguinchor, which we both loved. JB said I'm welcome to join him. Bonus.
I bang a fist on the big metal gate. The place looks like it's a prison; solid metal gate and big concrete walls and barbed wire on top. No seeing in, no seeing out.
I bang again. Nothing.
I yell.
I bang.
A young bloke opens the gate. About my age. I say hi, apologise for the banging, introduce myself.
His name is Kenneth.
We blankly stare at each other.
Ah. _Okay._ So I wasn’t expected...
_Awkward._
“Arrr. I’m JB’s friend. Um, I think he's expecting me?”
Kenneth lets me in, more like a guest of JB’s rather than a guest of his.
I’m uncomfortable. I hate imposing on people. It makes me squeamish. This doesn't feel cool.
_JB’s not here._ He's out and about.
Kenneth and I hang out for a bit with just small talk. He doesn't mention staying here. Neither do I.
JB finally shows up. He hasn’t brought it up with the family, he's just made the assumption that it’d be cool.
Yeah, _not cool._
This feels gross; like I’ve thrust myself upon these poor folks and demanded their hospitality.
_We don’t know these people from a bar of soap._ Why should they offer us their hospitality? It doesn’t feel fair.
Kenneth say’s it’s up to his parents, I want out. All of this is making me squirm. I tell him it’s all good, I’ll just head to a hotel, it’s no big deal. But now he won’t have that; he’s _insisting_ I stay.
I insist back, but he won't budge.
*Fuck.* Now I'm in that bind where if I don't stay it'd be rude.
We head inside.
JB's sleeping in the master bedroom; the bedroom of Kenneth's parents; _in their bed_
*So fucking weird*.
The family have apparently shuffled their sleeping arrangements; the parents have kicked their kids out of their beds, Kenneth is on the couch, his brother, Jimmy, is on the floor.
Apparently they insisted that JB stay in the marital bed. They got really offended when JB refused it. JB just wanted to pitch a tent in the courtyard...
Kenneth's mum gets home. She insists that I, too, sleep in the master bed.
That’s the only arrangement she'll have.
Well, this is just plain weird now...
I argue, but I’m hamstrung by the hospitality. I'm so uncomfortable with this on so many levels.
Stuck. Trapped.
They're _too_ kind.
Take a bow, Sierra Leone...

## Chapter Two
This is the first time I've shared a bed with someone with a penis since I was six.
We wake up to a massive English breakfast.
It's easily the best breakfast I’ve had on the continent.
I feel awful about it; this is obviously not "par for the course" around here. I hate the special treatment.
I make up for my embarrassment with the most effusive praise I can muster, really laying it on with a trowel.
JB, meanwhile, hasn't been offered a full breakfast... He's busy eating some cereal that he bought the day before. The family seem *pissed* about that.
There’s a tension here that I can’t really describe. Maybe it’s just me, but _I_ feel tense. A weirdness. _There's something yucky about this..._
And I hate it. _Gotta get out._
So, that’s the day's plan: _Find an alternative._
Scoping out the potential accommodation options should take me on a walking tour of the whole city.
_That suits me just fine..._

## Chapter Three
Freetown is _awesome._
Parked on a mountainside, it's a big shanty town that ends at the ocean, and it's bristling with colour and action and music.
It’s pretty. It’s ugly. It’s modern. It’s old and shitty and grimy.
There’s money. There’s poverty. There’s a little bit of everything, and a whole lot of Africa.
Funny that this place scared the shit out of me just yesterday.
From break-out-in-a-cold-sweat-and-crap-your-pants to now: freely walking the crazy city streets, eating at the markets, squeezing through the crush and scrum of the locals as they go about it in the heat of the day. I feel as safe as houses.
It's a delightful surprise; I can’t wipe the smile off my face.
_What a place._
Surprise number one: People line up for things. _Unbelievable._ People, actually waiting patiently in line for buses or taxis or anything. _That’s unique;_ lines are normally treated the same way that they are by Asian tourists: non-existent. Here, people get served in the order that they arrived in. It's refreshing.
Next surprise. They seem to give a shit. About stuff. About improving their standard of living. Or at least trying to.
They have *bins*.
Now, that’s probably not going to sound like much, but Africa doesn’t _have_ bins; they have streets.
_Filthy_ streets.
The sidewalks and roads and gutters are, everywhere, full of rubbish. _Choc-a-bloc._
Not here...
I remember, way back in Morocco; I was having a sandwich with Ben the Aussie hitchhiker, and when he was done he just casually dropped his rubbish onto the ground. I was disturbed. His reply to my shock and horror was “yeah, well, you’ll change...” It didn’t take long either... After a few weeks of carrying my rubbish around, looking for a non-existent bin, I distinctly remember the first time I gave up and chucked my rubbish onto the ground. Ben, with a smirk, just said “finally”.
Since then I’ve been littering everywhere I go.
Having principles is great, right up until you’re put into a situation where they become utterly impractical. You either have to suffer for it or adapt. I'm more than a little ashamed to say I've changed. But, "when in Rome" and all that jazz...
The Africans sure as shit don’t care one iota about the cleanliness of their streets, or give a shit for the environment in general. There’s a lot of other shit to worry about, like _getting by._
So, yeah. Bins. Pretty big deal. Go Sierra Leone...
When I say "bins" by the way, I mean an open skip parked at the end of the streets. But hey, it's a start...
The streets are still filthy – culture and habit take a while to change – but at least they are making an effort.
Speaking of making an effort, there are billboards with painted public health service announcements all over, and a lot of the walls in public spaces have been painted with cartoons of the same; thing’s like HIV/AIDS awareness, practising safe sex, advice for pregnant women, directions to health centres specifically for young pregnant women and mothers, safe food practices, personal hygiene tips, how not to get cholera; you know, all the good stuff.
The "how to spot cholera" paintings take the cake; the way to spot cholera is "if it’s flying out of your arse, that’s cholera." Pictures and all...
I feel bad for laughing at yet another serious issue, but how can you not??
The power and electricity here comes and goes, and the water is more often off than on - just like everywhere else - but I'm still impressed.
They’re having a crack.
They’ve exceeded all my expectations.
---
The long day's walk around town is a big success; I've got accommodation in the bag. I end the day with sunset on the beach.
Freetown is the first genuine beach city this side of the Sahara. The beach itself is one of those ones that give you the feeling that once upon a time it would have been spectacular, back before the colonists came and fucked it up.
These day’s it’s a little bit trashy on the sand, and you have to spend a bit of your time looking at the ground to make sure you don’t step on something you wish you hadn’t, but that doesn’t stop the beach from being a hub; the long beach, off to a vanishing point, has every square inch occupied for beach soccer.
It’s clearly the local obsession.
Watching them play, you've never seen fitter humans.
They're chiselled from stone. Not an ounce of fat on them, and with muscles like anchor ropes. Perfect posture.
Bloody impressive.
No one’s ever wearing shirts either. It's disturbing. _Horrifying._ They have *the-most-fucked-up* belly buttons in the world.
_The whole world._
I don’t know how, or why, but the majority of them look like they’ve got a dick hanging out of their bellybuttons.
_Believe it._
A limp dick.
Hanging out where their belly button should be.
It's _revolting._
My best guess is that it’s the result of not cutting the umbilical cord properly when they're born, which then turns into a fleshy appendage.
I'm terrified that all the girls have them too... Unseen... It makes me want to retch.
I turn my eyes back to the ocean.
There are a handful of people swimming about.
_Fuck that..._ Have they _seen_ the river of Christ-knows-what that’s oozing out of the massive slum just around the corner? No-thank-you. Not for me...
The sunset, though, is spectacular. Watching the sun disappear over a wide, calm, blue ocean reminds me of home.
As the day dims and twilight comes on, I get my first reminder that this was - in the not too distant past - a war zone; there's a group of young men, all of them missing some or all of a leg, and they're all playing soccer...
One legged, with crutches, in the soft beach sand.
You wouldn’t believe the level of skill and _speed_ of these guys. _Lightning._
If I was playing and they were picking teams I reckon I would have been the last bloke picked; I couldn't have come close to matching their hustle.
I stand there, fixed to the spot in fascination and awe.
Impossible not to be inspired.
I stay and watch the match till it gets too dark to see anymore.
Time to go back to the weird place...
---
On the way back I picked up a heap of beers. Big, oversized, 10% alcohol, headache-in-a-can, beers; I figure it might ease up the tension back home...
As soon as I get in the front door and lift the sack of booze I’m everyone’s best mate.
_Mission accomplished._
After dinner, Mary - the massively overweight sort of step-sister or cousin or something - pulls me aside and says that we need to have a “family chat”.
Ahhh, god.
*What is this shit??*
Mary’s gotta be somewhere in her thirties and seems to be a bit of a firebrand with an unpleasant personality. Whatever it is she has to say I really don't want to hear it; I know already it'll be bitchy...
I’ve been here for one night and already we’re having “family chats”... Come off it...
She starts the family chat with no pleasantries; _teeing off_ on poor JB as an ungrateful mug.
*Why?*
The breakfast cereal.
“The Family” have seen it as him throwing their hospitality back in their faces, and have taken it _very_ personally.
I feel for the guy... Where I’ve been effusive and way over the top with my thanks, I don’t think I’ve heard him say “thank you” yet.
He never really stood a chance; he doesn't quite have the knack.
But Mary's just being a bitch. I can tell she fuckin loves it too; she’s not genuinely offended by it, it’s just a good chance to fire off some shots.
I back JB up as tactfully as I can and drop into the conversation that it’s a real shame I’ve gotta leave tomorrow...
Yeah, get me the fuck out of here.

## Chapter Four
Morning.
Before sliding out of 'Chou’s parent’s house' and back normal programming, I'm gonna have a crack at getting a visa for Liberia.
Liberia is the next country over, so it's crucial that I get it here, as there won't be another chance.
Liberia is, by the way, not *Libya*; in the same way that Mauritania is not Mauritius. Understandable to have them confused.
Anyway...
The embassy is decent, which is a little surprising, and I ask around for a visa.
I get given a few standard application forms to fill out; the usual questions. Add in US$120 and I can come back tomorrow to pick it up.
*Piece of piss.*
I ask the lady who gave me the forms what the cost for a Laissez-Passer for the bike might be; I figure I might as well kill two birds with one stone...
Four hundred _thousand_ Sierra Leonean _leones._
That’s a hundred bucks.
I can’t help myself; I laugh right in her face. _Hard._
_Fuck off._
I tell her it's ten times more than the most I've ever paid.
Ever.
She’s sticking to her guns.
I convince her to sort her shit out and go talk to “the boss”, the ambassador.
When she come back the price has, of course, changed. It's actually, 150,000 leones. A cheeky 60% discount.
_Just like that._
I laugh some more.
Crooked bastards.
I wonder how many they catch out... I tell her that it’s still _miles_ too expensive. She says it’s cheap.
I explain that it's *still* four times more than the most I've ever paid in all of West Africa. _How’s that cheap?_ She says “that’s Liberia”.
Whatever Trevor. I’ll get it at the border.
---
JB has had a big day of zero success.
He’s tried his luck for visas with Ivory Coast and with Ghana. Nothing doing... Apparently, Ivory Coast doesn’t issue visas in Freetown, full stop, "do not pass go, do not collect $200", while Ghana rejected him with the same old story that to get a visa for Ghana you _must_ apply in your country of residence, meaning that only Sierra Leoneans can apply for a visa here in Sierra Leone. Therefore, if we want a visa, JB will have to go back to England and I’ll have to go back to Australia.
*Good luck with that...*
I haven’t had a crack at getting this tricksy Ghana visa yet, but JB has tried it on _everywhere;_ he's been rejected the whole way down the coast.
I decide I’ll have a crack at it anyway: Where there’s a will - and patience and manners - there’s a way.
Some rules can be bent, others can be broken.
---
We're out of 'Chou’s parent’s house' with some pleasantries and gifts given.
And immediately it’s a weight off my shoulders.
We kit out our bikes and roll the short distance to the new digs; an old, run down two storey hotel. It's pretty pricey at $15 bucks a night, especially given that we've taken a single room with two beds... But, it does tick all the other boxes; it's got somewhere to keep the bikes; clean and tidy; close to town; secure.
And, there are showers.
_Joy of fucking joys._
I haven’t had one of those in months!
---
_Nirvana._
How can such a simple thing feel so bloody good??
When I get out my skin is all wrinkly. Not because I'd been in for too long, but that's just what happens these days when I touch water; ever since Conakry. It's weird; any contact with water, and my skin wrinkles like I've taken an hour-long bath. A little while later the skin swells and bubbles up like it's got air under it. Then, a little later again, it all flakes off.
*Every time.*
No idea why...
It's a little disconcerting...
_Anyway,_ dermatological apocalypse aside, I head back into town to the black markets to try to find a replacement for my smashed laptop screen that I busted back in Senegal.
---
_Not likely._
I've been handballed around for a few hours - in and out of dark dens of dudes pulling apart computers with questionable legitimacy. There are bits of old computer parts everywhere. Obviously they’re not going to have what I’m looking for but everyone promises me that _their friend_ will have it. I get dragged to the next place.
And so on...
One bloke tells me he’ll replace the whole thing for 1.6 million Leones. That’s... 400ish bucks; he say's to leave the laptop with him and he'll _fix it._
_Sure you will..._
The sun sets on the day and I've had enough. I pack it in and head back to the hotel.
---
We're going to be sociable.
Which is weird; I've very rarely the occasion to head out and experience the nightlife. Mostly because it's not my jam, and partly because I'm not the kind of guy to just show up at bars by myself and see what happens.
We walk the beach strip in the dark and pick out a random bar.
It’s a Monday, so the place is cleared out. It's not really a disaster; if we're being honest, all we wanted was a drink.
The joint's not at all upmarket, but it’s pretty flash for West Africa, I guess..
The bar is a big open building plonked right in the middle of the beach sand. The lights are flashing, the music’s playing but there’s nobody home... There are a few lads around but by and large the majority of the slim pickings of clientele seem to be dirty old white men and prostitutes. Well, “prostitutes” _is_ questionable, but the dirty old white men are undoubtedly dirty old white men.
_Yuck._
JB and I plonk ourselves down at the bar and order a couple of beers. Before I’ve even warmed the bar stool a girl comes over and unsubtly drapes herself all over me. She wants to know my name.
So, that’s a bingo on prostitutes...
I fucking hate this. I squirm on the stool.
Her name’s Christina. And she’s stunning. Beautiful. A classical beauty; huge dark eyes, big lips, high cheekbones, flawless skin. Over the top of these stunning features she’s slathered makeup so fluorescent that it’s almost neon.
She’s young.
_Much_ too young for this...
She's that sort of odd age where you couldn’t say, hand on heart, whether she’s 16 or 22.
I’m uncomfortable in a thousand different ways. Being accosted by a prostitute is my idea of a nightmare.
Christina's tenacious; she's not exactly picking up what I’m putting down...
It must seem to everyone here that this is _exactly_ what we’ve come here for; that this is even why we've come to Sierra Leone. We're dirty white men; why else would we be here?
_I feel sick._
No matter what I say, I’m still wearing Christina like a scarf. I've got my shoulders up around my ears, trying to shrug her off.
Now she’s getting in my ear about buying her a drink...
"I need to take a piss!!!"
I disentangle myself and go stand in the men's and do nothing for a few minutes.
When I get back she’s attached herself to JB, who looks happier than a pig in shit.
---
Blink.
_It’s 2am._
I'm drunk.
I’ve been drinking the whole time by myself after being abandoned.
The quiet observer, I just sit on my bar stool and sluggishly watching things.
They have the “Lingerie Football League” on the TV, which is actually hugely entertaining as a pure sport... _That's not a joke._ It's legit good.
The blue team are fourth down and goal; whatever the fuck that means...
A rank old drag-queen-looking prostitute crosses the floor and gets right up in my face. Like, _right up in my face._
She's talking all sorts of shit.
I tell her to leave me be, but she won't go.
I tell her again, but she's got me bailed up.
I'm *out*, I’m fucking *out of here!*
I shove off the prozzie and go find JB outside. He's got Christina curled up in his lap like a kitten. I tell him I’m heading off.
I haggle with the scooter-taxi boys over the fare back to the hotel, and then _fly_ through the dark streets of Freetown back to the hotel.
_Pissed as a chook._ I spread my arms and pretend I'm an air plane, swaying from side to side.
As I get back in and crash onto the bed, it dawns on me that JB's probably gonna bring Christina back to our room...
*Shit.* I'll have to make myself scarce if he does... I'll be buggered if I'll be in the same room while _that_ goes on...
So I stay up and wait for the inevitable...
JB gets home not long after me, empty-handed.
He blames _me;_ say's it’s my fault he didn’t _seal the deal_.
"What?! My fault? You need me to hold your hand to pick up a prozzie??"
"Prozzie!? What prozzie??"
"Christina..."
"Christina's *not* a prostitute!!"
"What?? Really JB? Come on mate, are you taking the piss?"
He's not. He's pissed, _and_ pissed off.
_Fight._


## Chapter Five
JB takes off.
We agree to tee up again before Nigeria - neither of us want to be solo for that shit - and he's gone.
Probably for the best.
He's been bloody good to me, which is more than I deserve; he's left me one of his cameras (I've been camera-less since the Dakar robbery), a water bladder, and some very handy waterproof bags.
I wonder if I've been nothing but a drag... A companion, and that's it. Where he has brought me so much, I feel I've given nothing in return.
---
I go and pick up my passport from the Liberian embassy with no dramas.
*Tick.*
I head straight from there to the Ghana Consulate and *talk the talk*. Using nothing but wit and charm I manage to get a meeting with the lady who is one rung below the top brass. I apply for the visa through her.
*This is gonna work.*
You little beauty...
---
I wander.
The markets are crazy. The food is fantastic; delicious green goo, some mystery meat and a bowl of rice. I’m loving being amongst it all.
I laugh my arse off at a random lady carrying a pineapple on her head. I swear, give an African woman a backpack to carry and she'll stick it on her head...
I go to buy some water to wash it all down, and the lady I'm buying it off smiles at my money and says “no no, this is *free* for my Muslim brother”.
*Oh dear...*
I *insist* that I pay for it, she insists back... I don't have the heart to tell her that, despite the beard, I'm not her Muslim brother.
I take the free water.
---
What's left of the day is dedicated to pushing shit uphill; blackmarkets, computer screens.
I look everywhere, all over town. No dice.
I'm sick of it, but, really, there's not much else for me to do...
I keep looking.
In a tiny computer store selling crappy old printers I ask, for the n'th time, about laptop screens. The guy opens a drawer, thumbs his way through a bunch of folders, and pulls out a brand new, *legitimate* screen that is made for my exact model of laptop.
*Un-be-friggin-leevable!*
I nearly jump on him.
What’s better is that he’s going to charge me 370,000 Leones for it, which at somewhere less than 100 bucks. *It’s a steal.*
Five minutes later we’re locked and loaded and it works, perfectly.
*Hallelujah.*

## Chapter Six
The sixth hour of staring blankly at a wall ticks by...
Ghanaian embassy; I'm headfucked, have been for a couple of hours...
I'm on the verge of cracking as they *finally* call me into the office.
They reject me. Just like that...
*“You must apply for a visa in your home country”.*
I plead, I *beg.*
No dice.

## Chapter Seven
Freetown in the mirrors.
I smash on down the peninsula. Bearing: south.
Today's the first day that the smoke or fog or smog or whatever it is has lifted off the city, revealing in all it's glory the blue ocean, the green mountainside and a gorgeous blue sky.
This is a very, very pretty place.
I’ve got high hopes for Freetown, I reckon it's going to do just fine.
The bike is still cooking itself in the sun and pissing an oil slick as it goes. It’s starting to make an oily mess of my saddle bags.
*Not good.*
Putting that aside, the Freetown peninsular is a bloody nice ride; the ocean to the right, good blacktop under the wheels, and mountains on the left covered in thick greenery.
This is just fine and dandy.
---
I see a wooden sign in the side of the road for *'No.2 River Beach'*. Hardly inspiring, but I’ve been told by locals back in Freetown that it's worth checking out.
Why not? I've got nothing but time...
I ride down the sandy side road till I hit a set of thatched huts with no walls that are set up right on the beach.
There's a teeny tiny little shantytown just around the corner.
I see some local surfers bobbing up and down on a surf break that is *Goldilocks*; not too big, not too small, but *just right.*
*I want a piece of this.* Oh yes...
I go ask the boss how much to pitch a tent in one of the huts for the night.
*200,000 Leones.*
Fuck off, mate!
That’s *fifty bucks.* Just to pitch my tent on a beach.
*Outrageous.*
I counter crazy with crazy and take a zero off the end of his price and pitch that back at him.
He doesn't like it...
*Let the haggle begin.*
In the end, we both feel like winners; 60,000 a day - that's fifteen bucks - *with* a surfboard thrown in.
*I’d make that deal.*
I unpack, pitch up, and sit on the sand.
This place is paradise. Truly.
I grab the surfboard...
Now, as an Australian, I'm legally prohibited from saying anything nice about any beaches abroad.
But this place? *Fwoar...* I've gotta break the rules.
The sand is *immaculate.* It’s so white that it almost looks like a shade of grey, and so fine that it’s like talcum powder, and so clean that it squeaks underfoot as I walk - then run - with my surfboard towards the water.
The leap at the waters edge feels like slow motion...
The water is a perfect flat teal with a swell breaking neatly across the beach.
The mountains surround the beach like a bowl.
The peaks almost seem to come straight up out of the sea.
It’s all achingly beautiful and utterly unspoilt. I set my mind to soaking in every single detail as I sit all alone in the crystal clear ocean, just me and my board, waiting for the next set to come in.
*Fan-bloody-tastic.*
The water temperature is “stay in all day”.
*I think I'll do just that...*
---
Two days straight; sunrise to sunset...
Thoroughly sunburnt. 
A confession: I’m shit at surfing.
Almost shit enough to say that I can’t actually surf. *That bad.* But that’s beside the point; no-one’s watching me out here; no-one's judging.
But, when I do put it all together - when I get it right - it's infinitely satisfying; a true, whooping thrill.
More than anything else, it just feels good to be using the body for the first time in a long time.
Sure, I can't surf, but I fuckin love the ocean.
*And this has been about as good as it gets.* 
But now, *I’m a train wreck.*
My skin shrieks at every movement. My spent muscles ache all the way down to the bone.
Sleeping on the ground hasn't helped me, I’m sure.
The idea of going surfing for a third day brings on an almost physical reaction. *Repelled.*
*I think that's enough.*
---
On the way out, I spot a white guy. How odd! That's certainly worth stopping for...
A bit of a hippie-ish looking guy, wearing long blonde hair and a pair of khakis. We get to talking.
He's weird.
*Really weird.*
In fact, he's just like me... One day he he decided to drive down here from the UK in his Landcruiser.
He points it out. It looks absolutely knackered... In fact, it looks completely fucked.
"Yep, it broke down. That was about, what? Ten years ago now? I think...?"
"You've been here for *ten* years??"
"Yeah. Yeah, I've got a wife and two kids."
"What? *Here??*"
"Yeah, yeah man I don't really know what happened... The 'Cruiser broke down here, and I just decided to stay a while y'know... Not sure when I'll get it fixed and go back home..."
*This bloke's not all there...*
Something about that smile; *straight out of an asylum.*
A cautionary tale, if ever there was one.
I wish him luck with the repairs and peel out.
Or... Wait. *Is he actually a genius?*
*Has he got it all figured out?*
He found his paradise, why would he leave?
As the beauty of the thickly wooded Freetown peninsula quickly gives way to cleared, sad, bulldozed land, I wonder: why am *I* leaving?
The road is in good nick, I open the throttle...

## Chapter Eight
Kenema.
There's a hint for Kenema hidden in the name...
Can you guess it?
Things have started to feel very *Blood Diamond-y*; the whole day's ride - all three hundred clicks of it - everyone walking along the roadside has had a big sifting pan on their head.
*Chasing diamonds.*
Every river I've crossed has people in it with their pans, sifting away.
This Kenema joint, it's a properly big village.
*Grimey...*
It seems to have it’s whole purpose wrapped up in diamonds. Buying and selling. There are shopfronts everywhere with diamond symbols painted on the front, “DIAMOND OFFICE” written in big letters.
After I’ve dropped my shit off at a cheap hotel (overpaid, at 50,000 Leones a night - about twelve bucks) I mop up my oily bike.
Some prick has stolen my can of spray on chain lubricant.
Fuckin *mug.*
I’m pretty sure it was one of those military jerks at one of the many checkpoints on the way here.
But, honestly, I don’t exactly *need* it; the whole bike's getting well lubed by that fucking leak...
Anywho, I've skipped lunch today and I’m bloody hungry.
Time. To. Wander.
---
There’s a young “big mamma” with a table and a bench on one of the street corners, selling chop. I chow down on a *massive* bowl of “cassava” which is like a potato (sort of), and some beans and sauce. It costs 1,000 Leones: twenty five *cents*. So cheap! So good!
I follow that up with some shortbread that I can only describe as vagina shaped. *Nom nom nom.*
I’m still not done; I smash down a massive sandwich filled with the greasiest deep fried egg in the world, plus some mystery deep fried balls which are probably just doughnuts.
*Dinner of champions.*
I fuck about in the shanty 'tetanus-waiting-to-happen' markets for a bit, but there’s not much to see or do. This joint is pretty much par-for-the-course. Though, that said, I’m still always a little shocked at just how filthy and grimy the corner of the market that sells fresh food is; grisly meat of who-knows-what animal getting hacked up by dull machetes; the hot, cloying air filled with swarming flies; mud on the ground that you slide on, that comes up through the holes in your thongs and gets in between your toes...
*Grimey as fuck.*
I head out of the markets; I want to go and check out a "Diamond Office". 
I've got to admit, they freak me out a bit, but, when else will I get the chance to look at a Diamond Office?
Gotta do it...
The place I pick out sells water pumps *and* trades diamonds.
*As you do...*
I get talking to a middle aged man who seems to be running the shop.
He's very keen to give me an education.
We talk raw diamond "grading". He’s drawing me pictures and everything, explaining to me the relative values by size, shape, clarity, and colour.
He tells me that all of the buying and selling is now regulated by the government...
*"All legitimate."*
I can tell by his tone that all this sentence is missing is a knowing wink.
I really want to see one of these raw diamonds but we can’t do that till I get the go ahead from “the boss”, *and he's asleep.*
That's a bit weird, not least because it’s just coming on dusk now... Why would he be asleep?
I ask him when they close.
“Never, we are open at night for people to bring diamonds.”
Right. *Of course...*
Small talk starts to take a more sinister turn; He seemed to physically twitch when I tell him I’m heading to Liberia...
*Really bad vibes.*
The questions start to have an edge to them...
*When are you leaving? Tomorrow??*
*Where are you going in Liberia?*
*Where are you staying tonight?*
*Which hotel?*
*I’ll come with you there... Let’s go,* now.
Heebie jeebies. *Big time.*
I can't cog it though; what the fuck is he driving at??
I run my head through my guide on diamonds in Sierra Leone: Blood Diamond.
I remember that Leonardo DiCaprio got put it jail at some point for smuggling diamonds into Liberia...
*Does this guy want me to smuggle diamonds into Liberia??*
Nah. *Surely not...*
Diamonds or no diamonds, I'm sure as shit not hanging around to find out...
I deflect his questions, tell him I'll be right back, real soon, and fuck right off.
*Smoke bomb!*
I look over my shoulder a few times on the way back to the hotel to make sure I'm not being followed.
*Yuck.*

## Chapter Nine 
*Today's the day.*
Liberia.
Baby heart eating, child soldier shooting, crimes against humanity Liberia.
Nightmares aside, all border crossings give me the jibbers, *and this one's bound to be a doozy...*
*I'm shitting cinder blocks.*
According to the maps that I’ve got, the only road that looks like it’s going in the right direction from Kenema to the Liberian border goes for about a hundred clicks and then stops at a dead end.
A road to nowhere.
I ask some locals on the ride out, and they *kind of* confirm that it *should* be ok, it *should* get me to the border.
I'm unconvinced.
I try to explain my misgivings to them using my maps, but this just seems to utterly confound everyone; don’t ask me why, but this happens *all the time;* maps always confuse the situation.
It's like no one's ever seen a map, or even gets the concept of a map...
Maybe they don't? I dunno...
Getting directions here in Africa sucks; I can't use maps, and what's worse is that I have to be very, *very* careful about the way that I word questions, because if I pitch a "yes or no" question the answer will always - *always* - be in the affirmative.
An example: *I point,* “Is the border this way?”
“Yes”.
*I point the other way* "Or is it *this* way"
"Yes! Yes!"
It doesn’t matter a lick where I point. Instead, I have to ask a non-binary question: “*Which* way is it to the border?”
If they answer "yes!", that's a dead giveaway that you're asking the wrong person...
I wish someone had told me this a long time ago; would have saved me a fuck-tonne of time running around on wild goose chases...
*I digress...*
I decide to go with the locals on this one. The alternative would be to take a fat detour, which I'm really not keen on; plus, why would they build a 100 kilometre road to nowhere?
Right??
I take off down the single lane road.
*No going back.*
---
The road quickly turns from good tarmac into loose gravel and rock.
It’s actually brilliant. Tarmac, *especially* the good stuff, is a bit soulless. It’s easy, sure, but it lacks *character.* Dirt roads are always changing, never the same, always engaging, always *interesting.*
*Fun.* I feel like I'm *really* riding. 
And this one looks like being a ripper; it's just good enough that I can take my eyes off the track for long enough to enjoy the surrounds, without the fear of hitting something I'd wish I hadn't... It's just true enough that I can take one of my hands off the bars to wave to someone passing by and not die for it.
All of that, and yet it's just rough enough that I can't just mindlessly open the throttle without ending up in the hedges. 
*The perfect ride.*
The dense rain forest crowds in on the dirt road and canopies overhead, enveloping my whole world in green, shading my path.
There’s hardly a soul out here. No villages to speak of, really.
"Traffic" is the very occasional Chinese-plastic-piece-of-shit motorbike, usually broken down. I try and lend a hand where I can.
There's also the occasional truck, which are a bit of a nightmare; they throw up a huge volume of the talcum-powder-like dust, completely browning out all vision. To get past them I have to put up with a few minutes of being increasingly dust-blasted till I'm right up behind their wheels, copping it, and - when I dare - squeezing down the side between the bouncing truck and the trees.
Hairy moments...
I'm glad there's not too many of them.
---
The morning and some of the afternoon goes.
I'm still miles from the border as I pull into a tiny village called Zimmi. This is where the road ends on my map...
I'll take a break.
I turn off the bike and it goes silent, except for... is that... *Celine Dion??*
*Again??*
I've been hearing Celine a lot. She's popular here. Hugely popular, actually. Go figure. It's like going back in time a few decades.
I've no idea why. It's bizarre.
I spot further up the road a border post.
"Bit early for that, isn't it?"
The actual geographical border line must still be hours of riding away...
I quaff lunch, and go check-out of the country.
It's no dramas.
*Cracking on.*
---
About seven hours after leaving K-enema, I land on the geographical border line in a rough as guts border town named *Bo*. It's not remote anymore. It's *busy.*
It’s late in the day. I’m pretty tuckered out. I'm panicking a little. I don't know if I'm happy to attempt a border crossing this late in the day; I get spooked even doing them in the afternoon.
Suffice to say that I'm feeling a bit of pressure to get this border crossing *perfect.*
There’s another Sierra Leone border post here at Bo, and they want to go through the motions again.
I manage to fob them off; I've done it all already, I'm not doing it again. I talk my way out of it.
Getting back to the bike, the usual crowd has milled around to have a gawk.
While I'm whacking on my helmet, a military guy with a big gun and a hard face that reveals an utter lack of a sense of humour, walks up to me and points at my saddle bags, “What is in here!?" he shouts "I want to see everything. You show me. Now!”
Aagh.
I hate it when this happens.
It’s rare that these guys understand how much they can make this puppet dance: a lot.
Pain in the arse more than anything...
I deflect; shake his hand with big smiles, ask him what his name is? Had a good day? Does he like the bike? Does he have a bike? He does!! That's great! Aren't motorbikes great? I'm really glad you like the bike! That's an awesome gun! Really cool! How far is it to the next village? Is it ok there? Not Dangerous? Are you sure? Great! Hey, Sierra Leone's been great. Such nice people here. Hey, where’s a good place to get food? It’s been a long day, I’ve come from Kenema. Where do you live? Hey, that's great! Anyway, really nice meeting you. Have a nice day!!
Smokebomb! Ka-Pow!
Waves all round.
*I’m actually getting pretty good at this.*
I cross a bridge and I’m onto the Liberian post.
*Here we go.*
The usual swarm of people come rushing up to offer their services as soon as I’ve turned the key. Like flies to shit. I have to wade through that to get to the post.
The building itself is actually pretty decent; bricks and everything.
Immigration are behind a very professional looking sheet of Perspex, which is usually a good sign that they’ve got their shit together.
Thwack. Passport stamped.
*I’m in.*
Too easy.
They point me to where Customs are but that’s not too helpful. For some reason there are *two* lots of Customs and I go to the wrong one, bark up the wrong tree, and then get sent off somewhere else.
In the end, Customs turns out to be three guys in plain clothes chilling out on a verandah behind a desk.
I introduce myself around and hand them the bike’s papers and ask for a Temporary Import Permit (Liberians speak English, so it’s TIPs and not Laissez-Passers here).
*They won't give me one.* No TIP.
A bloke who introduced himself as “Uncle Sam” tells me my bike's registration papers will be fine.
“You're already in Liberia, so you don’t need it. Look, *you’re* in Liberia, *the motorbike* is in Liberia, you don't need to import it. *No embarrassment.*”
That’s BS...
If it were true then that would be awesome - no paying for annoying TIPs - but *I* know that it's not; I know that I need one; I know that if I’m caught without one there’ll be trouble.
I know that it'll come back to bite me in the arse.
I tell "Uncle Sam" as much, but he’s not budging. He just keeps saying *“no embarrassment”*.
I beg him; "I don’t *care* if I don’t need it, I’d like one anyway, *please*."
No.
I insist again.
You don't need one. *No embarrassment.*
*I'll pay!!*
No.
I can't reason with him. I can't pay him.
"No embarrassment, I promise you, no embarrassment."
Fuck!
I try to find someone else who might help me out... In the process I get asked questions about all sorts of other shit I’d rather not talk about; one guy *thoroughly* checks out my immunisation card and says it doesn't have yellow fever...
*Shit!!*
I explain to him that the one marked “typhoid” is a special injection - "multiple, big injection!" - that covers everything.
What a load of shit.
He gives me a sort of look, and then just waves me off. I can’t believe I'm still getting away with this... I resolve to forge a yellow fever vaccination in that book the next chance I have...
(To be clear, I've had the injection, it's just not written down anywhere... Yeah, I'm not fucking *crazy*)
In the end there’s no big Customs boss that I can talk to. I try Uncle Sam out one last time, but he just says “No embarrassment. You tell them to talk to Uncle Sam if you have a problem, ok?”.
Cold comfort.
It’s too late in the day to try anything else; the light is fading in a country that I’m a stranger to.
*Gotta go.*
My plan was to head straight to the capital - *Monrovia* - but the folks at Immigration told me I wouldn’t make it there by sunset. They also advised me that "riding around Monrovia in the dark is a very bad idea..." So I settle on a seaside village named Robertsport, which is just a fraction closer to the border.
I want to get Liberia done like a band-aid, just rip the bloody thing off and have it over and done with.
---
I'm only a stone's throw out of the border post. *Checkpoint.*
Bloody... *shit!*
If this is any indication of the regularity of checkpoints in this country then I'm fucked; there's absolutely no way I'll get through without the right paperwork...
Even if I do make it, I'm not going to handle shitting my pants at *every, single, checkpoint*.
If Uncle Sam was in front of me I'd fuckin throttle him.
They make me stop; the road is barred with a rope. And armed guards.
I head to a building off to the side of the road. It's oddly busy for a checkpoint.
I’m *shitting* it.
Please, *please* just go for the passport. *Just the passport.* I don’t have the time or energy to argue...
“Papers”.
I give the guy my passport and nothing else. He writes down my details in a ledger book and tells me I can go.
Thank *fuck.*
I tear out of there.
Launching down some very decent tarmac at a fair clip.
Nothing to see but palm plantations.
No villages, people. No green. Just row upon row upon perfect row of stunted palm trees.
It's getting darker by the minute...
---
At the turnoff for Robertsport the tarmac changes to red dirt road.
I’ve still got fifty fucking clicks to cover.
It's getting *late*. I do *not* want to be out after dark here...
I hammer it.
I know I’m going way too fast; too fast for my skill level, the road conditions, my brain's current fuzziness, that darkness... I know I'm asking for trouble.
I flog it anyway.
I want this day finished...
*Blink.*
I hit something.
I go flying off the road.
I shit my pants, smash over some shrubs.
Get control.
Lurch back onto the red stuff.
I swear words. All the words.
My heart is *smashing.*
I keep the hammer down; it's worth the risk. I *must* beat the light.
---
Nine hours, door to door.
I pull into Robertsport.
*Twilight.*
I'm fucked seven ways to Sunday; nothing works anymore.
I check into the first guesthouse I see and collapse into a foam mattress, surrounded in the light of a dim bulb being powered by a little, loud diesel generator.
I take a moment to reflect. *I’m in Liberia...*
Li-fuckin-beria; somewhere near the top of my "holy shit" list.
On a motorbike. *How the hell did this happen?*

## Chapter Ten
Robertsport is beautiful.
It's an echo of Freetown - half perched on the hillside of a peninsula.
Beautiful ocean on one side, a sort of wetlandish expanse on the other.
I'm staying here today. *I need a break.*
Heading into the guts of the village to grab some breakfast, I notice that the building-material-of-choice has changed; from mud huts and thatched roofs to corrugated iron *everything*.
It must’ve seemed like a good idea at the time...
None of it has stood up to time itself thought...
The whole village has a rusted, derelict, seen-better-days feel to it. 
Something that hasn’t changed is the love of Celine Dion... Honestly, just, *what??*
I listen to "My Heart Will Go On" while I get down a big breakfast of rice, beans and fish.
Time. To. Wander...
---
I accidentally run into the local fish market, down by the banks of the wetlands. Everyone is firing up huge smoking vats made out of, you guessed it, corrugated iron, in preparation for the fishing boats coming back.
While they wait some are working, some are chilling and some are dancing to the usual Africa pop music garbage that’s starting to drive me insane. So terrible and catchy all at once. It’s the same three or four songs, everywhere I go, all the time (except for Celine, of course).
It's *maddening.*
Anyway, one of the young dancers has baby strapped to her back, like, a baby-baby. Tiny little thing. The mum's dancing like a maniac. The baby's head is lolling and rolling around all over the place. It's fast asleep. Either that or it’s dead... Bloody hell. I want to step in and say something, because the mum can’t see what’s happening, what, with the kid *behind* her and all... But how is that my place? No one else seems to mind, or think that it's weird...
It’s something that I have noticed before, that they aren’t particularly precious about their infant kids in this part of the world; they just strap them onto their backs and life goes on as usual. And the kids; you never hear a peep from them, let alone crying. They just sit there in their little makeshift sling, like little baby koalas, head poking out one end and their tiny little feet poking out at the mum’s sides, eyes wide open, happy to watch the world go by. Like contented tiny yogis.
Something to learn there, I think... Yet would I do the same if I had kids? *Fuck no.*
*Anyway,* the fishing boats are coming in; big colourful wooden pirogues, they fly massive flags of all different designs. The fishermen’s clothes are hanging out to dry on lines strung up to the flag pole.
It’s like a Liberian mardi gras, and these are the floats, powered along by tiny little outboard motors.
Word around the traps is that it was a pretty average day for fishing. Could've fooled me; there’s a *shitload* of fish being offloaded.
The younger fishermen are still bubbly enough after their morning's work to have a chat.
There's a deal though; they'll have a chat, but only if I take their photo doing gangster poses in front of the boat...
I'll make that deal.
One of the fishermen is telling me about the work, and I’m following him, but then he suddenly switches to Creole, and I'm completely lost.
The official language in Liberia *is* English, but amongst themselves they - like the Sierra Leoneans - speak a “Creole”. Creole is its own language, but it could probably be better thought of like a dialect of English; kind of like English words with a lot of slang phrasing and words thrown in. I can *hear* the words, but I can never make any meaning out of it. Kind of like talking to a Jamaican, but impossible.
I apologise to the fisherman, and tell him I don't understand Creole *yet.*
He gives me a blank look.
"I was speaking English..."
"You didn't change to Creole halfway??"
"No..."
Fuck! More offence.
I apologise profusely.
How embarrassing.
Fuck me I could do with some subtitles...
I extricate myself as subtly as possible, and make a beeline to the beach at the tip of the peninsula to watch the day go by.

## Chapter Eleven
Monrovia.
Fucking, *Monrovia.*
As I hit the edge of the city's sprawl my head’s churning up with all of the “what if’s” of how this could all go very wrong.
The ride in has been fine; good tarmac, nothing but palm plantations as far as the eye can see. In each village on the way here there were young women walking around topless, completely covered in white paint.
Yeah, so there’s *that*...
Anyway. In a twinkling, Monrovia goes from empty to fuckin *gridlock.*
It's midday; bright, hot and sunny.
I can’t believe they have traffic lights... And they *work*! I can't remember the last time I saw traffic lights...
I'm sitting on a red, admiring the lights when someone blows a fucking whistle right in my ear.
“Papers!!”
Fuck a duck! I nearly jumped off the bike... Scared the absolute *shit* out of me.
It's a cop...
Where the hell did he sneak up from??
And why is he asking me for papers? These are traffic lights, not *checkpoints!*
Alright, douchebag. You want my papers? You got them. But you’re getting them right here, *and I ain’t moving.*
I hand him my UK registration papers. He looks them over and he’s obviously a bit confused, and none too happy.
*These are not the papers he was expecting.*
The lights go green.
Pure vitriol pours out of every car stuck behind me.
*The noise!*
The blaring cacophony is exactly what I was hoping for and... result! he hands me back my rego and tersely waves me on!
*Victory!*
I head in deeper and deeper into the city, till I find what feels like the guts of the town.
Time to find somewhere to shack up.
There's not a shitload of options jumping out at me...
A dingy looking motel is the only obvious thing... I park up and ask the lads milled around out front if they could watch my bike for a tick.
Stepping into the motel, my eyes won't adjust to the darkness... I shuffle in, blind, till I can make out someone's outline.
No, it's a group...
*Fuck it's dark in here...*
"Hi..." I shake hands with the outlines. "Do you have any rooms available?"
"What?"
"Do you have a room for the night?"
"How many hours?"
"Hours? Uh, no, not hours. The night."
"What time will you come?"
"What time will I come?? I'm here now. *Now?*"
"Mmmmmmm, I don't know this..."
*What the fuck's going on here??* Are these guys thick in the head?
"I don't understand - You don't know how much a room costs for a night?"
"No, only hours."
"Well... Ok: What would it cost me, if I came here now - right now - and then left, tomorrow? And can I see a room?"
They take me off towards the rooms while they do the math; 24 times the hourly rate...
It's too much. I punch them down to 1000 Liberian dollars - about fifteen bucks.
I see the room... It looks *seedy.*
"Can I keep my motorbike inside?"
"You can keep it out on the street, it will be safe"
I can’t help but laugh.
Fuck that. I'm worried about it out there right now, in broad daylight...
"Nah I need it inside, do you have space?"
"No, no, outside is safe. No embarrassment."
"What's with this 'no embarrassment'?.. I can't have it inside? Anywhere?"
"Mmmmmmm no. There is nowhere."
That's a deal breaker.
The shadowy outlines have become three young blokes. I shake their hands. "Ok, thanks anyway."
On the way out I walk past a front room that I didn't even see on the way in. I get a flash of a glimpse inside as I reach for the door.
Empty, except for a handful of women, there are shiny sequins, they're sitting, facing my direction, saying nothing.
I open the door to the blinding light of the outside and step through.
Wait... Is this a fucking *brothel???*
"Cheeses fucking *Christ.*"
I squint, put on my sunglasses. The bike's still there.
*I need a shower.*
Fuck me... Imagine if they had've let me have the bike inside, I would have said yes...
Ugh...
I thank the guys out the front for watching the bike. One of them gives me a knowing wink.
*Get me the fuck out of here.*
---
Second place, the same question: *how many hours.*
The place after that, *the same again.*
*Yuck.*
I ride around in the hot, chaotic traffic for an hour or so. Looking.
I find the perfect place.
A clean yet pretty spartan hotel. They even have a security guard out front.
The cheapest room they have is 120.
Not Liberian dollars... *U.S.* dollars.
Deal breaker.
I start to get panicky. I can feel it; things aren't looking good.
*I'm over it.*
I find the least brothelly brothel; they charge both by the hour *and* by the night.
*Classy.*
$20 for an overnighter, $5 for a "short stay".
The roll of condoms on your pillow is included in the price.
I'm assuming that this place is less of a brothel and more of a "place you fuck your mistress" type thing.
Or, this is where you bring the hooker picked up on the street... In any case, there are no women here, *yet...*
I don't want to think about it.
They'll let me keep the bike in one of their spare rooms inside.
I haggle 25% off the price and take it. So long as the bike is safe, it'll be ok.
It's not forever.
---
My room is an absolute shocker.
Grim.
Concrete everything, dimly lit by a single bulb that plugs into an electrical socket near the floor by the door, so the room is lit up from below.
Everything casts a shadow.
There’s no window, but rather a tiny grate in the wall that makes me feel like I’m in jail.
Jail would probably be cleaner...
The mattress is thick - double the thickness of a normal mattress - and made of weak, yellowing foam. When I lie in it it engulfs me. Completely. Like I'm *in* it, not on it..
Like I'm drowning. Claustrophobic.
The pillows are questionable.
They smell...
I don't want to think too much about any of it.
The bathroom is its own separate room. There's no door, just a human sized hole in the concrete. It catches none of the light from the globe on the floor.
It's dark and wet. It feels like there are things growing in here...
There is a toilet with no seat, and no flush, and a big barrel of water with a bucket floating around in it.
A small hole in the concrete floor is the drain.
I can smell that cockroaches are close-by (a skill I've learned on the journey). But I can’t see them. It's too dark.
Back to the bedroom, it's secured from the hall with a flimsy wooden door with a tiny latch, smaller than my thumb, and a tiny padlock to go it with.
The latch is held in place by a couple of wood nails.
It is - *by far* - the worst value place I’ve ever made myself stay in.
I leave.
---
First things first: *Cash.*
Liberia has two currencies: The Liberian dollar and the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is actually an official currency here, and you can get them out at cash machines.
This is an exciting development for me, and a great chance to pick up some “break-in-case-of-emergency” currency; my first easy shot at doing this since I got cleaned out in Dakar...
The first ATM I try makes that delightful crunching sound as it counts the notes, and spits out a thousand dollars’ worth of the crispiest, freshest U.S. dollars you’ve ever seen.
Fuck I love it when things *just work.*
I pocket the wad in a hurry and scurry back to my den, wary of anyone who looks at me twice.
Juicy safety net: Tick.
Time. To. Wander.
---
I head to the markets for the obligatory look at “a day in the life of a Monrovian”. The market on the riverside is par-for-the-course; in just the same vein as all the other places I’ve been. But the difference here is in the *density* of it. Markets are normally packed and bustling, but this is just crazy. It’s like being in a hot, sweaty mosh pit. Half the market is roofed, in a sprawling duck-your-head shantytown. It's dim, stifling, and not too inviting. The other half is open to the blazing sunshine, and the sellers and traders do their thing from under the shade of huge umbrellas. From a distance it looks like a jam packed day at the beach.
I’m much too late for lunch and finding chop is a struggle; all the big mammas are gone.
After a long time looking I finally find someone selling some food. Both the big mamma and the food look pretty damn questionable... She’s missing a lot of teeth, but I’m more worried about the food; looks like shit... I won’t be the only one sitting on the bench though, as there are five young girls all chowing down on the same bowl of rice, cassava leaves, and the most mysterious of mystery meats. It's a brown curry sort of thing that’s clearly gone horribly wrong. Amongst all the solid stuff I can’t see anything resembling something I would call “meat”.
So, it's either this, or go hungry...
*Beggars can’t be choosers.*
I grab a bowl and chow down the grisly brown stuff.
There's so much gristle to chew through that my jaw hurts. I have a sneaking suspicious that everything I'm seagulling down the hatch won't be staying there for long... I ask the big mamma how much it costs to rent the food instead of buying it. She misses the joke, thank god.
Once I’m done committing hara-kiri, I swap sweat with a thousand strangers to get back out of the market and into the city.
*I'm wet.*
Fuckin *rank.*
I dry out a bit as I walk around town, and it *is* a proper city; it's got business towers, high-rise buildings and everything. The odd thing about it though is that half of it is completely derelict. Abandoned.
I can tell that once-upon-a-time this place must've been doing pretty well; I can see the extent of foreign investment in the multitude of old and washed up buildings with foreign words on them - all untouched in years - abandoned when the foreigners all got the fuck out of here at the outbreak of war.
No one came back, it seems.
It’s an eerily fascinating walk.
I come across an absolute doozy. A big, ten story, beige coloured tower. It looks like it was abandoned in the finishing stages of construction. All of the windows are missing, it looks dishevelled, with weird black pockmarks covering it all over. The whole tower's surrounded by barbed wire.
I get to talking with a nearby security guard and ask what the building is. Apparently, the Chinese were nearly done building it as a bank, and then dropped it like it’s hot when things got messy. 
"Ah, ok. What are all those weird marks?"
"Bullets."
"Bullets!? As in bullet *holes*??"
"Yes, these are where people shoot the building."
"Shit... All of them?"
"Yes, all bullets."
They're *everywhere*
The whole ex-war-zone thing just got *very* real.
A local bloke - who seems friendly enough - overhears our conversation and tells me he’ll take me in and show me around.
"O-kaay..."
We bypass the barbed wire and walk into the building. It's been overtaken by squatters. Nothing but bare concrete walls and pillars and people. I get a fair few confused looks, which is probably fair enough.
There are bullet holes in here too...
We walk a few floors, and then I want to get out. I don't feel at ease in here... There's something about those looks...
I thank my guide and head out, back to the streets and open sunshine.
---
I'm seeing bullet holes everywhere I look now.
They're *everywhere.*
I wonder how hard it would be for the locals to simply fill them in, but they’ve obviously got more important things to do, which I guess is fair enough, but leaving them there for *decades*?
It's weird; if it were me I'd paste them over just to stop being reminded of the war. Right?
I walk the streets for a few hundred meters till I get to the coast.
I can’t believe my eyes.
Beautiful clean sand, blue water, and a beautiful surf break where the big swell is pumping up massive waves.
I realise that my mouth is open...
"Where the fuck...?"
It's reeking hot, and a mere stone's throw away people are climbing over each other for space, yet there's hardly a soul on the sand.
*Am I missing something here?*
I feel like I've crossed into some alternate universe.
Or, the same universe, but back in time.
I walk the beach, looking for anyone who might be renting a surfboard.
I walk a few clicks down the beach till I hit a river barring my route; a *river* of absolute filth. Sludge and excrement from who-knows-where. It's *thick*. Oozing its way out into the sea. I can actually *see* human shit in it. Revolting.
Fucking *ruined*.
I stop looking for a surfboard.
---
I get back to the market quarter as the light's getting a bit dim. 
Bullet holes or no bullet holes, I can’t believe how safe and relaxed I’ve felt walking the city streets.
Sure, I’m paying attention to what’s been going on - to not do that would be thick - but, by and large, I've been happily walking about, and no one’s been giving me the slightest bit of grief.
No harassing, nothing threatening, just quite a bit of staring. That’s all.
That said, I’ve been told by a number of people not to be out after dark... I’m not about to tempt fate and loiter about as the sun sets.
That means quick chow and then double-time it back to the demi-brothel.
Rush home before the zombies come out.
Seafood is on the menu tonight. I manage to get a whole fish off one of the big mammas for 160 Liberian dollars, which is about $2.50.
The Liberian bank notes are so filthy and worn that it’s hard to distinguish the amounts; it's just dirty, old paper. And wet; they have a wet dampness to them. Moist. It’s disgusting.
But it's legal tender, and it'll get me a whole fish.
I make like a local and eat it my hands, and it’s pretty good.
I double-time it back to the hovel as the light fades.

## Chapter Twelve
Delirium.
Sweat.
Boiling fever.
Half-waking, half-sleeping, restless.
Raving.
Demented.
Swallowed by the bed. Lying in my own sweat. Burning up.
*Trapped.*
---
Sunrise. At last.
Deliverance.
I've been wishing for it all night.
I've never felt worse.
The first rays of sunlight through my prison grating are greeted by an urgent need to use the facilities.
I crap like a tap.
Fucking *great*.
So. I’m sick. Again. In this shithole.
Sick, but not really surprised; was it mystery meat lunch? Or the "lets touch the most filthy currency in the world and then eat some fish with same hands" dinner.
Probably both.
---
It takes hours to clear the decks... Sitting, slumped, in that dark horror of a bathroom.
I get the feeling it might be safe enough to venture out. I feel like shit, but so what? I just want to get my visas and get going.
I head out boldly, armed and ready for the embassies. Every ounce of my consciousness focused inwards, watching like a hawk for signs of potential disaster. A zen monk ain't got shit on my level of inner watchfulness.
Monrovia is a ghost town.
There *was* a zombie apocalypse...
*Have I missed something again?* Yesterday, there was no such thing as “personal space”, today I'm alone. Eerily so.
When I finally do find someone on the street - alive - I find out that today is the national day for honouring the dead.
*“Declaration Day”*.
No work, no markets, no nothing.
Well, so much for getting visas...
Even though I'm crook, I know that I have to eat something. The only thing I can find after half an hour of looking around is a couple of doughnuts and a banana. Breakfast of champions.
I’ve got nothing better to do than to check out the embassies - I don't want to spend the day in the demi-brothel if I can help it.
After a few hours of taxi’s and bad directions I find the embassies for both Ivory Coast and Ghana. Both shut. G-R-E-A-T.
It's weird, I always thought that Ivory Coast was a name for, y'know, a coast, not a country...
---
In the afternoon I start burping massive, long burps. They taste like omelettes...
*Omelettes!*
I haven’t eaten an omelette or anything eggy in a long time. A *really* long time. That’s probably not good.
Over the course of the day the omelette graduates into that familiar, citrus-y taste from Senegal. 
*Tangy.*
Fucking *great.*
I know the drill...
I head to my brothel abode and wait.
My stomach is bloated and distended out far enough that I’m sure I must look like an albino Biafran.
Finally the nausea comes and I’ve learnt my lesson from the past; *resistance is futile.*
Everything comes out looking like it did when it went in.
I need to chew more.
*Bloody hell.*
It’s like my stomach doesn’t do digestion anymore, it just temporary stores food and water.
Lovely.
I brush my teeth to get that taste out of my mouth and - I swear to god - the toothpaste isn’t real toothpaste. The packaging looks legit; it says *Colgate*. But this ain’t toothpaste.
Fails all round.
---
Throughout the night I’m most often sitting. Sometimes kneeling. Seldom lying. Always close to *the can.*
When I do get the chance to rest it’s that same fucking bitch of a delirious sleep as last night, which I reckon is worse than being awake.
Fuck this is miserable.
---
The sun finally rises and there’s a little leprechaun swinging a hammer in my brain in time with my heartbeat.
Donk.. Donk.. Donk..
I’ve gotta remember, no one’s making me do this...
It’s hard to indulge in self-pity when there's no one else to blame.
Visas.
Yes.
Today’s the day.
---
I retrace my tracks from yesterday and, thank god, the Ivory Coast / Cote d’Ivoire embassy or consulate or whatever is open. Huzzah.
I *need* this visa; if they won't let me into Cote d'Ivoire, I can't really leave Liberia. At least not in that direction...
I fill out the forms, have a chat with the ambassador or consular or whoever he is.
I walk out half an hour later with a three month visa stuck in my passport. $70 and no hassle. Easiest visa I've ever picked up.
Next go is the “Hail Mary” chuck at the problem child; Ghana.
I’m ready for the “no, no, no - you have to be a resident” shit and I don’t care; Cote d’Ivoire will do for now and I can kick the Ghana can a little ways down the road.
I get through some pretty locked down security just to get into the Ghana embassy compound, and head into a room that feels like a doctor’s waiting room. Behind a sheet of thick perspex is a man at a desk. Does Ghana have a lot of enemies? Must do. Anyway. I ask about a visa.
"Are you a resident of Liberia?"
Here we go again...
"No."
"Do you have an entrance stamp in your passport for Liberia?"
"Uh, yes... Of course..."
"Ok. That will do."
Oh. *Shit yeah.* Jackpot baby!
He wants *four* photocopies of practically every piece of paper that I own, two references from two Ghanaian citizens and a “mission statement” from me; explaining what my purpose is and why I should be granted a visa.
I think I can manage that.
---
Four hours later and I’ve got all that paperwork. I’ve fabricated a couple of references from out of a guidebook for Ghana, complete with names, phone numbers and addresses. For the "mission statement" I’ve written up the whole “I’m riding a bike through Africa” thing, and greased on that I'm really looking forward to the Ghanaian culture.
It works.
70 dollars later and I’m the stoked owner of a 90 day Ghanain visa.
You fuckin ripper!
I spend whats left of the afternoon, doing "life admin".
Turns out JB broke something on his bike on the way out of Freetown and had to double back to get it repaired, so I'm actually well ahead of him now. Which is good; he's a much better chance to catch up to me before Nigeria than me catching up with him.

## Chapter Thirteen
I’m done with Monrovia.
So done.
Another night spent on *the can* in that fucking filthy cave of a bathroom in this shitpile of a demi-brothel.
I dare not eat anything substantial. Biscuits and bananas are about all I can stomach.
As if I didn't look shit enough already, all of my burnt skin from 'River No.2 Beach' has decided it’s going to flake off, so now my whole body and face look poxy.
Lovely.
Being crook is exhausting, and the lack of food, energy and sleep is starting to show.
I don’t really care. I just want to get out of here.
I head out for breakfast. It's another public holiday... I don’t know what for and I don’t particularly give a shit; all this means to me is that there won’t be any breakfast this morning.
And that’s not good.
I feel totally spent and the day hasn’t even started yet. I drag my feet when I walk. I'm all stooped over and old looking.
I really don't want to, but I reckon it’s probably a good idea to stay for one more night. If there’s no food in Monrovia, then what chance do I have of getting lunch on the road? And what if the next stop, *Buchannan*, is all closed up too? What about accommodation? What about petrol? Will the petrol stations be open on a public holiday?
Who cares.
*I just can't do it anymore.*
I’ve got to get out of here. I don’t care if I have a shit day of it, I want out. I refuse to spend another night in this shithole.
Loading the bike takes everything I have left.
I ride out.
So long, Monrovia, you’ve been bloody awful.
---
The city is covered in an eerie, dense fog. It’s morning, but not that early, and regardless of the time, this is the first I’ve ever seen fog in Africa.
Ominous.
I’m no weatherman, but what I’m taking from it is that fog + time = rain, and rain + dirt roads = mud, and mud does not equal fun. In fact, just plain old rain does not equal fun on a motorbike; not to mention that my saddlebags are so beaten up they’d be about as waterproof as a sieve.
I sit at a set of traffic lights, still technically inside Monrovia. I muse over the chance of a wet-season coming soon.
Two policemen pop up out of nowhere, right in my fucking face.
“Papers, *now*!!”
I jump in my seat.
They’re in *full* riot gear.
All in black.
They look like an African SWAT team.
Shields, armoured body gear, the whole nine yards.
They’ve come from a police post at the side of road that I didn’t spot coming into the red light. There's a handful of hardcore cops milling about over there, watching.
I leave the bike running and hand them my UK rego papers; it's all I've got.
They’re as confused about these as everyone else is when I hand them over; no one seems to ever be sure what exactly they’re looking at. But it looks *very* official...
“Where is your permit?”
My mate Uncle Sam has fucked me.
The lights go green. And all the cars backed up behind me go fucking berserk. Beautiful.
“This is my permit. See?”
“No. You are under arrest.”
Bam! The other cop - the short one - grabs my keys out of the ignition, killing the bike, and shoves them in his pocket in one swift movement.
“Oi! Hey! Give those back!”
“No! You are under arrest!”
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
“No... No I’m not. I’m not under arrest. Why do you think I’m under arrest? What for?”
“You have no permit, you are under arrest!”
This short one seems to be a little dim...
"Bring the bike over here", the tall one gestures at the side of the road. The cars behind me are going apeshit; they’ve missed the green light...
What choice do I have? Gotta do it.
Leverage lost, I try the usual arguments that the registration is fine, I don’t need a permit. I’m allowed to be here. “You go and ask Uncle Sam, the boss-man at the border, *big* boss-man, you ask him, the boss-man, he says 'No embarrassment', you ask!”
That throws them...
The short one, a little baffled, picks up his go-to line “You are under arrest! Yes, embarrassment!”
I’m too tired; my thick brain can't come up with anything clever...
A small, plain clothed man comes up to me from out of a growing crowd on the sidewalk, and starts telling *me* what the problem is.
*Who the fuck is this guy??*
According to him, it's not a problem that I don't have a temporary import permit for the bike. No. *The problem* is that motorbikes aren't allowed on this road without a *special* permit.
*What?!*
“Who are you??” I ask him. I'm totally out of patience. “Are you the police?? Huh??”
To that he whips out an ID card.
I lean in and squint. I’m talking to... *Colonel Williams* of Liberian fucking Immigration.
*What???*
Am I supposed to fucking believe that? That a *Colonel* just happened to be passing by? On foot?
I smell a rat.
The fattest of rats.
This is a stitch up. It’s gotta be...
But the ID, well, it *does* look legit...
I take him on face value, "I don't get it. It's a road. I shouldn't need a permit."
"Do you see any other motorbikes on this road? Eh? No. And look," the Colonel points to the corner of the intersection "you see all those scooter taxis, they wait there, off the main road, because they don't have a permit"
There's a handful of scooters with riders just sitting on them, doing nothing, going nowhere on the corner of the main drag...
While I look at that, the riot police have pulled over some other poor bastard on two wheels.
He looks *terrified.*
He frantically pulls out from under his shirt a laminated A4 sheet of paper that is roped around his neck.
I’m not making it up; it's an enormous permit, laminated, hung from around his neck, stuffed down his shirt.
I take a closer look.
It looks legit. Some sort of permission granted for using a scooter or motorcycle on the main road. Stamps and everything.
I scan my memory for motorbikes I’ve seen on this street in Monrovia. Not a single one comes to mind. And it's Africa, they should be everywhere...
"You are under arrest!!"
Fuck. That might be right...
No one ever told me about this. How the fuck was I supposed to know?
Ugh.
I’m so *tired.*
“Can I have my keys back?”
“You are under arrest!”
It’s time to change tack, and fast.
“Hey guys, ummm, do you know how I can get to Buchannan? Which way is it, you know, without using the wrong roads? Is it down this way?”
It’s a dumb thing to ask and completely off topic.
*Everyone* wants to help me with directions. They all start talking over each other, finishing each other’s sentences to explain it to me. I’m getting advice from tall cop, short cop and my mate the Colonel. Even passer-by’s are throwing in their two cents. They're giving me directions on how to get *all the way* to Buchannan, like, 150 clicks worth of directions.
*This is going to work.*
I mirror back to them their own directions, and everyone’s all smiles and nodding and thumbs up.
“Great, thank you so much guys, I really appreciate it. Can I grab my keys?”
Short n dim actually gives me my keys back! This is going to work! What a gambit!!
“Thanks again!”
I fire up the bike and it roars to life. I can *see* the moment it snaps everybody out of their well-wishing hypnosis they were under.
“You are under arrest!!”
Arrrrghh, *fuck*!!
So friggin close!
“Come on man, I’m just a simple traveller, how am I supposed to know about this, it was an honest mistake. Just let me off this time. Give me a break.”
I look pleadingly to my mate the Colonel, who I’ve decided is on my team, but even he seems to be out of his league, or at least out of his jurisdiction: This is a police matter, and the Colonel of Immigration doesn't hold court here, it seems.
He shrugs his shoulders and wishes me good luck and off he goes, walking back into the mob that's formed; the one guy in my corner and I’ve lost him.
The riot cops tell me to go and park over on the other side of the road next to their checkpoint, where the rest of the hard looking cops are.
I’m so hungry.
I wonder if I threw up all over everyone if they’d let me leave, or if that would make things worse.
Or maybe I could crap my pants.
I reckon I could do either of the two, on cue. *Right now.*
They’d *definitely* let me go if I squirted brown everywhere. *Pronto.*
"We are taking the bags, and the bike. You are going to prison. You are under arrest." Tall cop says it, with solemn finality.
Nothing happens. I just sit and on the bike and wait.
Hunger and exhaustion start to turn the vice.
The mob have crossed the road to continue to gawk, like this is some sort of spectator sport.
The riot cops tell them to move on, but they refuse, shouting at the cops, who are shouting back.
The cops start shoving people. The people shove back.
Batons are brandished, the shouting ratchets.
What the *fuck* is going on??
I’m shitting it. I need to get the fuck out of here...
The mob scuffles with the cops.
Everyone's *screaming.*
One of the cop cracks a bloke on the arm with a baton, and the mob scatters; fucking bolts for it as the cops chase them off.
I’m at the end of my tether.
Either they'll put me in prison, or they want a monster bribe.
What would I pay to get out of here? The sky’s the limit.
I'll pay all I've got, and I've got all that money that I took out just a few days ago. An even thousand. I'd give it all just to leave.
How do I even start that conversation? I haven’t the slightest idea and my brain isn't fucking working right.
I’ve never done this shit before.
What worries me the most about suggesting a bribe is that it could be used as further leverage against me, digging me deeper into the hole. I don't want another charge on the rap sheet...
I decide to do nothing; it seems the least worst option.
I'm actually pretty proud of myself for my outer composure; despite being ready to meltdown on the inside, on the outside I must look bored.
I really hope I do.
---
I've been at the lights for maybe half an hour now, all up. I haven't gotten off the bike once, for fear that they'll take it off me.
A new cop comes up to me, one I haven’t talked to before, a young man, but from the looks of him he might be the one in charge here...
“You’re under arrest.”
I shake his hand.
"Ugh."
I wait for him to go on.
“You are under arrest, yes? We are taking your everything, yes? And you are going to go to a Liberian prison for six months, yes? Liberia prisons are not a nice place. Very bad. Yes?”
I think he's finished...
“Six months is a long time for a minor traffic offence don’t you reckon?”
“Yes” he nods his head, solemnly, “a very long time. Yes. *Or*, you can pay a fine now.”
And *there* it is.
“Ok. What’s the fine?”
“Yes...” he thinks about it.
*This is it.*
“Fifty! Fifty *American*, dollars!”
I keep my hysteria in check. *Just...*
I want to laugh and cry and slap this dickhead in the face. All at once.
All this - all of this tension and pant-shitting terror and freak out and dread and anxiety - all of it, for fifty measly bucks.
I almost feel short changed... I raise my eyebrows.
“Whoa! Fifty!? That's a lot!!" I shake my hands like they're hot. "I have a twenty? I have it here, now.”
He thinks about it. “Yes. Ok.”
*Unbelievable.*
My first bare-faced bribe in Africa.
I dig into my secret money pocket inside my leather jacket - very careful not to reveal too much - and dig a twenty dollar note out of a wad of a thousand.
He tells me not to pay the fine here, but around the corner in the next street, out of sight of the checkpoint.
*Dodgy.*
"You let me on the bike and we go together."
“Nah mate. You can walk.”
I follow him for a while and then go ahead to park the bike out of the line of sight of the checkpoint.
I stop the bike and I'm immediately boxed in tightly by three scooters.
"Oi! What the..!?"
One has blocked my path in front, another blocked my path behind, and a third pulls up alongside me, pinning me to the gutter. The dickhead cop is sitting on the back. 
All of them are grinning at me.
*Mugs.*
They must've thought I was trying to make a getaway...
*Unnecessary.*
I give the cop the twenty bucks, and his scooter rider guns it down the street, tearing away from the police checkpoint. The prick on the back is laughing.
Joke's on you, ya spud.
I go to leave in the hole they've made to my right, but the guy on the scooter in front of me moves his scooter back to block my path. *Grinning.*
I'm going to use my last ounce of strength to deck him...
I rock back, change direction, and ride off.
Even though I know it's over I feel like I'm fleeing the scene.
---
The damage was nothing. In truth, it's a victory if ever there was one, but it’s left me feeling frazzled and vulnerable.
Unsafe.
I hate being at the whim of these bastards. *Hate* it. It makes me feel like a hunted animal, makes me edgy. Tense.
After flying through the busy streets - spending more time than is safe with my eyes on my mirrors, looking for a chaser - I finally start breathing normally again, and decide to take a break.
I’m starving.
I pull over where I see a lady selling the biggest bananas on the planet.
*That’ll do.*
The bananas are as big as my forearm. *Huge.* A banana as big as a baguette.
The lady seems a little perplexed when I ask for one; like it's an odd request, but she sells it to me anyway.
As we're changing money she just starts *screaming.*
I follow her gaze, and see a pickup truck reversing down a steep hill and over the top of my bike.
I scream.
The metal of the pickup is *shrieking* over the top of my bike.
"*Stop! Stop!!*" I run.
The driver stops the car, the bike is *way* underneath the tray.
He pauses there, unsure what to do.
"*GET OFF!! GET THE FUCK OFF!!!*"
This is it. It’s all over. He’s just fucked my bike.
He puts the pickup into first gear, fucks up the hill start and rolls back further, screeching over my bike.
I scream again.
I can do nothing.
The pickup finally moves forward to more screeching of metal on metal.
My bike...
It’s all too much. I'm making noisy breaths.
*I want to go home.*
The bike is still, somehow, on its wheels, but pushed way over to one side, warping the kickstand. On the side that took the contact the metal crashbar has been bent all the way back so that it’s pinned against the side of the bike and the exhaust. The tank has a ding in the bottom of it, *inches* from the motor.
It's taken off paint.
I keep looking.
*"Is that it??"*
That’s it.
The driver has jumped out of the pickup and is absolutely shitting it. I would be too; I'm fucking *furious*. He's apologising profusely. I can’t even really hear him; I’m too busy swearing. Not at him. Just at everything. I don’t even know what I’m really saying anymore. Just randomly walking about, nonsensically but profusely venting my spleen.
It feels better.
This morning has been more than I can deal with.
The exhaustion's in my bones now.
*All I wanted was a banana.* Is that too much to ask?
I give the kickstand and the crashbar a good kicking to re-align them a little, and go back and get my banana off the screaming lady.
I peel it, and the thin outer layer of the peel comes ripping off like sticky tape, leaving all the bulk of the peel behind.
*Under-fucking-ripe.*
I’m gonna cry.
I rip the whole thing apart with my hands and nails like an angry monkey might. Finally, banana.
I try to take a bite but it’s impossible, it’s so tough and hard that I can’t even gnaw off a piece with my back teeth like a rat.
I hate this banana.
The screaming has brought in another huge mob, and they're all watching me with perplexed looks on their faces.
*I give up.*
I ask it if someone would like my banana. A man steps forward and takes the mangled, half-chewed banana off me.
I’m fucking *off.*
---
The derelict shantytowns become nothing but squat palm plantations.
It's been an hour.
No people. No food.
It’s the hottest, most stifling, most humid day I’ve had on the whole trip. The sun is *brutal*, and there's absolutely zero shade.
Being crook, I was dehydrated before I even started.
It feels like my bodys got nothing left.
I’m riding around using only half a brain; if that.
In the distance, I see a tiny village.
There's a shack. *They're selling food.*
Sandwiches.
I hoover an egg and mayo sandwich, *inhale it.*
It's the second best thing I've ever eaten.
I hope it stays with me...
---
Back on the bike and leaving the village.
Off in the distance I spot a checkpoint. I get a cold dump of adrenaline I didn't ask for.
I can't. I *can't*...
I'm terrified.
I just can't do it again.
Approaching it, I'm looking for a way to get past without stopping.
There’s a roped bunting that’s barring the road, stopping cars, and there are police on the road.
I slow right down and go off the side of the road, down the shoulder and into the dirt in a deeply dug out trench.
I pass under the bunting, and I'm through to the other side.
The shoulder back up to the road is too steep for me to climb, and up ahead the trench comes to a dead end.
*Stuck.*
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
I’ve got no choice; I have to turn around and make my way back to where I came from.
Back past the bunting, back up the shoulder, back onto the road, all under the watchful eyes of the cops, who haven't missed a moment of me trying to dodge them.
Caught red handed.
Once I'm back up on the road, one of the police unhooks the rope and gestures for me to park up the bike on the other side.
I ride slowly, casually past the cop holding the rope, and then gun it.
*Flee.*
Even through my helmet and the roar of the bike I can hear the cops losing their shit behind me, and I can see them wigging out in my mirrors.
I get far enough down the road to know I’m not being chased - and that I can't be shot - and I start breathing again.
It might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever done.
It’s the sort of blatantly retarded thing that could land you in the deepest of shit. *Or worse...*

## Chapter Fourteen
Buchannan.
No more checkpoints. Uneventful, straight tarmac all the way.
I’m starting to really get the shits with the bike; the oil level indicator or “sight glass”, which lets you look into the sump to see the oil level is driving me nuts; I’ll do identical oil level tests on perfectly level road, and one test will show that the oil sump is brimming full, the next will show that it’s bone dry.
I’ve got fuck all idea what the true, correct reading is, and so I don’t know if it’s overfull or if it’s empty or if it’s Goldilocks. And there’s oil hosing out of the motor *all the time*.
I *need* to know how much oil is left. It scares me.
Buchanan's an unremarkable port hole. I'd like to ride further, but I can't.
After shacking up in a shitty hotel (that's *not* a brothel) I go walkabout, and chat to as many people as I can about where I should go next.
*Harper.*
Two hundred clicks straight down the coast.
There are two routes: a straight line, or, a 600km inland detour.
All my maps have the straight road dead-ending at a river...
Sketchy.
And no one can tell me if there are bridges or canoes there to get me to the other side.
The 600km detour is a sure thing; with multiple people confirming it's do-able.
I’m not thrilled about turning a one day trip into a three day fuckabout.
I find a tin shack restaurant and continue my enquiries over lunch, which is mysterious meats in some sort of stew with rice.
Pretty gnarly stuff. Flies everywhere. But it’s popular with the locals so it’s popular with me.
---
Maybe not so popular...
As I lie in bed for a siesta my guts are roiling. They won't let me sleep.
I don't know if it's lunch, or just a Monrovian hangover.
I feel *green* with nausea.
I could easily chuck it all up - anytime I want - and send myself back to square one. But this feels important. I don't think I will manage if I chuck up another day's food; I'll just stop working.
So I hold it down, and give it a chance to ingest *something*.
---
Morning.
I've kept it down so far, but I've got tangy burps, and I don't know how long I can hold out.
My guts are moving in a way that indicates something violent is imminent. And I don’t mean throwing up either...
I get up and look in the mirror.
I look like I should, I guess, which is to say I look like dogshit.
I want to stay another day in Buchannan but, more than that, I still feel an overwhelming urge to *escape*. To run away.
I ignore the warning signs, load up the bike, and roll the dice.
---
My furious gut plus the shaking of the bike start whipping up their perfect storm.
In an act of pragmatism I skip breakfast; I don’t want to give myself any more ammunition.
I leave Buchannan, and take the road for the six hundred kilometre detour.
Tarmac quickly turns into a single-laned, well-graded red dirt track.
---
Gone are the endless rows of plantations, replaced with a sparse, green forest that creeps in on the roadside.
Sometimes the trees canopy over the track to give some shade, sometimes I'm open to the cloudy sky above.
There's the very seldom village, and in each village there are young topless women, painted white.
I hardly notice any of this.
I’m a man on a mission.
Eyes on the prize as I chop down the road, destroying the serenity as I smash around in top gear.
I’m all negativity; flying in a mad rush to get to nowhere in particular.
I’m in such a hurry that the only times I ever stop are when my bowels tell me they won't wait another second. Or I’m stopped at a checkpoint... 
Never trust a fart in Africa... Or the police...
I'm not sure which I dread more.
But both turn out to be non-events; I squatted in the forest and let go of one of my top farts of all time; a spectacular ten second duration which somehow managed to stay dry, to great surprise and delight; and the checkpoint officials being all smiles and handshakes and well wishing.
No problem.
---
After about six hours in my head and two hundred clicks on the clock I find myself in a big enough small village to know I’m a good chance at finding somewhere to eat and sleep. *Saclepea*.
It's a *long* way between viable villages, so I call it a day.
An average speed of 33km/h doesn’t sound like a lot, but with breaks included *and* on a dirt road with a Royal Enfield that’s pretty good going. I’m satisfied with that.
And I didn't shit my pants, or vomit. *Not even once.*
---
*Sweet baby Cheeses*, they have a shower. My own fucking shower.
The shower rose is the size of a dinner plate.
I strip down and jump in immediately.
It feels like I'm caught in a deluge. Like I'm standing under a thundering, cool waterfall.
I could happily drown.
After an unknown amount of time I call it.
I go and lie down on my *real* mattress. With *clean* sheets.
And smile.
I get up and go take another shower.

## Chapter Fifteen
I could leap tall buildings in a single bound.
It’s incredible what a good night’s sleep and a full, settled stomach can do.
And showers; I've taken *five*.
The biggest change is between the ears.
I *can’t wait* to get on the bike.
---
*Green*.
A well graded dirt road.
I've been cruising, taking it easy, enjoying the ride, head in the clouds, soaking it all in.
Outback Liberia is jaw-droppingly *stunning*.
The track is never straight, following the contours of the land. 
The red stuff under the tyres has gone a deeper, rusty red after last night’s rains. The forest has become way, way denser since yesterday.
It's older.
Untouched.
It’s so thick that anything a few meters into the forest is lost to sight; you can only ever see as far as the next corner.
The rain has wetted the leaves, cleaned them up, and made the shades of green that much richer.
There are heavy storm clouds hovering in the sky, threatening to ruin my day. For now though they're content just shading me without pissing on the parade.
Fuck it’s beautiful.
It feels so *old*. Ancient, even. It’s got to be old growth forest; it must have taken hundreds of years for the trees to grow to this size.
I have it all to myself.
Except for the U.N., that is...
Enormous, tank like vehicles, all in white. "U.N." emblazoned in on the sides in black.
This is the shit you normally see on the news...
*Am I not supposed to be here??*
The soldiers are dressed like soldiers, except they're wearing sky blue helmets.
They’ve got big road graders, and trucks, and tractors. All perfect white.
I ride past, and they're disinterested. I actually get a couple of waves.
They're *Pakistani's*?
That's... *weird...*
---
*Checkpoint.*
I fizz a little.
I *hate* this. The confrontation. It makes me feel sick.
Fucking Uncle Sam. That bastard's ruined Liberia for me.
Roped bunting; I won't be able to get under it, or around it.
I try my best to slip around it, but by the time I’ve done that the police have woken up and come running out of their hut to stop me.
I'm not going to bolt this time...
I pull up and head into the hut like I’m told.
There’s a young bloke in uniform behind a desk.
“Papers”.
I give him my passport, which is the only document I have that he can’t poke holes in.
“Papers for the motorbike”. I give him my tattered registration papers.
He goes through the whole thing, line by line. Its two A4 pages, back and front. 80% of the info is irrelevant - "how to transfer vehicle ownership" and shit like that. He reads it all.
*Peanut.*
He gets up from his desk and heads out to my bike. He gets on hands and knees, and starts cross-checking the frame number and engine number with the rego. The engine number is 14 digits long. The frame number, 17 digits long.
Peanut is obviously on the hunt for anything not right in the paperwork that he can try to trip me up on.
Idiot.
He’s looking in all the wrong places; there’s more ammo in my dodgy papers than he’d know what to do with, and this moron can't spot the woods from the trees.
Thank Christ he’s incompetent.
He takes a look at my throwover saddlebags on the back of the bike. “These are illegal.”
*Huh?*
“What?”
“These”, he points again, “this luggage is bad, it’s illegal in Liberia”.
That's a novel approach...
“Why?”
“Where is the support underneath? They have no support. This is illegal!”
I can see what he’s driving at; the "throwovers" get chucked on the bike the same way you'd chuck a saddle on a horse. There's no need for underneath support.
I can see how he might think that they’re suspended there by some sort of witchcraft, as I've got the joining on the seat covered by a spare tyre and camping gear.
But *illegal?*
Absurd.
I explain how it works but he insists that it's illegal to have luggage with no support in Liberia.
I unpack everything.
Show him how it straddles the seat. Secure. See?
I take his silence as a crisis of confidence and pinch my papers off him while he’s thinking of what he can do next and quickly walk away.
There’s a guy selling bottles of donkey piss petrol over the other side of the road so I busy myself with buying a “gallon of gas” off him.
I’ve got no idea how many litres to a gallon, so I don’t really know where I should be haggling. I'm probably getting done in the arse...
When I get back to the bike Peanut is back in the hut and I’m away again.
---
Nature rolls by.
More forest and more young naked topless women painted white.
I take a break. Someone has nicked my roll of gaffa tape and my spare batteries from a pocket on my bags.
No prizes for guessing who "someone" is.
How petty can you get? The roll of gaffa was practically finished, and the cheap, shitty, Chinese AA’s are worth about 10 cents each.
Pathetic.
---
Eight hours and nearly three hundred clicks of riding later and I pull into a random village whose name I don’t know.
I’m cooked.
Wrecked. It’s been a massive day.
Eight hours...
It blows my mind that I used to spend this much time, five days out of seven, sitting in a chair, in front of a computer screen, in the sky prison.
It’s an *enormous* amount of time.
I find "accommodation", if you could call it that... To turn the lights off I have to unscrew the bulb... And if you want to see anything while taking a bucket shower in the communal basin then you’d better light a candle...
Suboptimal.
---
Up in the morning, and straight away I’m *desperate* to get to Harper.
It shouldn’t be far but still I want to get there as fast as possible. I don't know why, but it feels important.
On the way out of the village I buy a half gallon of gas with the last of my Liberian dollars.
The pull to get going as soon as possible - and skip breakfast - is strong. I'm almost frantic.
I set off, I'm out of the village without eating.
Then I think better of it, and turn back.
*Why am I rushing??*
I exchange ten American dollars and buy some breakfast. Questionable brown meat with palm butter and rice. Heavy going.
I don't think to chew; I'm *still* rushing.
After seagulling breakfast I hot step it back to the bike with a full gut.
As I’m putting on my helmet I freak out.
*Panic.*
Breakfast isn’t even going to touch the sides. I’m going to shit my pants. Now. Right here. Oh *god*.
*Where can I shit??*
I jump on the bike - I don't even do up my chin strap - and *fly* out of the village.
I need to find a patch of forest. *Stat!*
As I make my get away I start to level out and calm down.
I'm not going to make a mess. I never was...
I’ve lost all confidence in my gut. That's obvious. The slightest tremor and I - figuratively - shit myself.
I need to get on top of this. I can't be terrified after every meal.
---
The road has turned to shit.
The rains have fucked it.
Any sort of incline or decline has rivers of water channelling through it. These rivers run hodgepodge down the road wherever they want - like veins - carving out deep channels as wide as my tyres.
Tricky to negotiate.
The ones that run in the same direction as the road aren’t so bad. I can see them easy, but the ones that run across the road, they’re bastards.
Impossible to spot until it's too late and you're in it. And if you land in one you’re going to ditch the bike at best, and end up over the handlebars at worst.
Looking out for them has my undivided attention...
Undivided attention isn't enough; I get caught out.
I’m heading downhill at a slow speed, but the steepness means that I can’t stop as quickly as I’d like. I get hemmed in by a deep trench that cuts in front of my path. I’ve spotted it way too late.
It’s a bike breaker.
I slam on my brakes and try to steer to the side to go through a part of the channel that looks like it’s not going to kill me. But steering and braking are too much for the tyres to do at the same time on the dirt road and the back tyre locks up and slides out violently.
I’m going to crash. But just as the bike’s about to slide out completely the two wheels smash, flush, right into the side of the ditch and the whole bike and I bounce back around to upright, popping perfectly into shape, and ride away.
A *huge* save.
It leaves me fizzing.
*What happens out here if you crash and snap a leg?*
---
*Logged.*
The old forest gives way to progress; Logged, and replaced with plantations.
Palm crops.
*Devastating.*
I wonder how much longer all the beauty I've seen in the last two days will be around for...
---
Counting kilometres. Ceaselessly looping the math of distance divided by speed equals time.
Over and over and over.
Ten kilometres - or 20 minutes - to Harper, and filthy black clouds rear their dirty heads out of nowhere.
They look like they're hanging so low they could touch the tops of the trees.
The dirtiest, darkest clouds I've ever seen. Near black, despite being in the middle of the day.
Ominous as fuck.
I whip the bike like a jockey into the final furlong.
I *fly* right under the blackest band of the clouds, without catching a single drop.
I reckon I’ve got away with this...
*Nope.*
It *hoses* rain. Big ol' fat rain.
There's more water in the air than air.
*Thick.*
In literally two seconds my jeans are soaked through, and I can feel it pouring down the back of my helmet and under the neck of my leather jacket.
This is going to ruin all my papers, and *fry* all my electrics.
I round a corner and there’s a checkpoint.
It's the first time I’ve ever been happy to see one.
Thank *Christ.*
I fly under the awning at full clip, not hitting the brakes till I'm out of the deluge. I slide to a stop.
I was in the rain for a full minute, *max*, and everything's drenched.
I check everything. Papers in my pockets are dry. My luggage is soaked, but only the outer clothes.
Lucky. Again.
They don't bother me at the checkpoint. We stand under the cover and watch the storm pass as it smashes a violent din against the tin roof a few inches over our heads.

## Chapter Sixteen
Harper.
Paradise, lost.
Beautiful and tragic.
Once upon a time it must’ve been a buzzing port town, small in size, but with grand buildings and huge mansions for the wealthy, perched on a skinny, elevated peninsula - much like Robertsport - with beautiful ocean and an endless stretch of beach.
The buildings are, without a doubt, the most overt display of opulence I’ve seen on the continent.
A proper jewel of West Africa.
Then the war came.
And the world stopped. Everything was abandoned, and no one came back.
In the handful of years that have passed since then, nature has taken it all back.
Who tells a tree where it can and cannot grow? Apparently no one.
Left to its own devices, nature has filled the derelict concrete shells that were once people’s houses with something beautiful; green.
*Everywhere.*
Creeping vegetation has coated the walls - inside and out - with living wallpaper.
It’s an indoor garden of Eden.
Parked in old living rooms are huge trees that have made the space their own; punching a hole in the roof as it grows to fill the space.
House after house, mansion after mansion, exploring them all; it’s all the same bittersweet scene. It leaves me with a sad smile at the tragedy of Liberia, yet the beauty of nature; it takes everything back once we're gone.
But if that was the beauty of nature over humanity, the beach is surely humanity over the beauty of nature.
The sandy beach stretches away to a long vanishing point. Infinite stretch. A long row of palm trees separates the ocean from an inland lake.
What should have been a beautiful stretch of pristine coastline has been soiled - literally - by shit.
*Human* shit.
Grenades and landmines of turd are *everywhere*.
I can't enjoy the walk for fear of something *awful* squelching through my toes.
When I take the risk to raise my eyes off the sand for a moment I'm greeted with a view of someone laying out fresh cable.
*Delightful.*
Anyway, enough of that shit. I get out of there and make my way to the shanty town fishing village as the sun sets.
I'm walking along the coast of the peninsula and at that moment the sun cuts through the clouds, shooting beams of light like some cliché vision of heaven. I’m not normally one for photography, but with the heavenly vista above, the ocean below, the peninsula on stage left and a fishing boat on stage right, even I can't pass this up.
So I take a photo. It’s a ripper. Like a goddamn oil painting.
While I’m admiring my good work a little kid comes up to me and motions for me to take a picture of him with the camera. I’m never one to poke a camera in someone’s face, *ever* - it’s touristy and tacky and it makes me squirm when I see others do it - but I take a picture of the kid anyway, and show him his picture on the screen. Bless the little guy, he’s delighted by it.
Then there’s yelling. In my direction.
A bloke comes running over, looking *furious*.
"You can’t take photos!!"
“What? Why not?”
He pulls out his wallet and flashes a card at me, right in my face.
*Liberia Immigration*.
Looks legit. But it’s so out of place; there is no immigration in Harper...
He tells me to follow him.
What’s this guy on about?
Am I actually in trouble, or not? *Am I??*
*Ugh*.
I follow him. Better to play it safe.
We head into a tin shanty restaurant. He tells me to sit down in a dark corner. Before I know it I’m hemmed in by him and all of his buddies. They’ve been drinking. They *are* drinking...
They all crowd in.
“Where is your permit!?”
“What? My permit for what??”
“To take photos!”
“What?? You don’t need a permit to take *photos.*”
“Yes you do, where is it??”
I’m sick of this permit shit. I’ve already been buggered once for questionable permits in this country, but this is *clearly* bullshit.
“No I don’t. What will I need a permit for next?? Breathing?!”
“Give me your camera.”
“What? No. Why?”
“You have been taking illegal photos, I need to see them.”
I hate this shit. I hate this guy like poison. Fucker. Wanker. Immigration douchebag.
I hate being beholden to the whims of pieces of shit like this guy. Especially when I’ve done *nothing* wrong.
I get out my camera and he goes to grab it, I jerk it back away from him and fend him off with my free hand. “You look with your eyes, not with your hands”.
I show him the photos I’ve taken.
“These are all illegal, you can’t take photos of these buildings. You have to delete them.”
“What!? No... That’s rubbish, these are fine. Who cares about trees in buildings?”
“Show me your papers”
“What? Why??”
He gets right up in my fucking face.
“Because I am Immigration! You do what I say! Where is your passport?”
His breath fuckin *reeks* of booze.
This is so fucking unreasonable it’s making me boil. I’d be angry if I wasn’t freaking out.
"I don't carry my passport."
“Where is it?”
“It’s at my hotel. It’s safer there.”
“No passport?”
“No, I *have* a passport, it’s at my hotel, we can go there now and I’ll show you,” I’m desperate to get myself out of this corner.
“You give me money.”
“What?? No. I don’t have any money.” And I look it too; grisly and grimy in my bashed up, weathered t-shirt and my pair of shitty “hobo pants”.
He laughs right in my face. “Hey, no embarrassment. No embarrassment...” He laughs again full in my face; That breath!
And what's fucking funny?
"Ok, I'm leaving."
I push my way out of there.
"No, you stay for a drink, ok? No embarrassment."
No. Fuck that and fuck you.
I tear out of there, heading back to my grubby hotel with a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I’m eating my rice and beans for lunch, trying to practice my French with the friendly chop shop owner from Cote d’Ivoire, and I’m accosted by a young white guy.
It's a typical ‘you’re white, I’m white, we should be friends’ encounter.
Esko the Fin. He’s here working for a non-government organisation (NGO) called the Danish Refugee Council.
The poor bastard has been in Harper, and Harper only, for over a year. Blows my friggin mind. I’ve been here for a day and a half and I’m ready to kick on...
Esko the fin proceeds to ruin my lunch by scaring the shit out of me with some fun facts about Cote d’Ivoire.
Apparently it’s a fucking *mess* over on the other side of the border. He’s a little skinny on the details, but apparently there’s a big refugee camp here in Liberia, full of people fleeing rebels in western Cote d’Ivoire who are going about killing people.
*I didn’t know that...*
Anyway, this guy obviously doesn’t get much in the way of visitors, and he’s keen as mustard to get a mob together for drinks so that we can have a proper chin wag.
Sounds great.
---
Night.
Turns out there are more whiteys in this village than I thought (I expected there to be just one: me).
We’ve got four. The additions are Tara the Yank - a chirpy, can-do go-getter in the way that only Americans can manage, and Bob the Irishman - a dour old bastard, who’s intent on steering the conversation towards how much of a dickhead I am.
Dickhead's maybe a bit strong. Perhaps *naïve* and *reckless* would be better words.
According to Bob, the Cote d’Ivoire rebels have crossed the border into Liberia to hide from the Cote d'Ivoire military. They sneak cross the border back into Cote d’Ivoire to carry out attacks and then come back again to Liberia to hide.
Anywhere within a hundred clicks of the border on the Liberian side is a serious no-go zone.
*I didn’t know that...*
Bob is giving me a serious chewing out for yesterday’s ride, which went straight through the no-go zone. Apparently I'm very lucky that something awful didn’t happen.
He say's my plan to continue on to the Ivory Coast is plain dumb. Dumb and reckless. Feckless.
He’s not mincing words, telling me I "could be killed”.
He’s dead serious about it.
The fear is contagious. It's giving me the fucking willies.
This isn’t the same as my mum telling me I could be killed; this guy is already in Liberia, so it’s safe to say that his tolerance for risk is a lot higher than most, and he is *still* telling me it’s a really bad idea.
Well, now what then?
I’ve painted myself into a corner. I’m stuffed. The only ways out of Harper are risking the road north that I just came in on, or risking the even riskier road east into Cote d’Ivoire as I’d planned.
Shit in both hands and ask which one you’d like to have.
I’d rather they just told me nothing; things were better when I was oblivious.

## Chapter Seventeen
Dread.
Nerves.
What greets me in the waking moment.
Must be a border crossing day...
In the end there really was no choice; the “don’t go to Cote d’Ivoire” option would involve bypassing it via Guinea to the north. Fuck that.
So. Let’s roll the dice.
Bob be damned.
---
The border is short jaunt from Harper, and checking out of Liberia is a piece of cake. It’s a remote border and there’s no traffic; quick and easy.
The border that separates the two countries is a river. A pretty big river. With no bridge.
I can see a couple of barges over on the other riverbank. I ask the locals at the border post what the go is.
Apparently the barges are going nowhere today; I’ve missed my window, and there’s no amount of money that could make them move.
So, that leaves those little fucking boats. Again...
A bloke floating in a carved out tree is looking at me hopefully.
Not gonna happen. I don’t have the stomach for this. Not today. And that river is waaaaay too wide.
Anyone who was at the Liberian border has gathered around me and the bike to see how this is going to end up. They’ll probably get some cheap entertainment out of this, and they’re coaxing me to give it a go.
No thanks.
I can see a boat on the other shore, one big enough to at least have a tiny motor on it. *That’s what I want.* But because no one’s moving between the borders it’s not going anywhere either.
So I wait.
My mate in the hollowed out tree isn’t doing me any favours; ferrying people back and forth, meaning that my motor boat isn’t getting the chance to fill up on the other side.
Just as I’m thinking it’s time to take my medicine and get in the canoe, the boat finally makes the crossing. I think the owner smelled some fat stacks and came across to collect.
The captain's a bit of an oddball; a little guy with only half a moustache, and I don’t mean half a mo like a Hitler style either, nor a pencil thin mo or anything like that, he’s just decided to only shave one half, so that half his face has a moustache and the other half doesn’t.
It's distracting me while I’m trying to concentrate on the haggle.
We strike a deal and load up the boat.
With many hands it's surprisingly easy to lift the bike and get it over the gunnels.
We gently chug across the border.
---
Back to French...
Half-Mo ends up sharking me on the deal by using a very favourable exchange rate.
There’s less people over this side who are keen to help lift the bike out of the boat, so it’s heavy as hell, leaving me literally dripping sweat in my leathers from the back-breaking effort.
Onto the border post.
It's a handful of buildings with a village market attached to it like a parasite.
Immigration is easy. Fill out a form, get the stamp. Immigration always seems to be a breeze, never complicated, never a hassle.
Then onto Customs for an LP for the bike, which always seems to be complicated, never breezy, *always* a hassle.
Humans cross borders with ease, motorbikes do not.
The young official tells me that the registration papers that I have plus my passport are good enough for Cote d’Ivoire, no need for a Laissez-Passer, no problem.
*Not again...*
I make the same arguments that I made with Uncle Sam, and they're equally useless.
It's so frustrating. Why the fuck don't they just give me one, even if I don't need it. What's it to them??
I'm not giving up this time.
We go in circles.
He cracks first. Tells me he’ll issue an LP for 10,000CFA.
That’s 25 bucks. That’s *double* the most I've ever paid. That’s rubbish.
I produce 4,000 CFA, 210 Liberian dollars and 1 US dollar. All counted, that’s about the equivalent of 6,000 CFA. He needs to meet me halfway...
Arguing ensues. I know the price is more than enough, so I stick to my guns.
He cracks, again.
I’m pretty pleased with myself. I've become a hardnosed sonofabitch.
He’s gets about halfway through filling out the LP, and he asks me what my mothers and fathers names are...
*What?*
“What? Por-qwar? Ce pour le moto?”
He stares at me like I’m a retard. “Oh, le moto??”
“Yeah, le moto!” What the fuck have we been talking about? Of course the motorbike!
The silly dickhead was writing out a LP for a person - not a bike.
An LP for a person?? *Is that even a thing??*
Buggered if that makes any sense.
I know that he's done it intentionally too; this guy’s not thick. Sure enough, he’s blaming me like it’s somehow *my* fuckup, and the cost goes up to 15,000CFA to cover the ruined LP.
*Fuck that.*
This is bloody extortion.
We’re both too pigheaded to back down now.
I'm certain I’ll wear him down. I’ll Shawshank it. Just chip away. I’ve got nowhere better to be.
---
An hour.
I get thirsty.
Then hungry.
And I crack.
I take his initial suggestion and just leave.
Winging it again.
*Fuck it.*
---
*Checkpoints.*
*Lots* of checkpoints.
I don't have the nerves for this...
No more bunting and ropes; *spike strips* over here.
Fuckin' *mean* ones.
Oddly, it's a good thing for me; cars can't fit through the gap they leave on the sides, but bikes can.
By the time the cops or army goobers realise from their roadside huts what’s going on I’m already past the spikes and *off*.
I can hear the trilling of angry whistles fade away as I crack on. *Bye bye!*
Fourth time, and there’s a bloke actually doing his job; standing smack bang in the middle of the road.
He waves me over.
He’s a big fucker too, with a big fuckin' machine gun. No escaping this. *Please ask for the passport.*
“Moto pap-ee-er”
*Shit*. I give him my bike’s rego papers.
He looks at it, with a perplexed look on his face. *Not good...*
“Ooo eh votre Laisser-Passez?”
Shit shit *shit!*
I pull over the bike and take my time taking off my helmet before my head melts. It's so fucking *hot*.
Now. How to play this...?
Another goober, a skinny bloke, has made his way over and wants to see my passport.
*Lovely.*
I give him my passport and we flick through the pages, talking about the journey so far, and I smoothly segue into my favourite distraction ploy: asking for directions.
It works a treat.
The two of them go into great detail of how to get to the next village, which, given there’s only one road, should have been pretty straight forward.
It’s perfectly steered the conversation; all talk of LP's forgotten.
I thank them for their crucial help, grab my papers and head off to waves and smiles. Like a goddamn magician.
I'm still on edge... This is a big country, and if four checkpoints on one stretch of road is anything to go by, there's going to be a shitload more to come.
I don't know how long my luck will last.
I’m still not really sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing that there is military crawling all over the place. I’ve got to deal with them all the fucking time, but at least I'm not being shot by rebels...
Already I wish that I had of swallowed my pride and paid the outrageous fee at the border for the Laissez-Passer and had that be it; it's really not worth the stress.
I'm going to do a Ziguinchor, and get a LP from Customs in my first port of call; San Pedro.

## Chapter Eighteen
*Nope.*
After running around for half a day at the utterly incompetent Douanes in San Pedro, and being told it’s impossible, I finally talk my way up a few flights of stairs to the big boss; the man who can get stuff done.
The chief is sitting in his big office, in a big chair, in full uniform.
We chat and he says that he can indeed make a Laissez-Passer for me - no problem - and it’ll *only* cost 30,000 CFA.
I laugh openly in his face. Can’t help it.
That’s three times more than the ass at the border was bending me over for.
I meet absurdity with absurdity and pitch it back at him with a zero missing off the back - 3,000 CFA. He looks faux-offended; like I farted in his august presence.
This isn’t going anywhere.
I thank him for his time and walk out.
---
Despite the bad start I reckon I’m going to like Cote d’Ivoire. It’s a bit more modern than most places in this neck of the woods, I can see that already; the toothpaste here is *actually* toothpaste.
Things are looking up.
I want to get to Yamoussoukro, the country's capital (wrap your mouth around that one: Ya-moh-sue-crow). Yamoussoukro is the capital of CI in the same way that Canberra is the capital of Australia, or Washington the capital of the States.
It’s the capital, sure, but it’s not really.
Anyway, I’ve been told that there’s some stuff out there that’s worth a look.
It’d want to be pretty special. There’s four hundred clicks to cover, into roads I don’t know, for a destination I know nothing about.
One thing's for sure: there’s not going to be any viable places to sleep in between here and there - unless the shit *really* hits the fan...
By rights, I should be heading east as quick as the bike can take me, out of the really dodgy area of Cote d'Ivoire and into somewhere safe. Instead I’ll be going mostly north, parallel to the border, where I really shouldn't be.
Four hundred click of checkpoints...
The word is dread. Dread, and nerves.
But for some reason I'm gonna do it anyway.

## Chapter Nineteen
Yamoussoukro.
I ride into Yam' in a dripping lather of exhaustion.
Relieved.
*Eight hours* in the saddle.
*What a day.*
My headspace has been dominated by doing mental math. Predictions. Time equals distance divided by speed. Again...
Hardly a spare other thought crept into my mind.
The hamster wheel of stupid, irrelevant calculation. Maddening and exhausting.
The closer to Yam', the more time seemed to draw out.
The last hour felt like a small infinity.
Little eternity.
Didn’t help that there's nothing to see.
Cote d'Ivoire seems to be nothing but rows upon rows of palm or rubber plantations. As a side-note, who knew that rubber came from trees??
So weird.
Anyway. After the rich green forests of eastern Liberia, it's not a stretch of the imagination to think of what must have been destroyed in the name of money and progress.
Tragic.
And the checkpoints! Bloody hell. Every village had at least one. At least!
Lots and lots of shrieking whistles and pissed off cops in the mirrors today.
Fuck 'em; I ain’t stopping... If I stopped every time someone blew their whistle at me I’d be closer to San Pedro than Yam' right now.
I got stopped five times. Three of those I shook hands, introduced myself, apologised for my horrendous French, and asked for directions to Yamoussoukro before they could even get a word in.
After getting instructions I would say thank you for the help, put the bike into gear and they’d let me go. No papers shown, *nothing*.
For two I wasn’t so lucky. One bloke asked for my papers, so he got my passport, then asked for the bike papers, and was suitably confused by the bikes rego to think that it was enough.
The last bloke wasn’t so thick.
He caught me out trying to dodge a checkpoint by hiding in the gridlock of the only major village I came across.
“Ca,” he holds up the rego papers "ce *pa* bien".
I tell him of course it is, and ask him how he thinks I got this far - through the plethora of fucking checkpoints - if the papers aren’t any good?
Riddle me that.
He wasn't convinced, “No, pas bien, you give money”. I reply that I have none.
“You give me money. You give me money for water.”
Ha! Really? Money For water? You sure? A half-litre of filtered water in a sealed plastic sack costs less than 5 cents.
I empty my out my pockets and I’ve got 500CFA in coin - a touch over a dollar - which I put into his hand. He looks at me like I’ve just farted. Been getting that a lot lately...
He begrudgingly gives me back my rego.
Easy!
After six hours of riding the road turned from dirt into pretty serviceable tarmac.
Then it turns into a four lane highway that wouldn’t be out of place in Europe...
I've never seen anything like it.
Not on this continent anyway...
It's flawless; a proper highway with painted markings, streetlights, flyover bridges and big blue metal signs pointing the way to Yamoussoukro. *The works.*
Fuck, Yamoussoukro must be a *behemoth*. And that’s not good; I don’t like big cities. After a big day like this I don’t relish the idea of looking for accommodation in a crazy big, bustling city; not after what happened in Monrovia.
I’m nervy and tired enough already.
The four lanes turn into six. A lonely six; There’s no one else on the road.
*Where is everyone?*
A few empty junctions with traffic lights on them(!) and the GPS tells me that I’ve arrived in Yamoussoukro.
I look all about me. All I see is a village...
*What’s going on here?*
I keep riding on.
Then, *bang.*
My jaw goes slack, the bike coasts.
Someone’s dumped the Vatican in a paddock...
I shit you not. The fucking *Vatican*.
I’m looking at it. *Right at it.*
It’s *immense*. Colossal. The real deal.
My brain’s not doing well with this, at all.
*How?*
How is the Vatican - Saint Paul's fucking cathedral - in West Africa? In a cow paddock...
Just... *What??*
The bike is stopped, but I don't remember when I did that. 
My hanging jaw turns into a grin fit for a loon.
This is fucking *awesome!* This is going to be *fucking* awesome!
I zoom into the village, find any accommodation, throw my shit on the floor, and hot step it to the Vatican.
It just keeps getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, till finally I'm gripping the bars of the fence, trying to move my head about to get a better view.
It's *enormous*.
The heavens open, and it starts to piss rain on me.
It’ll have to wait till tomorrow...
I walk back to the village in a soaked daze.
---
Over dinner, I bend the ear of a local.
I’ll give you the clippings: Cote d'Ivoire was ruled by a democratically elected president for a bunch of years till he died. "Democratically" is, I imagine, a stretch; folks who rule for life don't tend to not be dictators... Anyway, in that time, the President and the country had become quite wealthy with all those juicy palm plantations. Cote d'Ivoire came to be known as “the jewel of West Africa”. Now our buddy the President was getting on in years, and in his old age he went a little nuts. He wanted *legacy.* So he glorified Yamoussoukro for no reason other than that it was his home village; he made it the capital of the country, and spent a fuck-tonne of money on it. *Splash*. He built all of those fancy roads, he built his presidential palace here (complete with a moat filled with crocodiles. *Believe it*), he built a massive conference centre that’s so grand looking that I mistook it for a football stadium, and he built the *biggest church in the world*. In the *whole friggin world*. Think about that for a sec. The biggest church in the world is in a cow paddock in West Africa. It’s sitting there, right now. Unbelievable, isn't it? Anyway, I wasn’t far wrong in thinking that someone had picked up the Vatican and dropped it here – the design of the dome and the "courtyard out the front" is a replica of the Vatican, which, I'm told, pissed off the Pope quite a bit...
So. There you have it.
And all that in an otherwise unremarkable little village.

## Chapter Twenty
Up close...
*Absurd* is the word...
I can't stop shaking my head, open mouthed, smiling.
It’s the most beautiful church I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen some doozies.
On arrival at the gates of yesterday I'm skimmed in along with a group, split into two precise columns. I don't have any idea what the fuck is going on - the preamble was in French - but I just go with the flow.
We make our way solemnly down the immense marble floored grounds leading up to the basilica - hundreds of meters - in silence.
I'm struck by the similarity of this gargantuan basilica with an egg in an eggcup.
I’ve got to stifle a giggle. It looks *just* like one.
Finally we get to the front doors. It’s obvious that there’s already something going on inside.
Our whole group gets hosed down with an overly generous lashing of holy water. We’re let in.
The place is packed. Everyone is already seated. There’s gotta be *thousands* in here.
I take one of the last seats available with the rest of my group.
I don't think I'm meant to be here... I think I might have just jagged a massive win; right place, right time.
I've got my own air conditioning vent in the seat in front of me...
*Opulence.*
From the outside it was imposing and impressive, from the inside it’s just plain beautiful.
*Stunning.*
The church is a grand, perfect cylinder with the altar at its centre. Around the perimeter there are no walls. It’s all columns and archways of immense stained glass windows.
The *colours*...
My god...
The morning sunlight is pouring through the windows. The depth and richness of all those colours - blues and golds and greens and reds - like thousands of shards of precious stone. Sitting in here feels like being in the middle of a many coloured, many faced jewel.
Awe inspiring.
*How the fuck can they afford this??*
I peel my eyes off the windows for a moment and get lost in the dome above; *more* stained glass; swirling rings of blue and gold, encircling to meet in the middle at a dove in white.
Magnificent.
---
The *mass* starts.
It's a wonder that anyone could pay attention to it, given the surroundings. And the fact that it's in French makes a slam dunk of my decision not to listen.
I'm more interested in the wooden adornment built into the end of each of the luxurious pews. It looks remarkably like a fist sized Easter egg in an egg cup.
For the life of me I can’t shake the notion that we’re all here to worship the mighty Lord and Savoir: *Egg.*
I gawk about for a long time, till I finally feel like I've soaked and taken a memory of every aspect of the building. When there's nothing left to do, I finally start paying attention.
This is obviously not your run-of-the-mill mass; there are more priests up on that alter than you could shake a stick at; I count twenty. There are four whities in amongst them and a bloke with a big, tall, fancy, papal looking hat.
Must be the biggen.
In the same way that McDonald's tastes the same anywhere you go, so does a mass. After getting dragged to church on Sundays for many years, I know it by heart, and I can recognise what's going on, even in French.
No one else seems to know what’s going on...
To stand, to sit, or to kneel? That is the question.
There's no consensus.
At one point in the mass there's a third of the faithful doing each.
---
Two hours in.
Even the priests don't even seem to know what to do next. There are some pregnant pauses...
*This is so awkward...* I want to run away.
There's a bloke two rows back from me who is snoring. *Loudly*.
A woman a couple of seats to my left decides that now is a great time to flop a tit out and starts breastfeeding her kid.
The choir fire up. They're superb. I close my eyes and get taken to a cathedral in Europe with their sound.
Then the keyboard gets going. Small and tinny and cheap. It can't fill the room.
It's playing cheesy pre-loaded backing tracks and melodies.
This is so *weird*.
I think of the place, and think of what this mass could have been...
---
Three hours in two other blokes are asleep. It's starting to become understandable.
I reflect on the lunatic who thought this was a good idea, the President, and come to the sad conclusion that we're actually very much alike: We both have the money and the ability to make a difference in Africa, but we’re both spending it in ways that are self-serving, selfish, frivolous, and maybe more than a little megalomaniacal.
Put more simply, we’ve both got our heads up our own arses.
The priests all leave and everyone seems to be looking about for a sign that it's ok to leave ourselves.
We're released from this stunning, gorgeous purgatory.
---
Dinner costs me 30 cents, a whole pineapple for desert costs the same, and mangoes – the biggest you’ve ever seen – cost 10 cents each. This is my kind of place...
On the walk home I come across a car outside the butchers section of the market. The boot is open, and full of chickens.
*Packed* with chickens.
*Alive* chickens.
They're just sitting there, huddled together.
No one's watching them. They aren't tethered. They could escape. *Easily*.
I stand there, eating a mango and watching.
Not one of them makes a move.
They've trapped themselves.
I think back a mere year ago, back to the skyprison... The office...
A chicken, waiting patiently in the boot of the car for the butcher...

## Chapter Twenty One
Wake up.
Sickening, dripping dread. I feel it. The *moment* that I know where I am.
My chest tightens. My heart rate revs. Kicks.
A moving day...
Every moving day has somehow become a little terror.
This place, Yamoussoukro, which just a day ago was scary and foreign and unknown, has become my safe place. My safe zone. It’s become my home. I’m settled. Now the next place becomes the scary, the foreign, the unknown.
The terrifying.
But I have to keep moving.
There's no choice.
I have to unhinge myself from the safe place, and head out into a scenario with so many variables, so many unknowns, and so many worries.
It's starting to happen every single time I shift.
I know already that when I arrive at my destination the relief will be huge. The weight will lift off my shoulders, the press will lift off my chest. My heart rate will finally drop. My frazzled, hamster-wheel mind will slow down.
It will feel like a drug.
The terror and the relief are like different sides of the same coin, with no middle ground; quantum leaps from terror to relief and back again.
*I’m sick of it.*
Every single time, I form this attachment; every single time, I’m scared to leave; every single time, the unknown road and unknown destination are scaring the shit out of me. And the whole routine keeps paying itself forward. It started when I left my home and got on a plane...
I’m doing it now on such a regular basis that it’s unsettling.
It’s starting to wear me thin.
It seems to get worse every time.
*Compounding*.
There’s *always* something to worry about, and if I let this hand wringing go unchecked I’ll drive myself mad.
I want to get back to that smiling, oblivious, carefree, happy-go-lucky idiot who was just taking it as it comes; "don’t let it be a problem till it’s a problem"; that guy who slept at night.
The attitude has gotta change.
No one made me do this. It was me.
It was adventure I wanted. Wasn’t it?

## Chapter Twenty Two
Well. It worked.
I changed my attitude, and riding went from being a purgatory to a pleasure.
Over the last few days I’ve ridden through - and out of - Cote d'Ivoire, with barely a hitch; no issues with the cops, military, anyone.
I’ve got a new visa in my passport for Togo. 
The only flaky moment was when my clutch cable snapped in a place called Abidjan; the skyscrapered "true capital" of Ivory Coast.
I’d never really paid that much attention to the clutch cable, but it essentially connects the hand lever on the handle bars to the engine in much the same way that a those steel wires on a bicycle connect your handles to the brakes.
I’m lucky enough to have a spare. *Two spares,* even. Easy enough then...
*Nope.*
For the life of me I couldn't figure the bloody thing out. After hours of sitting on the floor, hours of looking at the spare and the existing cable, hours of scratching my head, hours in the blazing, maddening heat, I was no closer to fixing the thing.
It just didn't make sense.
The spare and the original just don't *look* the same...
A “mechanic” came to help me out. As soon as he sat down he starts bending the cable when it clearly wasn't supposed to be bent. That’s how it is with African mechanics – the quickest and easiest solution to a problem is the right one - never mind how it’s *supposed* to work, how it’s *designed* to work; if it works, it works.
That’s their mindset, but it’s not mine. I cracked it at him for putting a kink in the cable and buggering it. He put down that freshly ruined cable and then, inexplicably, picked up my second spare and starts twisting that like a clown making balloon animals for children. I flew right off the handle.
Silly dickhead.
He left.
After another hour or so staring at it I gave in. I bodged it - a rough one - just tying the loose end of the cable on with a granny knot. A very agricultural bodge indeed.
Doing some checking afterwards I discovered that the mugs back in England had given me the completely wrong set of spares.
Useless fucks.
After that debacle I checked in at a shitty hotel and found some internets, to which I was greeted with this message from my Mum, which I'll repeat here verbatim:
"Ok I was just driving home and they were talking on the Abc about an epidemic in Africa of a disease called abola ( I just googled it but I obviously have the wrong spelling) and people are dying. They are going to restrict enter and it's the place you are at now..FUCK!! And a place called Ginny ( not sure of spelling but that is how it sounds!) you get diarrhoea and then you bleed and die. Apparently over 70 people have died including westerns who were there helping. I am not been alarmist I am just telling you what I heard on the radio.
Please please get out of there!!!
Love you xx"
*Abola?*
My mum can spell... Grammar maybe not so much, but she can spell. It was obviously written pretty frantically. The "FUCK!!" also gives it away. I reckon she means *Ebola.*
All I know about Ebola comes from a Weird Al Yankovic song called Horrorscope, which - for reasons I can't explain - I committed to memory when I was 15 years old. Here's the lyric:
"Pisces!
Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos
With the Ebola virus
You are the true Lord of the Dance
No matter what those idiots at work say"
So that's not overly descriptive. Nor particularly serious...
I look it up. Ebola virus.
It *is* serious.
It's already spread to Liberia. Two confirmed cases there...
It's infectious.
*Really* infectious; you can catch it as easily as contacting someone's *sweat*.
Symptoms are fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, unexplained haemorrhage from nose and mouth. Then fucking *death*.
Back in that shithole brothel in Monrovia I could have ticked all of those boxes except two...
I think about that Monrovian marketplace, dripping wet with everyone else's sweat... 
Nine in ten who catch it, die.
I feel ok now...
Plus, it's not in Cote d'Ivoire.
It'll be contained; they’ll close borders. I'm safe.
I reply to mum with that.
JB's deeper in the rack than I am. I tell him he might want to put some geographical distance between himself and all of that. And if he starts to haemorrhage he might want to get it checked out...
Time to *move*.
---
The border’s *wild*.
Busy enough that whole villages have popped up to service them.
People everywhere.
Getting the bike to the front is like riding through a mosh pit of a thousand people who are all head and shoulders taller than you.
I crush some toes and park up.
I hustle and muscle *hard* to get to the poor swamped bastard sitting behind the desk at Immigration.
It's like a scene from Wall Street during the Great Depression; people frantically throwing paper everywhere.
Once through the melee I’m stamped out of Cote d'Ivoire. It's too busy here for anyone to give a fuck about my bike or the fact I've ridden though all of the country without the correct papers...
Stoked with that.
I cross a river (with a bridge, for a change) and I'm on to the Ghana post.
The Queens English. Again.
I smash my way through another mob of sweaty people to get the passport stamped by Immigration. Piece of cake.
I’m in. No worries.
I head to Customs, which is less packed, and get flatly rejected.
The woman behind the glass window will do nothing other than stamp a *Carnet de Passage*; that yellow pad of papers that JB carries around.
No Laissez-Passers.
No Temporary Import Permits.
It's Carnet de Passage or bust.
I’m fucked. Stranded.
I panic.
While pacing around the post in a fizz of panic, I waylay a bloke who looks like a boss as he’s walking past. He’s a big fucker, and dressed in full uniform with a military looking hat and everything. I shake his hand, introduce myself, and I ask him if I can get a Laissez-Passer. He tells me, sternly “Impossible. We don’t do Laissez-Passers” he keeps on walking.
I jump in front of him, cutting him off "Well, a TIP then?”
He softens. I don't know why. “Why do you want a TIP? Why don’t you have your Carnet?”
“Because it’s cheaper...”
He laughs his head off.
I didn’t think it was that funny...
He good-naturedly waggles his finger at me, smiling “You travellers, eh!? Where have you come from?”
I sound off the roll call of countries travelled and show him my passport - which is starting to become quite the document - and point out the bike I've done it on.
He fuckin' *loves* it.
“Haha, ok, ok. The TIP’s are for ECOWAS citizens only, but for you we will have an exception.”
You fuckin *beauty.*
---
It takes us about half an hour to do the paperwork – this obviously isn’t standard, I’ve obviously gotten very, very lucky here. He asks me about my insurance and I get away with using my irrelevant UK insurance.
I get an enormous document of an LP in my hot hands for thirty six of the local clams, called *Cedis*.
Roughly 15 dollars.
We shake hands and I thank him profusely.
He calls me “a wonderful man”, and I’m touched. It’s the nicest thing anyone’s said to me in a long time.
Ghana.
A peaceful country. I have full papers. Life is good.

## Chapter Twenty Three
Standing on the shore at the end of a long, hot, sweaty day’s ride in the leathers, and I’m wondering if it’s really worth risking it.
Over the last few day’s I’ve travelled along the Ghanaian coastline, dying for a swim but not daring.
The sea has been *furious*.
A thunderstorm - and a tropical one at that - on the day I crossed the border has whipped the Gulf of Guinea into a frenzy.
The carnage of the mashed up seas and the howling of the breeze would make my glasses mist with salt water even hundreds of meters back from the shoreline.
*Violent.*
But today, here in *Cape Coast*, the wild weather has departed, leaving raging sunshine.
The stillness of air and sea leave no signs of the storm that’s been.
*Except one.*
The swell; It’s *massive.*
Deadset fucking huge.
I’m squinting out at it without my glasses on. Nothing’s sharp, but I can still see vague shapes.
A big lump of clean water, moving fast, forming up into a towering, clean wall, and dumping down in a straight line along the whole length of the beach.
I might not be seeing it so well, but I can sure as shit *hear* it; that *roar...*
I've spent the day melting in my leathers. Even this late in the afternoon the sun is still belting down. Unrelenting.
I'm stuck in two minds. Even from here the waves are intimidating. Out there - and up to my neck in it - it’s going to be sketchy at best, *really* sketchy at worst... And what about currents? Rips? I know nothing about the local conditions...
It’s a Saturday and the beach is *packed* with Ghanaians, all enjoying the beach. The “beach resort” that I’m staying at - which is full of whities (a fun novelty) - is brimming with tourists having drinks at the bar that backs right onto the beach sand.
Everyone’s enjoying the view.
Yet not a single person - *not one* - is in the water. Not one Ghanaian, not one tourist.
Join those dots...
Well... *Fuck it.*
I’m a strong swimmer...
I run at it and jump in.
It's good. *Really* good... There’s something so refreshing about being back in the ocean again. I realise how much I’ve missed it over the last few weeks.
The upside is that I’ve got it all to myself.
---
I nearly get fucking murdered on the swim out - had to swim like stink - but I've managed to negotiate my way past the breakers to the other side; gently treading water.
On one side is a perfect flat stillness, on the other, *carnage*. As the swell comes on it sucks at the water in front of it, pulling me into it, the face rears up and I'm pulled up and over the huge crest as it passes through.
At the last moment of each wave I turn my head back to the beach, to glimpse down from the top of the breaking wave, back down at where the wave is going to smash. I’m so high up that it brings on a queasy vertigo. It's a long, *long* way down. A moment later and the wave curls on itself. The thunder rolls, water erupts, spraying everywhere like a bomb. An awesome display of power.
I don't feel safe.
The big forces are making me feel very small.
All I’d been thinking about on the swim out was getting past the waves and into this safety of the flat water beyond. But - now that I’m here - the equal and opposite question presents itself; how the fuck do I get back in??
I feel an undercurrent pulling me further out. Away from the beach. I can't see well, but it feels like the beach is getting further away.
*Panic.*
In a snap, I decide I want out. *Now.*
The “smallest” wave of the set is coming. I swim like hell to try to catch it. I’ve only got a few seconds to get to the break, so it’s head down, full stroke and a six-kick.
With my eyes shut, I feel it starting to pick me up and I go for it; *thrash, thrash, thrash.*
The wave takes over. I pop my head out and take as big a breath as I can, skimming like a rock down the face of the wave. The big bastard breaks right on me.
The *roar...*
Washing machine.
I feel my forward momentum stop, change direction. I'm going backwards, up. Feet first, it bends me over backwards, and throws me over the falls again.
I'm forced into a horrible back bend.
Vulnerable. It'd take nothing to break my back...
It slams me back down like a plaything.
I rag doll over and over in the wash till I can figure out which way is up again.
I break the surface and suck air.
*I'm ok...*
The luck of not breaking by back on a sandbar has quickly turned into unluck of having nothing to stand on to get my breath back.
I need to breathe, but I also need to swim. *Now.*
I'm in the worst place I could be...
*I get to it.*
I swim for a few seconds and then turn around to time my breath and duck dive under the next wave; I don't want it catching me without a lungful of air.
Looking out to sea I spot a hazey blob in the corner of my vision. No more than a hop, skip and a jump away, just a bit deeper out than me. A black blob.
Thank Christ there’s at least *one* other person out here...
The blob’s hamming it up. He's waving to his mates on the shore, carrying on like a pork chop.
Yeah, well done mate. I'm sure everyone’s very impressed...
I turn to look to the shore to see what they’re doing; I get a quick glimpse of lots of black blobs, not moving much. Odd... It's like life on the beach has come to a stand-still.
I’m smacked in the back of the head by the next avalanche of white wash. Off guard. I’ve got no wind in the lungs. I’m empty.
My lungs wrench at me. I keep somersaulting...
Finally, I can tell up from down. I pop out of the wash, and *breathe*.
That was a *long* hold under. Yuck.
I check out the blob. I freestyle over to him, right up to the point where the blob's face becomes clear, and I know that I’m wrong; I’ve never seen a face like it. He’s terrified. *Beyond* terrified. *Way* beyond it...
I flick my head back to the shore. Lots of blobs, none moving.
Where the *fuck* are the surf lifesavers in their rubber ducky?
It takes a moment to settle into my spinning head. This is Ghana, *no one's coming...*
I turn back to the face.
He’s my age.
He’s half trying to swim, half trying to wave for help. He can't swim; even in the calm between waves he can't keep his head out of water enough. His neck is tilted back to try to keep his gaping mouth from going under.
His eyes are *wild*, looking down his nose in my direction. Face shaking.
Faarrrrrk...
I swim over to him. I still can’t stand, and I still can’t believe that he’s actually drowning. “Are you ok mate??”
What a dumb fucking question...
He grabs onto my right wrist with both of his hands - latches on. As his head goes under again we cop the next set of white wash.
*Fuck*.
Neither of us lets go as we take a roll together in the wash.
I find the surface first. I’ve got to kick like fuck to keep my head above the water while I try to pull him up. He’s not doing either of us any favours; I can still feel both of his hands clamped tightly onto my wrist, and without him swimming for himself it's like trying to drag up a sack of spuds.
In between every frog kick my head keeps going underwater, just enough to cover my mouth, I’m not really getting a chance to breathe.
He's not letting go...
*Panic.* A *monster* dump of adrenaline. *Fizz!*
I drag him to the surface and try to put some of my effort into going forward, to be beach, but we’re not going anywhere fast. There’s *such* a long way to the shore.
The shore... I turn my head to have a quick look. No one’s in the water.
I turn back to see the top half of a terrified face, and the rush of white water, coming on fast behind him. I stop pulling him, and with the extra slack I put my head well above water and take the biggest breath that I can before the white wall hits.
In the wash there’s one thought that’s overwhelming me, the only thing that matters: *Don’t let him drown you.*
Totally self-centred.
It’s weird; my mind is clear enough to reflect on how cowardly it is. It’s also thinking of the glory I can pull if I get him back to the shore... Cowardice and vanity. And not a whole lot else. Never mind what happens to this guy. I don’t care.
*Coward.*
My lungs and legs are on fire. I get to the surface, kicking like an epileptic frog and try to breathe, but it’s not enough. I slowly dredge him up. He’s been a long time under, and I don't reckon he got a breath in before he went under. The look on his face tells me that he’s figured the same thing out as I have: *This isn’t working.*
It’s not going to work.
He’s drowning now.
*Right now.*
He freaks out. *Completely.* His hands scramble up my arm like he’s climbing a rope, *fast*, and he gets to my shoulders and hauls himself on top of me, pushing me down and under.
*Bastard!* Arrgh *fuck!!!*
I try to swim up with both of my arms now. Frantic. But I can’t. My whole body is on fire, there's acid in my veins, with a special kind of burning reserved for my lungs.
I’m trying to swim and fight him at the same time.
I give that up and shove him off then pull him down, and not a second too soon because I’m panicking, out of oxygen, drowning, but I'm still well under.
My hands are at the surface but my head's not as the next layer of wash comes piling over the top and knocks me around.
*Oh no...*
This is it...
I’ve been under for too long.
*Gonna die gonna die gonna die.*
Without the young bloke as dead weight I make the surface far quicker. And *breathe*. I'm choking and coughing on water; half of it's been swallowed, the other half went down the wrong pipe. It's grating and burning the back of my throat as I burk it up.
I’m shit scared. Wide-eyed fucking *terrified*.
Fuck this. Fuck him. *I’m out*.
I don’t even think of staying out there; not for a moment, even though I've got my breath back and I'm swimming fine.
I want out of this water, right fucking *now*.
I freestyle slowly for the shore, leaving the young bloke out there to drown.
As I throw in the towel, a few Ghanaians - young blokes themselves - come swimming out the other way; if you can call *that* swimming...
*I don't care.*
They can manage it. I want nothing to do with it.
I get to the shore. *Safe.* Slumped with hands on knees.
My head is clear, and cold.
I'm fine; so I have to act it up that I'm in worse shape than I really am, lest people think I gave it up too early; I don't want to be judged.
And then it sinks in: the kid's dead. And I’m alive. And I threw it in early. *Way* too early. I could have stayed out there, tried again after getting my breath back. I hardly fucking had a crack at it. I must look like I’ve had a crack, sure, but I know the score... And now someone's dead.
*Coward.*
I’m so disappointed with myself; at the pointy end, when *truly* tested - a *true* test of character, a *true* test of the man - and I copped right out.
Fucking *dead*.
That look on his face...
Standing on the beach, I know all of this. Yet, even now, *this very moment*, I won't go back out there. I’ve got my breath back, I’m still alive, I’m actually fine. I *could* go back out and try again. I *could* go out there and fix this, undo this cowardly shit. But I don’t dare to.
Instead, I keep up the act; coughing and spluttering; looking like I’m suffering a lot harder than I have a right to, so that no one that was watching - and there are hundreds now - will know how gutless I am.
It's disgusting.
---
A local bloke comes dodging through the crowd with a surfboard.
A longboard.
*Good.* That’ll help.
He comes down to where I am - at the point where the wet sand meets the dry - and holds the board out to me.
*What?*
Nah. *Nope*. I can’t... *No.*
He insists.
I take the board. What else can I do?
I haven’t turned to look at what’s going on out in the wash since I left it. And I’ve got no idea what’s going on. He could be still alive, he might be dead. I don’t know.
*Time is of the essence.*
Without really caring - and I can hardly believe this myself as I watch myself do it - I put the surfboard on the ground and start untying the velcro on the leg rope that tethers to the board.
*I’m a piece of shit.*
The first strip of velcro comes off, then the next, and the loop is open. Now I’ve got to get it around my wrist. It’s like putting on a giant wrist watch – that awkward action when you only have one hand free. I’m fiddling with the velcro and I can’t get it right.
It's taking *ages...* The clock is ticking. Fast. And I’m in slow motion.
Some poor fucker is dead or dying, and I’m tying a leg rope to my wrist.
Covering my own arse.
Selfish bastard. *Self self self.*
I fail at it once. Then twice. I realise too late that it probably would have been quicker to use both my hands and tie the fucking thing around my ankle where it's supposed to fucking be; it's called a leg rope for a reason... But I’m too far along now, and I keep at it.
I wonder what the people watching are thinking of me.
*Pragmatic?*
*Scumbag?*
Dunno.
Third time’s a charm.
*Finally* I jog into the water, awkwardly get on the board, and start paddling.
The first wave of wash knocks me off the board.
I can’t stand, even this close to the shore, and I labour to get back on. My arms don’t feel like working anymore.
The second wave knocks me off, again. I can't get back on the board till another lot of whitewash has come through.
Finally, I manage to negotiate a few waves of wash without falling off, and make progress.
I make it out to the three guys who had gone out when I came in. They've been out here, treading water - and struggling at that. These blokes don’t look like they could swim in a bathtub, let alone out here in this heavy wash.
They’re yelling their heads off, hovering in a triangle around the fourth. The fourth is the young bloke.
All I can see of him is the slump of his back, and the back of his head - face down. That’s it, not moving.
Jesus effing *Christ*...
All the blokes treading water leave the body and come swimming over to the board, frantic, thrashing, and awkward - they each look like a dog that's been thrown into deep water for the first time.
They latch onto the surfboard like it’s just saved them.
Another wave of wash comes through and scatters us like ten pins, and I'm flung off the board.
Water’s all white foam and froth. I'm glad for the leg rope...
The four of us get back to the board and grab hold. We swivel our heads around. But the body has gone missing. Can’t see it anywhere.
*Vanished.*
All four of us are yelling now, panicking.
One of the guys spots something bobbing, sickeningly, in the water a few strides away.
*That’s it.*
No one’s actually on the board anymore; all four of us are in the water with one arm across it to stay afloat. We have to do an awkward one armed scramble with the free hands to get to the body.
The poor bastard's gone. Time’s up...
We’re all struggling and straining to pull him up onto the board, but there’s no way to get any purchase, no way to get any leverage to lift him onto the surfboard with. Not from down here in the water with him. He’s slippery, and he’s so goddamn *heavy.*
Incredibly, impossibly heavy.
All dead weight.
Another fucking wave of wash comes through but it's a small one, and we manage to keep hold of him and the board this time.
I don't know how, but we haul him onto the board and arrange him so he's lying straight. We point the longboard at the shore, and paddle.
The next whitewash through is big and powerful enough to drag the board, the body, and us four hangers-on all the way back to the shore.
The three swimmers - and one other bloke from the gathered crowd - grab the limp body, arms and legs - a man to a limb - and unceremoniously haul him, face down, up the beach.
*It’s done.*
I take my time to slowly carry the surfboard up to the dry sand before I put it down and tear the leg rope off my wrist. It’s bizarre - and even while I’m doing it I’m reflecting on how weird an act it is - but we wouldn’t want a wave to come and wash the board away now, would we?
*Am I out of my mind??*
The guys have been smart enough to think the same way about the body, and they’ve run it all the way up the beach and dumped it face first into the dry sand. They roll it over onto its back as I come over.
There's a massive mob gathered. Everyone is losing their shit. Women are wailing, men are yelling, everyone’s making a huge racket.
I push my way to the front row.
The eyes are half open, half closed, and all whites. A bit foamy around the mouth too.
No one’s doing anything. There are a few people kneeling about him, giving him a bit of a shake. *That's it...*
There’s gotta be a doctor in amongst all those tourists at the bar, *surely*, or at least someone in medicine, or *something*. Some sort of professional. Someone *qualified...*
And there’s no way that they could have missed this hoopla...
I get on my knees.
Righto... Fuck. I know first aid - I’ve been trained, *sort of*... That was a while ago. *Years* ago, even.
Better than nothing... It’s not like I can make it any worse than it is, can I?
Ok. Ok, ok, ok. Here we go. "DR ABC". Those are the letters to follow...
Ok.
"D"...
*What the fuck does "D" stand for??*
*Fuck!!*
Dee... Dee dee dee dee...
Danger! *Yes!!*
No. No Danger. *Good.* Move on.
"R", is... *Resuscitation...?*
What the *fuck* does that mean?? Resuscitation??
What am I supposed to do for that??
"*Response!!*"
"R" is Response!
Shake him, *right?* Get a Response. Yes. No - they’ve been shaking him already... So...
I wind up a trembling hand and give him a massive, adrenaline-fuelled bitch slap right across the face. Damn near rip his head off; my fingers fucking hurt.
The gathered mob has been looking at me for cues on how to assist. Without my say-so they start laying into the guy, belting the shit out him. *Fists* come in from everywhere. Everyone’s taking their chance to do their bit and sock him one. I'm *shrieking.* Some silly dickhead down the end starts punching him in the thigh over and over, giving him a dead leg. Dumb fuck. While some other bloke’s sunk the boot in a couple of times before they finally hear me over the din, and give it a rest.
*Fuck’s sake.* It’s gone from resuscitation to mugging...
The pummelling’s had no effect. I was hoping - *really* hoping - he'd just wake up.
"A". Airways.
Yes. Right...
*Ummm...*
Airways. That means making sure he hasn’t chundered. Right? Or swallowed his tongue?
I grab his face with my hand and squeeze, like I'm trying to get a stick off a dog. I’m trying to pull his jaw down with my other hand at the same time, but it’s not loose. It won’t come apart. His skin just moves, the teeth wont. The bastard is locked up *tight*.
I try to put my fingers in between his teeth to pull it apart.
Clamped shut.
I wiggle a little bit of my fingers in the gap of his overbite - just enough to get a purchase - and pull like hell. It gives. *Just* enough room to fit my other fingers in. I’ve gotta strain to pull his teeth apart; I’m using so much force I’m waiting for his bottom jaw to just snap right off.
First a beating, then a broken jaw. Fucking *brutal*.
I take a close look around inside his mouth.
*Foamy.*
No vom. And the tongue is where it ought to be.
*Good.*
D.R. A. "B"...
*Breathing!* How do I check that??
His chest. If it’s moving up and down, that’d be it. *Right?*
Everyone else is still shaking him. I don't think I'd be able to tell one way or the other. It's too subtle...
I stick my ear down to his mouth and nose - and listen.
That’s *retarded.*
I can’t hear myself *think* over this fucking din - let alone listen out for something as light as the breath of a body...
Fog a spoon?
*Fuck off.*
*Panic.* More adrenaline.
*I don't know how to do B*.
Can I skip it?
Wait... Is the “mouth to mouth” bit supposed to be part of “B” or “C”?
What does it matter?? Gotta do it.
C. Circulation. Last thing.
It’d be fucking *ideal* if someone wanted to part the crowd right about now and say “Stand back! I’m a *doctor!* I'll take it from here!”
Fuck. I’m kneeling over him and just shaking out my fingers by my sides like a fucking dandy.
*Did it have to be a bloke?*
Any fucking time now...!
*OK! Here we go!!*
I grab his jaw, I put my mouth wide over his open mouth, make the seal, and blow.
*Fooomp!*
A big glob of snot comes flying out of his nose and sprays all over my cheek.
Fuck! *Fuck fuck fuck!*
*Godfuckingdamnthisshit.*
I can’t *think*!
Right. *Fuck!* Try again.
This time block that *goddamn* nose.
Someone next to me is very close and is yelling something in my ear. I’ve got my fingers pinching his nose and my other hand holding his jaw open as I turn my head to look.
It’s a white girl, about my age.
She says something in English. Even though I’m looking right at her I can’t register it. It’s too loud. And I’m not *really* listening. I’m not even really *here*... It’s all too much.
“What?!”
“You need to check the pulse!”
“*What???*”
“Have you checked the pulse?!” 
“The pulse?!” I look back at the body.
Fuck. *Have I missed a step?*
Does it even matter right now?
Fuck the pulse. I turn back to her, “Who the fuck are you?! Are you a fucking doctor??”
“Yes!!”
Wait...
“*WHAT?!*” I stare at her and she just stares right back at me.
*“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??”*
I look back at the body, then back to her. She doesn’t make a move to take over, she just kneels there in the sand, jibbering about the pulse...
Bugger it. Where was I? *Right.*
I blow, again. No snot. He makes a sound like an air mattress being blown up. I can see from the corner my eye his chest inflate and rise up a surprisingly high amount. *It's working.*
Good! Excellent! Progress!
I remember this now: two of those breaths, then thirty pushes on the chest - two every second - count to fifteen as you go. Try to crack ribs, that means you're doing it right. I *remember* this...
Ok!
Two pumps to each count...
*One.. Two.. Three.. Four..*
*Everyone* tries to help. *Again.* Everyone within reach is mimicking me. The trouble is that they’re doing it everywhere. *All over*. Someone’s shoving him in the guts, someone’s shoving him in the side, someone’s doing it on the other side of his chest, out of sync with me. That dumb fuck down the end starts doing compressions on his leg.
*This isn’t real.*
I scream at them to stop it. I shriek it at the top of my lungs. *They're fucking it up.*
But the mob has reached fever pitch. Either they can’t hear me or everyone’s as desperate and freaked out as I am. They’ve all stopped listening to me. I shove one guy off, then another. In the time that I’ve shoved the second bloke off the first one’s gone back to mashing his guts again.
Nothing for it. *Hopeless.*
I sit back.
The body is jiggling and wobbling around like jelly with everyone’s pushing. It all looks a little crook.
*What to do now?*
Fuck it; might as well keep going till the ambulance gets here.
Wait. Is an ambulance even coming?? Surely someone's made a call... Do they even *have* ambulances here??
In any case, there's no point in stopping what I'm doing...
Another two breaths in, and I start the compressions again.
I’m looking from his face to his chest, from his chest to his face as I go, and his half open mouth suddenly wells up with water and starts spilling over his cheeks like a blocked up laundry sink.
*"Whoa!!"*
I flip him onto his side like I’m flipping a table.
Water comes *pouring* out of his mouth. *A lot of it*. There are chunks of pink stuff in it. What the fuck is the pink stuff?? Chunks of *lung??*
I roll him onto his back when it’s stopped flowing out.
Is he breathing? I put my ear to his mouth again. I can't tell shit... I think we've just plunger'd him.
*Dunno.*
The crowd is going mental. Everyone’s screaming.
I give him two more breaths. I go to work on his chest again.
He starts doing little convulsions in his guts - I can *see* it flex - even with everyone shoving him all over.
This is *definitely* him...
I flip him onto his side again and he convulses, a big one, and noiselessly brings up a heap of water. He pipes a half bucket of seawater out onto the sand, relaxes, then convulses again and brings up the other half.
More water than you’d think possible.
More chunky pink bits.
He starts making noises like he’s got machine gun hiccups.
*Everyone* loses their shit. It’s panda-fucking-monium.
I leave him on his side. The "recovery position".
I lean over him and look at his face.
His eyes are open. Bulging *way* out of his head and bloodshot to hell. Like a fish brought up from deep water; his eyes look like they’re about to pop right out of his head.
They’re not blinking, they’re not moving, just staring, fixedly, at nothing.
Jeeeeeesus. H. *Christ.*
*Is he alive??*
I can’t tell... I can’t tell if the hiccuping is really, *really* shallow breathing, or just convulsions that are getting no air in.
I stick my ear next to his face again but the crowd has gone totally deafening, It’s impossible to know whether he's breathing for himself or not.
People are trying to push him out of the "recovery positions" and onto his back. This time I’m having none of it. I'm ready to punch someone in the face. They stop pushing.
I bend over him again, real close, and he’s breathing. *Tiny* little gasping breaths, but it’s definitely getting into him.
I’m looking right at his eyes, I try to talk to him and get a reaction. He’s not looking back. He’s still got that far-off, wide-eyed stare.
His eyes are so far out of his skull that it looks cartoonish; it looks broken.
Too late?
Braindead?
Alive, at least. On a knife's edge... but alive.
*Ambulance time.*
I scream up at the mob to "call a fucking ambulance" but no one’s listening to me; they're too busy losing their minds.
No one’s giving me the green light that an ambo is on the way, or exactly what the fuck the plan is now...
It’s making me furious.
I pick out a tourist in the crowd, lock eyes with the guy, point at him and scream at him to get an ambulance.
Off he runs.
*Good.*
Back to the dead guy. He's still hiccuping away. He doesn’t look conscious, but I tell him that he’s ok and that help is coming anyway, and tell him to try to breathe a little deeper.
*No response.*
The chief muggers have decided that now is the time to get him off the beach.
They start to grab limbs and pick him up.
I'm having none of it; This bloke looks right on the edge of the living and the dead, I reckon if they shift him he could easily stop breathing again and die anyway. He shouldn't move an inch till he’s at least blinking again, or breathing something close to normal, or till an ambo comes...
I yell at them to leave him where he is.
They yell back.
It's a shouting contest, they're giving me full beans.
I’m upto my gills in adrenaline. I shriek right back at them.
*I'm going to punch someone...*
Then it all snaps.
All the adrenaline blows up and I'm suddenly knackered.
I melt into a pile and sit back on my haunches.
*Fine.* It's someone else’s problem now...
They drag him off; a man to a limb again; face down, again; running, ungraceful and uncaring. *He looks dead.*
Poor bastard's gonna die twice in a day.
*I feel sick.*
---
His name is Richard.
He's alive.
Not brain dead or anything.
He's KO’d in a hospital bed; a pretty shitty hospital bed.
His only complaints - back when he was briefly conscious - were that his stomach and legs were really, *really* sore. Of course he couldn't join the dots as to why drowning would make his legs hurt so much. Clearly no one's filled him in yet on the mugging...
I'm getting this intel from his mates; the gutsy three who came in the other way when I was heading back to shore. 
*He can’t swim.*
Not even a little bit.
His mates can’t swim either; despite them being fucking *fishermen* for a living.
Seems crazy to me.
Apparently; people drown here on the coast all the time.
And despite their predisposition to sinking like rocks, they all hang out down at the beach, and just fuck about in the shallows.
Which is just plain thick, I reckon.
A big wave comes in - takes everyone by surprise - and whips someone out of the shallows, off their feet and into the waves. Their mates - who also can’t swim - can only watch as their mate drowns. Powerless to help.
Fucking *awful*.
And that's just what happened to Richard.
---
I head back to the "beach resort", and I'm treated like a hero by anyone who saw the thing.
Being hugged by people I don’t know and getting quite a few free drinks. *A lot* of free drinks, in fact.
It’s all bullshit; I know the score. Piss weak cowardice followed by the worst, most botched successful resuscitation in the history of resuscitations.
Richard wasn't the only bloke who was very lucky today. In the same grain of pure selfishness I’d exercised at the time, I shock myself again by feeling happier that he’d lived for the sake of my own conscience rather than rejoicing that he survived for his own sake.
*Luck* is the only reason that I get to be ok with this.
It seems a hollow victory; a different roll of the dice and this could have been a fucking *wake*. Should have been, in fact... All things considered...
All that I thought I was by doing this trip - brave, courageous, tough - has been revealed, at it's very depths, to be selfishness and vanity.
It's redefined me.
It feels ugly.
It’s grating on me a bit that everyone’s making out like I’m the white knight of the story.
But if they want to buy me a drink, hey, I’m not about to refuse...
---
I end the night just like Richard; bringing up a big bucket load of fluid with my eyes popping out of my head whilst lying on the sandy floor of the beach.
History, delightfully, repeating.

## Chapter Twenty Four
Cape Coast is fucking awesome.
The only touristy place I’ve seen since crossing the Sahara.
Since the carnage of day one I've been content in living the beach life.
The “resort” itself is the jewel in the crown. A sprawling hotel built from thatched huts, run by a young, humourless German.
It's filthy cheap, with decent dorms costing 7 bucks a night and good hammocks strung up between every palm tree.
There's a great bar, a free surfboard, and the heaviest showers I’ve ever stood under.
To top it all off there's nowhere in the place that you can't see the beach, or hear it; when you wake up, when you fall asleep, and all the time in between, you hear the ocean.
The joint is packed full of European backpackers, twenty-something's, all here to "rough it" in Ghana, and to do their bit of good. The so-called "voluntourists".
And after the last few months of seeing very little other than black everything - with the occasional rough looking white bloke - a blonde woman becomes quite the striking novelty.
The place is crawling with them. Most of them are either German or Danish.
Ghana seems to be a bit of a soft landing for them, as far as West Africa locations go: English as the spoken language, relative stability, security, and what you might call prosperity. That combination, it would seem, is enough to make it the go-to place for these Europeans.
The "least worst" option, if you like...
An oasis in the middle of West Africa.
By streets it’s my favourite place I’ve stayed in so far on the continent. The small luxuries here stand out like diamonds in the rough.
---
I spend two weeks. And reflect.
Here's a taste:
"I wonder why it is that I’m afraid of doing all of the things that I love doing most?
Running, surfing, diving, riding, basketball, even learning French...
They all hold a fear and anxiety before I begin them. But once I get going, I love them.
Why is that?
Is the fear the cause and pleasure the effect? What’s the relationship? Something to do with being outside of your comfort zone?
I need to push myself harder. I’m at risk of becoming soft - if I haven’t already. I'm at risk of letting fear dictate what I do and do not do.
I need to push myself. I need to be my own hero."
That, it turns out, is the exact problem with Cape Coast. Its comfortable softness is starting to make me soft. The lack of motivation is making me super lazy, and the laziness is paving the way towards depression: Waking up sometime in the afternoon, because you don’t have a watch, and then having nothing to do for the rest of the afternoon might *sound* like luxury - and sure, it is... - but you can have too much of a good thing, and it's not good for me.
Show me infinite time and I’ll show you zero motivation.
This was supposed to be an adventure; a challenge. I was supposed to be learning things - deep and profound and personal.
The most adventurous thing I’ve done in weeks is learn that fresh pineapple is amazing in muesli...
When I haven't been gorging on pineapples, I’ve been shitting my pants over Nigeria. In fact, I’ve been shitting my pants about Nigeria the entire journey; but now, shit’s getting real.
What was once something I could deal with in the future is now very much sitting just over the horizon; two tiny little countries away to the east; a clusterfuck waiting to happen.
Nigeria’s not the only thing sitting on the horizon that’s giving me the willies. Winter is coming. Well, maybe not winter, but the wet season undoubtedly is.
No question.
When it’s not bright and sunny and hot as fuck here it’s bucketing down lukewarm, torrential, tropical rain. Pissing it. Rain so thick you can’t see through it, turning the streets and gutters into rivers in mere minutes.
Both Nigeria and The Wet are ominous as fuck.
I don't want my bike dying in either...
I’m not sure which one I’d prefer least. The idea of a simple mechanical failure somewhere in the middle of Nigeria, in the pissing rain, with the sun setting, freaks me right the fuck out.
It’s pushed me to try to get the bike serviced and in tip top shape before I leave Ghana. And Cape Coast seemed the ideal place to do it.
But, nothing ever seems to come easy, even here in Ghana; half the parts that I had FedEx'd across from Europe to do the job got detained by Customs in a place called Accra, Ghana's capital.
According to "Priscilla" at FedEx, the Ghana Customs want 150 bucks worth of "duty costs" to release the package - the value of the stuff inside the package is only worth 200 clams itself...
I smell bullshit.
I had to buy a phone - against my will - and break that solemn, drunken oath I’d sworn back in Barcelona to *not* do so until I was "lying on the floor in the fetal position, crying for want of a phone".
Anyway. I ended up hurling abuse down my new (old) Nokia brick at my mate Priscilla, for about an hour each day, for *days*, trying to get her to do her bloody job and get the package released, or at least explain to me how the fuck they justify charging a 75% customs duty when the other package, nearly identical, came through without being charged a single cedi.
Despite being an assertive bastard these days it’s still nothing doing, other than making Priscilla very upset.
Stupid African bureaucracy crap.
Fucking incompetence.
So it's time to go give Priscilla a piece of my mind, in the flesh.
---
My poor bike...
It's been gently encrusted with ocean spray for three hundred and thirty six hours straight. The less noble metals have rusted out something fierce. The bike’s gone from looking "like lamb dressed as mutton", clean through the "vintage" phase, and over into the "rusted bucket of shit" column.
Not too happy with that...
*Time to go...*
---
I peel out.
I never saw Richard conscious; even though it's been weeks...

## Chapter Twenty Five
Accra.
The capital.
Smells vaguely of stale piss.
But I like it. Couldn’t say why – it sure ain’t the fragrance - but over the last few days I've felt at ease here.
Maybe it's "Porschia", the girl who sells me my rice and fried chicken lunch and dinner everyday...
Porschia is *ridiculous.* Her and Fatu from Senegal (remember her?) could have a death-match over who is the biggest bombshell in West Africa. It'd end in a tie... Porschia is another one of these freaks of nature; one of these girls where you just shake your head with a smile and say "well that's just *stupid*".
Which makes this next bit funny: I *know* the glad-eye when I see it, and Porschia has been *pouring* it on; she even took time out of her shift to watch me shove fried chicken into my face. *That* keen. And I don't know why; I don't get it; it really makes no sense...
I've *become* the intrepid destitute; I *am* Marco Polo's arsehole. That's *me*; the homeless looking guy on the park bench watching the ducks from what feels like lifetimes ago.
Put simply; I look rough as guts.
Yet I feel like at any second she'll vault over the table, slap the chicken out of my mouth and *ravage* me.
It's almost frightening levels of glad-eye.
I'm *suspicious* even; *what's in it for her??* She can't possibly be in it for the looks. And I doubt it's my sparkling personality...
And so, for reasons that even I don't understand, instead of fanning the flames I hose them down.
I can almost *hear* the collective groan of all of my mates: *"What the fuck are you doing??"*
---
Moving right along...
It turns out that I can do what the plebs at FedEx can’t do; I’m in and out of the Customs building with my parts - and not a cedi spent - within *fifteen minutes*.
It’s bitter sweet; I’m happy to have the parts and proud that I could get it done myself, but at the same time I want to shove them up Priscilla’s arse.
Useless *fuck.*
I get a good, healthy dose of perspective on the way out when I hear the news that Boko Haram – a terrorist group in Nigeria – has just bombed the Nigerian capital of Abuja and killed 88 people.
*Fuck.*
Cue the worried messages from family back home.
Better get the bike into some *seriously* good nick...
---
After a day of hard looking I manage to find a proper, legit, modern garage.
Through some sweet talking I convince them to lend me one of their motorbike hoists for a couple of days as well as free reign of the workshop.
It’s filthy, *reeking* hot outside, and in this metal death-box - without a hint of a whiff of wind - it’s *beyond*.
It’s so hot in here I can feel the heat in my *eyeballs*.
I get cracking.
The whole bike slowly comes apart, stuff gets tinkered with, cleaned, looked at, shoulders are shrugged, stuff is put back, stuff is swapped, stuff is replaced.
Anything that’s not covered in oil gets covered in my sweat. Lots of both. It's a greasy, sweaty hot mess. My clothes are all soaked through. The sweat drips off the end of my nose like the beat of a metronome.
There’s an exhausted, grimy grin on my face.
It’s incredibly satisfying stuff; doing an honest day’s work with your hands. I get to stand back at the end of the day and say "There it is... Today, I’ve achieved *this*."
I reckon that’s what was missing in the old desk job. The *realness*; clearing an "AC15 assurance milestone" on a multi-billion-dollar project isn’t anywhere near as satisfying as changing a spark plug.
---
It takes me two full days of sweat and work.
I finish satisfied; I ride out *thrilled*: the bike has *never* ridden better. It's never felt more powerful, never *sounded* better.
I’m grinning like a simpleton as I give it the beans.
Two days work; job well done.
---
Boko Haram have now kidnapped three hundred school girls from a village called Chibok. It makes worldwide headlines.
If I wasn’t freaked out about Nigeria before, I sure as shit am now.
And the family back home are managing to be even more freaked out than I am; if that’s even possible.
I have one last chicken with Porschia and peel out of Accra.
I head for the hills.

## Chapter Twenty Six
*Wli* is something of a gem.
A tiny village in the "Volta region", with a decent waterfall close-by and a glorious, trek to the “upper falls”.
The hiking track is a well beaten one, not too technical, but enough to keep you on your toes, and steep enough to get me drenched in sweat in the baking humidity; it feels like I'm in a yum-cha steamer, and the track feels like it just keeps going and going...
It’s wonderful to be outside, free and alone in nature again. The forest is full of trees, and the trees are full of creepers, and that means a dense, closed-in green everywhere you look. The ground around my knees is thick with butterflies, bringing their own dancing colour to the show, and once every now and again you get a little peek through the canopy above to see the waterfall, and a peek through the canopy below to tiny *Wli*, way off in the distance.
A truly beautiful part of the world, and I have it all to myself.
For a time...
I cross a group of white, sweaty, flustered, tourists coming back down the mountain, being led on by a local. When the guide spots me - gallivanting around by myself - I get stopped and asked where my guide is. There’s a fair bit of anger and shock when I reply that I don’t have a guide. I'm told that it's against the rules and that I *need* to come back down the mountain with them.
*I don’t think I will, thanks.*
This is nature, for fuck's sake; not a theme park. Much of my enjoyment is coming from the solitude and freedom in this beautiful place; of doing it alone, and seeing these groups of tourists is already cheapening it enough for me without having some "guide" along.
I wish them a nice day, and crack on.
*Fuck ‘em.*
---
I pass about three or four groups in the two hours or so it takes me to get to the top, each guide getting more and more shirty at me, so much so that in the end, when I get asked “Where is your guide??” I tell him “he’s right behind me...” and keep going on.
When I finally get to the foot of the "upper falls” - the end of the line - there are a group of tourists mucking around in the pool at the bottom of the waterfall.
It’s a bit of a bummer not to have the whole place to myself, but it’s a nice enough spot to sit down and soak up the serenity.
I take a long, deep breath. Life is *good*.
A young local bloke comes storming up to me, he’s really, *really* pissed off, and I can sense in the way he's marching over that he’s been waiting for me...
He stands right over me, *crazy eyed*, right in the way of the waterfall.
“You! Where is your guide?!”
“Hi! What’s your name?” I hold out my hand from my sitting position.
“My name?? My name is Wisdom!” That's a bit odd... “Where is your guide!?”
“Wisdom? That’s an interesting name. Nice to meet you Wisdom.” We shake hands, but it doesn’t shake off any of the vitriol. “Beautiful day today don’t you think?”
“Where is your guide!?”
“I don’t have one.”
“Illegal!! This is illegal! You have no permission! You must pay!”
“Of course. No problem.”
“Yes, good, you pay me now.”
“No, no. That’s ok. Thanks. I’ll pay back at the bottom.”
"No, you must pay *now!!*"
“No, but thank you, I’ll pay at the bottom.”
"It's illegal!! You pay now!"
We go in circles, in varying words, on the same theme, with elevating volume..
On the fifth go of the merry-go-round something snaps in him, like, *really* snaps. He flies into a *rage* and then stalks off.
I finally get to enjoy the waterfalls...
Nope.
*Here he comes again...*
He gets right in my face. “Is it true that you don’t have a guide?”
What?
That’s an odd question...
Ah! I see... he’s got his phone out, and he’s trying to subtly record the conversation. Silly dickhead. Trying to trap me with an admission of guilt.
I won’t play his game.
Fuck you, Wisdom.
“I’m just trying to enjoy the waterfalls, thanks.” And a smile.
"Do you have a guide!?"
“I’m just enjoying the waterfalls, thanks.”
He goes *wild*.
“I have the *right!* by *principle!* to search your bag! By *principle!*”
What’s the bag got to do with it?
“No, you have no right. It’s not happening.”
“You will pay a penalty! *Three times double!!*”
“What? No I won’t.” Peanut.
He goes off. Completely crazy. Ranting shit I don’t understand, and I get the feeling that this is going to come to blows pretty soon if I don’t pay him.
I capitulate.
Fifteen cedi’s. Six bucks fifty, just to walk in nature.
What is the world coming to?

## Chapter Twenty Seven
I’m woken at dawn by every fucking rooster in the village having a cocker-doodle-doo off.
*Dripping dread.*
Must be a border day...
Togo.
Tiny, but a scary country none-the-less. It’s the birth place of black magic and voodoo and all the rest of that weird shit. I’ve been told by a few people that my ears will be valuable there - *very* valuable - so I should be careful.
*Sounds great.*
---
*Wli* is right on the border; the border post itself is just a short ride up the road.
I head straight to Immigration, get immediately stamped out.
The only hassle I cop is a friendly point at the bike from one of the Immigration guys saying “you give me this motorbike”.
Easy peasy, Japanesey.
On the Togo side of the border, getting the passport stamped is equally easy. There's no Douanes though (yep, back to French), and the cops who are doing the job of Immigration direct me ten clicks down the road to a village named “Ndigbe” where I can get some papers for my bike.
---
The middle aged bloke manning the post will issue me an LP for 6,000 CFA. Fifteen-ish dollars.
*Deal.*
When I give him a 10,000CFA note he - of course - doesn’t have change. No doubt in the hope I’ll leave him with a creamy 4k.
Nope.
So to break the deadlock we head to the “bijouterie” - which I imagine is French for a "corner store".
On the way he asks if I can buy him a water. *Sure.* Why not?
We get to the store and I buy a couple of big bottles of water to crack the ten. The lady only has one bottle, and while she’s running off to grab another my mate casually reaches into the fridge, grabs a beer, cracks it, and starts pouring it out into a glass.
*It's 10 in the morning...*
I see what he’s getting at...
“voo meh ashtray”. *You buy me*. Great.
“Non non, shae voo ashtray de low”. *No no, I buy you water.*
“Say le mem”. *It’s the same.*
“Snay par. Par la mem shos. Voo ashtray.” *It’s not. Not the same thing. You pay.*
To his credit he doesn’t fight me.
The woman comes back with the change, I give him his 6,000 and head off.
Into Togo.
Cool.
---
I’m stopped almost immediately at a roped checkpoint, manned by three cops. There's no way past.
*Great.*
I pull up and shake hands, not stopping the motor, nor getting off the bike, nor taking the helmet off.
One of the cops does a lap of the bike, and I can hear him over the motor, standing behind me, making a big deal about the UK number plates, and how I can’t come in without Togolese number plates.
*Ridiculous.*
I ignore it and hope he’ll let it go.
He comes around in front of my face and says that the bike’s no good without Togo plates.
I pretend that I don’t really cog what he’s told me. Instead, I turn off the bike, get off, and de-helmet. I’m *melting* in this leather jacket.
I take the initiative back and run the normal distraction tactics of asking for directions.
They answer the question with the obvious answer; there’s practically only one road in this country, so that’s their recommendation.
The ruse hasn’t worked, I can tell they want to get back to the number plates.
“Bar bar bar bar *Onglatear*...”, which means "something something something something *England...*"
I cut him off right there. “Wee! Exactament, Onglatear. Jevay par: Onglatear, Esscoss, France, Belgie, Suisse, Italia, Espagne...” I proceed to rattle off the whole list onto my fingers, not leaving out the smaller countries - like Andorra - or the countries that I spent an hour in - like Italy – or the countries that aren’t recognised as legitimate by everyone – like Western Sahara - and the list has become quite a big one. *Twenty* in all. And I take my glorious time to sound them all off. I finish with a jazz hands: “tout par cet moto!!” *All with this motorbike*.
No one say's boo about the plates being illegal after that...
Fuckin' *boom*.
They ask for my papers, and they get the usual treatment of only getting what they ask for, but they end up wheedling out of me the whole gamut. *Everything.* All of my papers are out and everything is being checked and re-checked, right down making sure the frame number, all seventeen digits of it, match what’s written in the registration papers.
Blokes like this are mugs.
While they're looking about for more stuff to try to hang me on, I’m putting my helmet back on and starting the ignition. No one’s given me permission to go, but they get the hint that their time's up and give me my papers back and lift the rope.
I'm not fucking about these days...
*Off we go.*

## Chapter Twenty Eight
Lomé.
I don’t reckon I’ve ever had a better first impression of an African city.
*Big call.*
It's a small city, built on the coast, yet modernish. A tidy city.
Cheap Chinese motorbikes dominate this place in massive packs, with forty to fifty all creeping to the space in front of the cars at the traffic lights (traffic lights!!), and they swarm away like a hive of angry bees on green. It’s awesome to be part of the pack, and I ride about town just for the fun of it.
*Street food is back.* Hallelujah. Walking the streets after dark, I'm well and truly spoilt for choice. Lots of decent food at a decent price. Lomé's got it in spades.
The streets teem with the sound and colour of people looking for a feed. The place has a real *vitality* to it. There are smiling, colourful, big mammas everywhere, selling the good stuff to the clientele sitting on their wooden benches, bowl in hand.
The scale is serious; the steaming drum of rice is too big to hug your arms around, and yet it disappears. *Fast.* Such is the turnover.
There are huge pots, up to ten of them - the biggest pots you’d have in your kitchen - all filled with mysterious, steamy sauces with meats and vegetables and who-knows-what.
It’s all shades of brown and green.
The trick is not to ask what it is, or even to think too much about what to choose. Just stick to whatever is popular with everyone else, never mind how it looks; it’ll be fuckin' delicious.
It’s still customary to go back for seconds of the sauce with your left over rice - at no extra charge, of course.
Fuck I love this.
Just never mind the fact that the bowl and spoon you're eating with has been fished out of a tub of barely-soapy brown water... Ignore that.
More food than you can eat for just under a dollar.
I stuff my face with it while having friendly conversation with the locals. Different language, same question: “You like this food, hey?”
Yes. Yes I do. Very much so.
If that doesn’t take your fancy there are big avocado/guacamole and kidney bean sandwiches in French baguettes, heavily salted - which might not sound great, but trust me, it’s delicious. Crazy good.
It’s all washed down with mangoes and pineapples and powdered coffee with condensed milk from vendors on wheels for around 20 cents each.
*Outstanding.*
I fucking *love* it here.
---
A young local bloke at the hotel reckons I ain't seen nothing yet, reckons he knows the *best* street food joint in town.
His name is Kys. Like, "kiss", but not...
I don't like him.
He's always immaculately dressed in a white shirt and he won't leave me in peace whenever I'm at the hotel; he hangs about me like a bad smell.
Despite him being nothing but friendly there’s just something about him that gets my back up. Sets me on edge.
I've been giving him smokebombs for days, but he’s nothing if not persistent and eventually I have to cave in against my will and accept his invitation to dinner.
We head off into the dark.
Instead of heading straight out to the main street he takes me on an unnecessary detour down an unlit, tight alleyway.
My eyes take an age to adjust after the bright lights of the main street.
And then I can see...
The alleyway is *full* of prostitutes.
*Choc full.*
I *know* they're prostitutes; for one there’s the dress code... and they stand in their door frames in a way that only a hooker can.
Every eye is on me as we walk through. Burning holes in me.
I’m trying to casually keep on with conversation to Kys about the football, but my mind and my eyes are whizzing about, looking out for danger from somewhere.
My wrist gets *latched* onto by a fucking claw and a woman screams “whiteman!!” right behind me, right in my ear.
I spin and wrench my arm off whatever’s got hold of it, ready to start swinging limbs and screaming and running all at once.
My attacker is a sequined prozzie. Scared the *shit* out of me. She’s got a look on her face like I just somehow offended *her*.
*Fuck you.* Fuck this. Fuck Kys. *Get me out of here.*
I’ve gotta give more credit to my instincts...
Wait... *Why is she speaking English??*

## Chapter Twenty Nine
Hold your breath; I need to talk about visas, and it's messy.
So.
There’s no "diplomatic mission" for Benin - the next stop down the line - here in Lomé; neither Embassy nor Consulate.
*That could be a problem;* without a visa there’s nowhere else to go except Burkina Faso to the north, followed by Chad followed by northern Nigeria. That's a shit option, the kind of shit option that’ll put a dent in your day, and maybe another one in your head...
I’ve assumed that - like everywhere else - there would be a diplomatic mission of some description in the country next door. It makes sense; you want to have an embassy for your neighbours, y'know, for diplomacy.
And it's *always* been like that. But not here... Fuck it.
So that's one drama. The next one is that the only country down the line that I have a visa for is Nigeria, which comes right after Benin. And because there's no Embassy for the country after Nigeria (which would be Cameroon) here in Togo, that means I'll have to get *that* visa *in* Nigeria, and waiting in Nigeria for visas - with the added chance of being rejected and therefore stranded - isn’t my idea of a good time.
But here's the rub: *I don't really have a choice.*
Well I sort of do; there *is* the possibility of getting transit visas...
Transit visas are just that; visas that let you transit a country, and no more. They're normally valid for only a couple of days; just enough time to get from one end of the country to the other. They're measured in *hours.* And they're not a sure thing; I'd be at the discretion of the border goobers after I've already immigrated *out* of the country I'm coming from.
Could be a fucking shitshow.
Yet, for Benin - with no embassy here - it's my only shot at getting in...
In case things weren't rosy enough, there's another problem: Gabon - the next country along the line from Cameroon - is *notoriously* difficult to get into; they just *don't* give out visas.
All this has killed my appetite for doing shit at the last minute, so I've decided to get as much of my shit in a pile when I can. And right now that means hitting up the Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo embassies here in Togo, even if those two countries are fucking *miles* down the line.
So there you have it; the joys of overlanding.
---
*What a pain in the dick!*
I *finally* walk up to the gates of the Gabon Embassy, *way* out of town. Took me three hours to find the bastard. Like a deaf person playing "Marco Polo", the directions from these locals are *worse* than useless.
*But I'm here.*
The security guard stops me at the big steel door in the big concrete wall.
"Non," he points at my feet, shakes his head "non."
*Won't let me in without shoes...*
*I'm gonna blow...*
---
There and back again and there again.
A hundred and twenty dollars for a stamped bit of sticker in the passport.
No references.
No supporting documentation.
No having to make up lies.
*I'd make that deal.*
Gabon: done!
---
Next: the Democratic Republic of Congo (or DRC for short).
I’ve heard that getting into DRC is a crapshoot at the moment; travellers getting turned back at the border, even though they have a proper visa and everything.
Apparently the rub is that the visa *must* match the travellers country of residence. Why? Fuck knows...
That'd mean having to fly home if I was going to do this properly.
Or...
I could just pretend I'm a resident of Togo...
I don't *look* like a resident of Togo...
Might as well have a crack. Can’t hurt to try...
---
Another morning fucking lost on a fucking goose chase through fucking Lomé.
Deadset sick of this shit.
Immigration. I've made it. Finally.
Had to come here anyway; the clock is ticking on my Togo visa, so I've got to get that sucker extended. Figure I can get two birds with one stone; visa extension plus residency permit.
I barge in. The joint's packed.
I get handballed from one official to another to another to another...
My French is fucking *useless*.
I'm finally informed that I never needed to extend the visa, as the clock only started ticking on it when I stamped in at the border, not when I was issued it. I'm not convinced... The fact that the dopey bastards keep pointing at my Ivory Coast visa like it's my Togo visa doesn't inspire confidence.
They don't have anything to do with residency either; for that I'll need to talk to the cops.
In other words, I've burnt another fucking day for nothing...
---
The cop shop.
I walked all over town looking for the fucking thing when it was on the same fucking street as my fucking hotel.
I've fucking had it with this shit.
I can *see* my hotel from here, for fuck's sake.
I get stopped at the gates at the front by a bunch of grunts lazing about with big guns. Folks are coming and going all the time but *I* get stopped.
I tell them I'm here to pick up a "permit de residence".
*Come right in...*
One of the grunts who's taken me under his wing wants a copy of my passport page, my address, and my mum and dad's names.
*That’s it?*
Oh, no, he wants cash. Of course. 8,500 CFA. Twenty-ish bucks. Which is actually quite a bit. It’s obvious that this isn’t going to be done “on the record”.
*Fine by me.*
---
I head back there after the prescribed three hours and - *there it is* - my official, stamped and sealed Togolese residency permit.
I’m now a permanent resident of Togo. I have the paper to prove it.
That was *way* too easy.
I make the rookie error of not bringing correct change, and end up having to part with 10,000 CFA, but I don’t really care, and don’t exactly want to make a fuss with the cops about getting change back for a bribe on an ill-gotten residency permit.
So, *that* now opens the doors for that DRC visa.
*Excellent.*
---
In my dreams I'm carefree. Happy.
Sleep is my happy place.
I cling to sleep as I sense it slipping away from me - all too soon.
My eyes unwillingly open a crack, and I can’t place where I am. Groggy. Confused for a split second.
Then I see the familiar mosquito net that looks like a prop from a D grade slasher movie, covered in streaks of mosquito blood; the spinning, wobbling fan; the peeling paint and the smashed window. And the dream vanishes and reality becomes clear, and hot on its heels comes a sense of foreboding, dripping dread. That grips me and crushes me from the instant my conscious mind starts turning the cogs - before I’ve moved my head even a smidgen on the greasy pillow.
*Another day.*
I don’t want to get out of bed. I never do.
I’ve gone from feeling liberated by Africa to feeling imprisoned by it, entrapped by it.
It’s been a nothing seven days. Every day; lugubrious, sedentary living. So depressing. Seven days in Lome is many too many.
The next stretch, in terms of both my safety and of the shit I’ll have to come up against absolutely terrifies me. The danger, the arguments, the conflicts, *the confrontation.*
JB's not going to make it before I hit Nigeria. It's going to have to be me. Solo.
I'm not sure I can...
I haul my arse out of bed and fetch food.
---
I watch the planes fly overhead with envy as I eat my breakfast of hot rice and beans and pasta. I wish I could get on a plane and leave. I’m tired. Dirty and grimy, sweaty and tired. But the option of going home isn’t an option at all. Never has been. Never going to happen. I couldn’t do it.
---
The pleb at the DRC embassy gives me a knowing smile when I pull out the residency permit on request, as if to say "well played".
No other questions asked.
It sets me back around ninety bucks. It's got a wicked kind of embossed finish on the coat of arms, which is a first. A pretty pimpin' visa for a piss poor country.
Nice one, DRC, I’m impressed.
So that’s that *in the can* then. DRC is a long way off but it’s good to feel like I’m making some sort of progress.
But it’s left me with a new problem; that I’ve only got five blank pages left in my passport.
*Not a lot.*
I don't think I can fit ten more countries in there...
While I'm on a roll, I might as well try getting the Angola visa; it's outrageously far down the line, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
---
Heading to the Angola embassy wasn't even worth the effort; they close the door in my face pretty quickly; *the ambassador is out of town.*
Angola, by the way, has *nothing* to do with Genghis Khan. That's *Mongolia*...
Different.

## Chapter Thirty
Off to the Benin border.
No visa, and no idea what’s going to happen...
Time to roll the dice. I’m nervous.
Togo is such a geographically skinny country that a street sign at a roundabout points to the right and says “Frontière Ghana” and points to the left and says “Frontière Benin”.
Whichever way you turn, you end up in a different country.
Left it is.
---
I get out of Togo easily enough. I ask anyone I come across about whether or not I can buy a Benin visa on *this* side of the post, so that I don’t get stuck in limbo between the countries if they reject me.
“Non. Pas ici.” Okay, that’s expected, I guess..
"Eh la cotay Benin?"
“Non. Pas la aussi” What?? I *can't* get one on the other side either??
"Pour-qua?"
“Ce necessare d'allay a Lome.” *Everyone's* been saying that; I can't get it here, and I can't get it on the Benin side either; I have to go back to Lome...
*Fuck.*
I *know* that there’s nothing that I can do back in Lome; they don't have a fucking embassy there...
I’m gonna have to just suck it up and take my medicine...
---
I'm greeted with the Benin flag, and a cop. He stops me and demands my passport. He’s not gonna be happy that there’s no visa... Here we go...
*But no...*
He’s more interested in where I’ve *been*, fingering slowly through my passport, page by page, asking about the countries, always replying with - and I'll skip the French - “On this bike?”
“Yes.”
“Aigh!?”
“Yup”
“This one?”
“Uh huh. This one”
He lands on a new page. “Nigeria!?”
“Yeah”
“On this?!” he points at the bike.
“Yup.” He shakes his hand like he burnt his fingers.
“You need a visa?”
“Erm, yeah, yeah I do.”
“Come.”
---
It's a fucking *breeze.*
Unbelievable.
Transit visa, pasted and stamped. Which now gives me precisely forty eight hours to leave the country again. 10,000 CFA, which is about twenty bucks.
Forty eight hours to Nigeria...
*I should be more careful what I wish for.*
The Douanes didn’t ask me for anything other than the bikes rego to write me up a laissez-passer.
*Love that.*
I skate away into Benin after a pretty well organised border, with 16,000CFA spent – about 33 bucks in all – with full papers.
The whole damn thing was pretty quick and painless; most of the drama was happening between my ears...
I think there’s a lesson in that somewhere...

## Chapter Thirty One
Benin is as much of a midget as Togo – only a hundred clicks wide – so getting across it in a couple a days wasn't a stretch.
In a blink I spent one night in a place called Cotonou, and now I'm Porto Novo, just a short jaunt from the Nigerian border, trying to sleep.
So... Here we are.
*Nigeria.*
The traveller’s nightmare.
The place has been scaring the shit out of me for months now. It's been playing on my mind ever since I decided to have a crack at Africa. And now that it’s finally here I’ve really whipped myself into a special kind of frenzy for this one.
Now, to be fair, I've been mildly scared of every country that I've travelled through. So crapping myself now is nothing new; every single country has been spooky just because it is - at the least - an *unknown*.
But Nigeria takes the cake. Steals the show.
Let me tell you why I can’t sleep.
To safely negotiate Nigeria is like walking a tightrope. If you fuck it up and fall to the north side, you land on those fun Islamist extremists, *the Boko Haram*, who - I’ve found out - have actually killed *thousands* of Christians in the last year.
The kidnapping of the school girls and the bombing of bus stations at the capital that I'd heard about a few weeks back is just a ramp up of what’s been happening for the last five *years*.
*Scary shit.*
According to the Boko Haram, "Western education is the root of all evil". They want to carve out their own country in northern Nigeria that will have *Sharia law*.
Not a fun bunch.
If they’ve been happily massacring their own countrymen it doesn’t take much of an imagination to think of what they’d do if they got their hands on a foreigner like me...
So. Avoid the north...
But if I accidentally stray too far to the south I'm still equally in the shit. On *that* side of the tightrope you have pissed off locals who have had a gutful of Western oil companies polluting their Niger Delta (a “delta” being a huge river system) with big oil spills, and then not cleaning them up.
It's destroying their livelihood, which was primarily fishing.
So, as a new livelihood, they kidnap and ransom the oil workers.
Two birds with one stone, right?
Again, not a fun bunch.
Yet, between these two mutually exclusive yet equally unpleasant peoples there is, allegedly, a strip of the country that's *Goldilocks*. That's where I want to be - not too Muslim extremist, not too kidnappy, but *just right*.
While I can’t sleep, let’s stew on some more Nigerian fun facts.
It's the most populous country in all of Africa.
One in every five Africans is a Nigerian (mind: blown).
It could be called the world capital for corruption and fraud. You've probably got a few of their emails...
It's got a reputation for violent crime.
There’s practically a violent “coup d’etat” every time there’s an election.
I've been told to watch out for "stickmen", people who ambush cars using clubs of wood with a nails through them as weapons...
The capital, Lagos, is currently the third most populous city in the world, and is predicted by 2025 to take the top spot.
As I write this there are, give or take, twenty two million people in this single city alone. The entire population of my entire home country just happens to be the exact same number. Every person in Australia – Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Hobart and everywhere in-between – all in one place.
It’s doing a number on my head.
And I’m not sure if I can do it; it's the compounding weight of the number of people who have told me along the journey that it just "can’t be done". *Under no circumstances*.
My emotions make a quantum leap, straight from terrified despair over to hope, from gut twisting nervousness straight over to being excited as a kid on Christmas Eve, and in the click of a finger straight back to fretting.
I'm living in the extremities of the pendulum without a moment spent in the middle ground. And as the night wears on it's wearing me thin.
Lagos is my first stop.
*Twenty two million...*
It’s right on the other side of the border; there’s nowhere else to go. I don’t even get to dip my toe in the joint till I have to dive in the deep end.
Forecast for tomorrow: Thunderstorms.
I’m not even joking.
You wouldn’t know it just looking at me, but I can’t stop the tremor in my fucking hands. 
I feel like I’ve had 10 cups of coffee, and maybe something illicit to go with it.
They won’t just sit. And every so often the bloody thing runs from my toes right up to the top of my head and then back down again, like I’m shivering, even though I’m sweating my arse off.
*Fuck this.*
---
I wake up.
I come to my senses.
*Today’s the day.*
As I realise where I am I’m more than a little proud that I somehow managed to sleep, but the pride is gone in a flash and I pick up just where I left off the night before.
Time for the shit to start hitting the fan, and not stop hitting it till I’m in Cameroon, *covered* in shit.
I feel like I’m back at school, with some sort of awful public speaking in front of the class to do.
Or like I’m about to do my driver’s license test.
It’s that feeling, but on a whole new level of jitters.
*Gut wrenching.*
There's nothing left to do but to do it.
Like ripping off a band-aid.
Up I get, and go through the motions of a normal day in the saddle. I don’t reckon I can stomach a breakfast though, not today...
Before I know it I’m on the highway, staring up at the blackening sky, and wondering what’s going to fall apart first; me, or the clouds...
---
The border post isn’t a goddamn thing like I was expecting; the other Benin border of two days ago has clearly given me unrealistic expectations.
*This* is a dog’s breakfast.
A whole bloody village has popped up on the Benin side just to feed off the post.
*That's a bad sign.*
I’m joining the dots that it means that lots of people pass through this post, and that they probably spend quite a bit of time, and money, trying to get through.
The street is completely choked.
I’ve got to waddle my bike through the crowds at a crawl, with the crush of noise and people towering over me, sitting on the bike.
*You’d hate to be claustrophobic...* It's even worse than the Ivory Coast / Ghana border.
Inch at a time I make it through to a lowered boom gate, where I park up the bike and head over to the hut next to it.
It’s the Beninese Police.
Despite the buzz of people outside, in here it's just a big kahuna, an assistant, and me.
The big kahuna is sitting behind a desk. He’s a thickset big lad, somewhere in middle age. He's in full dress uniform; hat and everything.
He doesn’t look too happy to be here.
I give him my passport to get stamped out and sit down in the chair opposite him.
He barely looks at my passport, and is more interested in my bike papers. I don’t know why; *it’s none of his fucking business;* I’m not *coming* to Benin, I’m *leaving*.
I protest, and say I just need the passport stamped, *thanks*, but he’s insisting on seeing the papers.
What can I do?
I give him the papers.
He demands 20,000CFA for me to take the bike through.
That’s about $40. And that’s total bullshit. *It doesn’t cost a clam* to take a bike *out* of a country.
But, I can’t leave without this guy giving me the exit stamp in my passport; it’s the one and only thing I need on the Benin side.
He takes my “Je ne comprend pas” - *I don't understand* - as a language barrier thing, and I’m happy for him to think that.
My only shot is to hope that he gets sick of asking me. So I get comfortable in the chair for the game of patience and thousands of “Je ne comprend pas”.
And back and forth we go...
He’s quickly getting the shits with me.
That’s good. I think...
And then someone else comes into the hut.
*A white girl.*
I can’t believe what I’m seeing...
Legit.
*A... White... Woman...*
In her thirties, maybe.
And she's doing *this* border.
And I thought *I* was mad...
Along with a healthy dose of perspective, she brings into the tent a question in too-fluent-French for me to follow. The cop points to her a direction, further down the road, and she leaves without another word.
*Wait a second...*
The penny drops.
That could’ve been in Chinese and I couldn't have mistaken the meaning.
*I've got this bastard.*
My French improves considerably, and I ask the cop if I even get the stamp *here*. He just says I have to pay him 20,000CFA, and nothing else, but there’s a note to his voice that he isn’t so sure of himself anymore...
Game's up, fucker.
I snatch my papers off the desk and jump out of my seat and walk off, folding the papers and tucking them into my inside pocket as quick as I can, and say over my shoulder that “je par pour le tampon eh jarreev. Daccor?” *I go for the stamp and come back. Ok?* 
This could go one of two ways; sail through, or deep shit.
I’m followed out onto the road, but I'm not manhandled. It’s feeble protests rather than demands.
*I’ve won...*
I walk past the bike towards where he directed that white girl.
He catches up to me, walking ahead like an escort, saying something I can’t catch.
I take the chance behind his back and turn on my heel, and head back to the bike, pulling on my helmet as I walk.
By the time he cogs that he's walking alone and comes running back I've already got the motor started.
I put out my hand, stand the bike up, flick the kickstand, and shake his hand.
“Merci pour votra assistance.” *Thanks for your help*.
He looks more sad than anything else...
I ride to the boom gate blocking my path and bypass it through a pedestrian path off to the side.
*A lucky break.*
At the next boom gate along I cop the exact same shit; to get the bike out I need to pay.
*Why all these fucking stops and boomgates??*
This time the cops cave-in early, pointing out to me where I can get my passport stamp.
I leave them with my motorbike papers to mull over and head to where they’ve directed me.
It’s a random, standalone, single "stall". Unmarked. It looks like a cinema box office got lost and dumped in the middle of nowhere. In amongst all this sound and noise and movement, and all these different buildings, it seems like it’s being deliberately obscure. Playing hide and seek.
There’s a crowd of people around the reflective perspex sheet, all trying to jam their passports and money through the small semicircle gap at the bottom.
I eventually muscle to within an arm’s length and shove my passport through the gap.
I barely make out the muffled sound of someone on the other side of the plastic asking where my money is.
"Shon ay pa." *I don’t have any*.
The passport gets an exasperated stamp, and thrown back through the hole.
Hallelujah! Done!
I walk back to the boom gate and the fuckers with my bike papers want to give me the shits about my carnet, or rather, my not having one.
But I don’t need anything from these guys. *Nothing.* But I do need my rego papers back.
I’m all smiles. I explain why I don't need a carnet, using my bike papers as part of the demonstration, I pick them up off the table, show them an irrelevant detail of the rego, and then fold them up and put them in my pocket.
Like a fucking magician.
They don’t protest, but try to hook me up with a Nigerian fixer.
No thanks. Catch ya later.
I pass the boom gate through the pedestrian side track again, muscling the bike through the crush of people.
I’m out of Benin.
I wonder how badly that would have shafted me if it was my first rodeo; my *first* border crossing... Pretty hard, I reckon. Wouldn't have been pretty.
Even though I know what I'm about these days, I was *still* just leaves in the wind. Only luck got me through.
If I didn't know shit from shoe polish I would have been stuck there for a bloody long time.
Well... That’s the easy part done then...
---
I roll into the Nigerian side, and I’m baffled.
*Lost.*
God knows I’ve done a lot of border crossings, but there’s never been one that looks like *this...*
It’s just so *busy*. There are different stalls spread out willy nilly, pell mell, everywhere.
And I mean everywhere.
Three parallel mud roads, full of buildings and stalls.
Fuck. There must be more of them than I can count on my fingers *and* toes...
A border *should* have three essential services; Immigration, Customs, and Police.
That’s it.
*What's going on here then??*
They’ve all got signposts with different names and acronyms that aren’t making any sense. And they should be making sense: the language in Nigeria is English.
I find something that, to my eye, looks police-ish, and a little immigration-y. Plus, it’s busy, and that should be a good sign that it’s something that everyone needs to get done.
I muscle in and chuck them my passport.
Bullseye.
My passport gets stamped without a single question, and not one single demand.
How refreshing.
The bloke in the stall next door harangues me, and he won't let me go. He's from the “secret service”. He wants to see my passport. It’s definitely unusual to have a "special police" presence at a border, but it’s not a first. In the past they’ve only ever taken down my passport details and that’s it.
So he gets my passport, writes down the details, hands the passport back to me, and then demands “dash”. A bribe.
He cops a flat rejection and a walk off.
How have this mob not figured out yet that the time to ask for money is while they're holding something that I need, *not* after they've given it back to me??
Anyway, Customs time...
There’s a small booth down the mud road with "Customs" marked out in the name. There's two surly looking middle aged women behind it.
I see on the walk up that there’s nothing on their desk to be issuing a TIP with - stamps and papers and whatnot - so I ask where I can go to get a TIP They point out to me a shipping container about a football kick away.
They get really, *really* shitty at me as I walk off without giving them any money.
---
The shipping container marked out with 'Customs' is all closed up...
Maybe not the right place? A random bloke nearby tells me it’s not open when he sees me staring at it.
"Why not?"
"It's a public holiday today."
"What? And they're shut?"
"Yes."
"Righto... Fuck. Where can I get papers then?"
"Not today."
*"Not today??"*
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
My brain crunches out the three possible outcomes of not having an TIP for the bike today. And none of them are good:
A) Leave the bike behind and come back tomorrow, fingers crossed.
B) Stamp out of Nigeria, go back to Benin, say hi to all the people I just pissed off and try to get them to let me back into the country, then do it all again tomorrow.
C) Chance it - in *Nigeria* - without any papers for the bike. 
Suboptimal...
I *hate* this shit.
I tell the guy that that’s not possible.
He points me out another shipping container - also marked Customs - but with some acronym after it.
*What's the difference?*
I go over and poke my head inside.
It’s dimly lit inside, and with the dark clouds outside it doesn’t make things too easy to see. Despite the dark inside the bloke behind the desk is still having a crack at reading the paper. He must eat a lot of carrots...
I step over the threshold.
I make introductions, shake hands and explain the situation. He asks for my carnet. I explain that I don’t have one. And he flatly rejects me.
No carnet, No TIP.
What would be the point in getting a fucking TIP if I had a carnet already??
I ignore that and throw up the usual tactic of verbal diarrhoeaing all the places I’ve managed to go without a carnet, all with no problem.
He thinks about this...
"Let me talk to my boss."
Good. That’s progress.
"The boss" is out of "the office" for a bit, so I head back to the bike while I wait.
The bike is always easy to find: it’s wherever the crowd is.
I always feel like I bit of a rockstar when I get there, like, "yep, it’s mine." It always gives me a kick when I fire her up; no one ever looks at it and thinks it’s going to make such beautiful music.
I roll her over to "the office", and wait.
---
An hour comes and then goes. I eat a banana. Every time I stick my head back into the shipping container I get the same answer: "soon".
I'm thinking that in the meantime I should probably be using my time efficiently and changing some money over into the local "Naira", but I’m not sure that revealing how much I’m packing is such a great idea. I'm not ready to reveal my hand just yet...
Halfway into the second banana I’m called into the container: "The boss will see you now."
The boss’s office is on the other side of a partition in the shipping container, and he’s a she.
A round of applause for progressive Nigeria.
She flat out rejects me. Carnet, again.
*Fuck.*
There’s no other way that I can do this... It *has* to work. I *have to* have a TIP.
I start talking again, the same usual spiel of countries done without the carnet.
When I get to the end of that she gives me a squinty look with her lips smushed into a thin line. Considering.
“Ok, no problem.”
I have to stop myself from punching the air and tap-dancing.
*You little fucking ripper!*
She gives the ok to the newspaper man outside and he goes to write me up a TIP. “You need to pay the bond, you get it back when you come back.”
"When I come back? But I’m going to Cameroon... How does that work?”
“Cameroon?”
“Yeah, Cameroon.”
“You’re not coming back here?”
“What? No. Why would I?”
“You must come back here. Cameroon is no good.”
*Sheeeeeet!*
I give a shrug of the shoulders and he tells me to wait while he takes it up with the boss.
I’m right back at square one. After getting so excited, this feels like a kick in the teeth.
I’m sick of worrying and fighting for this shit...
After what feels like a long time he comes back. It seems that without a bond there’s no actual issuing fee, so they’ve decided to skip the bond and just give it to me *for free*.
*Fist pump.* Can't help it.
He takes my details, takes a forever to write up what must be the most detailed TIP anywhere in the world; three full pages of the stuff. Stamps everywhere.
“Now, you give me something, eh?”
Done. Fair enough. I don’t want any drama, or to get rejected after all that, so I give him 6,000 of my CFA, the usual high-end price for a LP – about 15 bucks worth – and we’re done here.
*That’s a wrap.*
I pocket the papers and shoo away the gathered mob from the bike.
I slowly ride through the rest of the border post, with various people giving me a loud “PSSST!!” or a half-hearted “Hey!! Hey!!” trying to get my attention to see if I’ll stop for them. But I know I have everything I need and to stop for anyone else could get me into some more drama I don’t need.
No one steps up to forcibly stop me, and I’m through the last barricade and into Nigeria.
Gotta smile. I'm in Nigeria. *This is ridiculous.*

## Chapter Thirty Two
Early impressions are surprising. It’s all agricultural space and farm land with the occasional small village.
*Where are all the people?*
What’s *not* surprising is that there are checkpoints.
*Lots* of checkpoints.
More checkpoints than any place I’ve ever been to, by a long way.
Hands down.
I've done the math, I'm passing a checkpoint roughly every five clicks.
*Every five clicks* there’ll be a mob of blokes standing around in some variety of camouflage, with big fuck off guns. Occasionally they have a nasty spike strip.
Mean looking bastards.
They seem to be stopping folks at random.
And I stand out like dogs balls...
There’s no trees on the side of the road, so I can spot a checkpoint from a mile off; well before they've spotted me.
The traffic’s thin, but there’s some vehicles plodding about. So every time I see a checkpoint I find something bigger than me – a car, a van, a truck, a mob of other motorbikes, whatever – and sit in the checkpoint's blind spot. I figure that I can use the “screen” to get past without being seen, or, alternatively, if my screen gets pulled over or I get spotted, I can just pretend that they were trying to stop the other vehicle - my screen - and hope I don’t get shot by some trigger happy army goober on the way out.
*They won't see me till it's too late to stop me.*
---
It's worked beautifully.
From the twenty checkpoints I've counted in the hundred odd clicks to outer Lagos I’ve either not been spotted, ignored, or even given a wave through.
In only two of the twenty was I ever noticed. They *tried* to stop me - with lots of yelling and blowing of whistles and waving of whatever was to hand - but they were too late to get in my way.
I didn’t stop. Of course.
Despite it all going *far* better than my loftiest expectations, it didn’t stop me from holding my breath for all of them. Each and every time I'd only realise that I was out of breath when I came out the other end with no holes in me.
I had to pant to catch my breath; my heart smashing in my ears each time.
*I wish I was handling this better.*
The skies are grey, but not nearly as ominous-grey as the thunderstorm’s that were predicted.
It's all working out so well.
---
The green agriculture quickly gives way to built-up dinginess.
The further I go into it the thicker and dingier it gets.
Traffic starts to get cloggy.
With some creative riding I get through the micro-jams caused by taxi-vans stopping on the side of the highway to pick up passengers.
I nearly get my fucking head taken clean off by some truck driver who decides to open his door while I’m cutting through one of the jams. I manage to weave the bike a tiny amount to the side and tilt my head a fraction the same way - all in a split of a second - while the door swings open. Like The fucking Matrix. Didn’t even have time to swear. The truck door missed my helmet by *nothing*, a moment later and I would’ve taken it full in the face.
Decapitated.
A head in a helmet.
Nothing surer.
As I look in the mirrors, the truck's door is right where my head used to be.
"Mother-*fucker!*"
At the next micro-jam I decide to just wait it out in the traffic...
---
It starts to sprinkle rain.
The traffic's going at a half-walk half-jog.
Between me and the never ending line of tinned shanty shops on the side of the highway, there’s a section of mud about a good spitting distance wide that's running parallel to the highway. I wonder how deep it is... I wonder if I should have a crack at it and ride on the other side...
*It would be quicker...*
Sizing it up, I spot someone lying in the mud a ways off ahead.
In the mud... *Nude?*
I can see as I get closer that they're only in shorts, and the *shorts are around the knees...*
*What??*
Face down, bare arse to the sky.
I move forward and closer with the traffic.
It’s a young kid, a teenager based on the height, but I can only see the back of his head from here.
He hasn’t moved since I’ve spotted him...
*What the fuck is going on here??*
My eyes flick from him to the traffic and back to him.
Is he begging? Going for pity money, maybe? *Surely.*
I roll past.
I'm turning my head to him and back to the traffic and back to him and back to the traffic.
Fuck. Whoa. *Fuck...*
He’s dead.
I reckon.
I can't look back again. I wouldn't learn anything new, and I'd crash.
*Do I stop?*
I run over what I just saw in my head again. His head is twisted around enough that he’d be uncomfortable if he was alive... He’s only got about half his mouth out of the wet mud.
He didn't move. *Not an inch.*
Either died there or dumped there...
Nah. *Surely not...*
How come no one’s *doing* anything? People are walking past him at the shops, people are driving past him in their cars.
No one gave him the *slightest* attention. As much attention as if it was a dead cat...
*Fuck.* If no one cares that must mean that it’s par-for-the-course here; dead bodies in the fucking mud.
*What the fuck am I doing here??*
This was a bad idea. All of it.
The only thing that’s brought me here is fucking inertia. And that’s a rubbish reason to do something as brain-dead as this.
I’m going to die in Lagos. In the mud.
How will Mum find out?
How will *anyone* find out?
What if no one *ever* finds out?
Suddenly, a realisation hits me like a bag of shit in the face: I didn’t do a *thing* about it... I just rode on by.
*Self, self, self...*
I wrack my brains; I can’t think of anyone else I’ve ever seen dead...
It’s a first.
My tension ratchets a notch.
---
The dingy build up dissolves, and gives way to the *magnificent*.
The truly magnificent.
Surprising. Delightful. *Utterly* unexpected.
Mag-fucking-nificence.
Old clogged streets turn into pristine new highways of fast moving traffic, ramping up into *huge*, sweeping, art-like flyovers; weaving up and down and around each other, over and over, like the bridges are dancing; dancing, connecting islands in the sea.
They explode out of each island like fireworks over the water.
It’s fucking beautiful.
On the islands are cities like nothing I’ve seen in West Africa.
A megalopolis; I don't have another word for it...
Sky scrapers on one side and a massive port on the other. It’s like a surreal, living, “Matchbox” car set, but in real life. Sim-fucking-city.
Almost futuristic. Definitely modern.
It’s nothing like the dingy, half-derelict "cities" you’ll find in Dakar or Abidjan, neither does it have that feeling of a “past glory”; the skyscrapers look modern, as do the pristine shopfronts lining the minor streets that branch off the highways.
The city is *immaculate.*
There are even people walking around sweeping *sand* off the streets.
I was expecting a sprawling, monolithic slum; *way* off the scales of my imagination in size, density, and decrepitude.
*That’s* where I set the bar. This is fucking *Lagos*, after all.
I’m not sure that my expectations have ever been more thoroughly wrong in my entire life. I’m thrilled to be wrong. Couldn’t be happier.
Once I feel like I'm central enough, I pull out of the flow of the flyovers and go shopping for accommodation.
---
It’s expensive.
By my count it’s about three times pricier than anywhere else I’ve been on the continent. I haggled like a fiend for two shitty hotels and don’t get anywhere near the price I’d like to hear for either of them. I’m too pigheaded to accept the inflated price, despite the fact that the afternoon’s getting on a bit.
Other problems: I’ve got *no* local money, and I’ve only had two bananas to eat all day...
I roll up to the YMCA (yeah, they’ve got a fuckin *YMCA*, bizarre).
I try to get a good price for their shithouse, filthy dorms. I fight tooth and nail for a better deal than 2,000 naira - about 15 bucks - but I’d be better off haggling with a wall.
My stomach yields. I pay.
I chuck my shit in the room, and wheel the bike through the YMCA's reception, and out into it's big, empty, safe courtyard.
The bloke running the joint cracks the shits it at me. Says can't keep it in the courtyard...
*Seriously?*
What does he reckon? That I’m going to keep it out on the street??
Yep. That’s *exactly* what he reckons.
And that’s a deal breaker. Fuck you.
This is the first time that I’ve ever been told to keep the bike on the road.
Ridiculous.
It doesn't make any *sense*. There’s *nothing* in the courtyard. It's enormous. And the place isn’t exactly popular; I reckon I’m the only person staying here.
So why does the bloke give a shit??
I try everything I can to convince him otherwise, but he - frustratingly as hell - won’t see reason. He’s sticking to his guns: my bike isn’t allowed in the courtyard. Full-stop. I reckon this guy’s got a mate he’s gonna call tonight, who’ll liberate me of my vehicle and cut my new buddy in on the proceeds.
Unless he’s going to nick it himself.
That’s the only explanation I’ve got for this retard; that he's tee-ing me up to get fucked; nothing else stands to reason.
I’m on the knife's edge of loading the bike back up with all my shit and riding off with a finger in the air. But I don’t know where else I could go, I’m out of ideas. And *properly* hungry.
And that’s the syncher.
I roll the dice, and roll the bike back out the front.
---
Today, nineteen people were killed by a car bomb in the capital, Abuja.
Boko Haram. Again.
Has this been happening this often, this bloody, this regularly, forever? Is it just that I’m here now, and paying keen attention to it, that I’m hearing a lot more about all of these attacks? Or is this a new thing?
It certainly seems to be the flavour of the month; with the abduction of the three hundred school girls in Chibok really making a splash in the news.
It’s curious, because it would seem that no one here - actually *in* Nigeria - particularly cares.
Couldn’t tell you why.
There’s also some “intelligence” that I’ve caught wind of that Boko Haram are going to bomb Lagos. Soon, they say...
Anyway, the car bombing puts the nail into the coffin of the idea to head to Abuja to grab visas for the next countries. Which means that the embassy for Cameroon here in Lagos is going to have to stick, or bust...

## Chapter Thirty Three
I'm up early. Edgy.
I pop my head out the front door. The bike's still there...
I'm actually surprised to see it.
I was starting to dream how nice it would be if it got nicked and I could just fly home...
I grab my papers and get walking.
There are twenty two million people in this city, but I’m left wondering where they all are; the streets are practically deserted.
Normal? Or ominous?
It’s definitely eerie.
I have that feeling I've missed something important. Again.
Anyway. I play deaf Marco Polo with anyone I can find, and I've managed to locate the Cameroonian Embassy. Is Cameroonian even a word? Dunno.
I’m greeted at the gate by a man who looks like he’s never smiled in his entire life. Not once. Child, adolescent, man; never a smile.
I’m unceremoniously rejected.
I'm not about to be rejected by a fucking *guard*...
I wheedle my way through and talk to someone who knows what they're talking about.
I’m unceremoniously rejected, again; they won't issue me a visa here. Why? They won't say.
Apparently, I need to try my luck in a place called "Calabar", which is the Nigerian town next to the Cameroonian border.
So I find myself with a very empty day in Lagos.
What to do?
---
Money.
I find a money changer and get all my CFA exchanged for Naira, all at the correct, official rate. I don’t even haggle for it... It’s the first time that this has ever happened, and to have it happen in Lagos, well, that’s pretty friggin suspicious. But it’s all there... I study the notes; where most currencies would have a picture of the head of someone important on it - like kings, queens or presidents or whatever - here they have a picture of an oil rig. The pride and joy of Nigerians everywhere...
Hilarious.
The notes look fine. Guess I've got to stop looking this gift horse in the mouth.
---
Breakfast.
It’s rice blended with beans and spaghetti and a mysterious brown sauce. The "protein" is a small, brown, fried fish that's been bent back to bite its tail; which makes it look like a petrified, coiled up turd.
On my plate.
They say that you "eat with your eyes"... Not true; it's all delicious.
Time. To. Wander.
*Why not?*
I know it’s not smart, but my curiosity is outweighing my fear and my rationality.
Curiosity killed the cat, sure, but the rest of the cats are boring. What did I come here for if not to see something new?
This place hasn’t been at all what I was expecting and I want to see more of it.
I orient myself in the direction of the biggest tower, and walk.
---
An hour of walking.
I’m still wondering where everyone is...
I’ve walked kilometres of main roads, over the bridge from Victoria Island into Lagos Island, and now I'm going down the wide main streets - between the big modern towers - and the place still feels *empty*. I can’t make heads or tails of it.
After some more aimless walking I find the "market quarter" of town, nestled in the shadows of the skyscrapers.
I’m still not sure that this is a good idea to head into it... Might land me in the shit; if there are unsavoury sorts here - *and I know there are* - then this is surely where they’re gonna be.
But, on the walk this far I’ve been surprised with how little hassle I’ve been getting. *I copped worse in Morocco...*
I was expecting people to be looking at me like “Hey, who’s the guy with the death wish?”, but it looks like no one really gives a shit.
*I feel confident about this.*
I head in.
---
*This* is more of what I was expecting.
Grimey and muddy and tight and loud and claustrophobic.
People. *Finally.*
It's not too far different to anything else I've seen in other African capitals; same people flogging the same shit with the same sounds and the same, *ripe*, smells. The only difference is that this one is massive.
*I can’t believe how well this is going.*
Other than getting a few looks, which, being honest, is pretty normal, no one’s giving me a shred of grief.
I can’t believe it. It’s supposed to be *Lagos*. This place - which has been the source of all of my dreamed up worst nightmares - is turning out to be a *cakewalk*.
Shouldn’t someone be stabbing me right about now and making off with my earlobes? Where are all the guns and gangs??
The megalomaniac cynic in me reckons that they’re all here, but they’re not messing with me because they’ve come to the conclusion that for me to be here all by myself I must either be as hard as a coffin nail, or completely insane.
I hope that's true. Makes me feel like a wild man.
---
I’ve still not popped out the other side, or even looked like popping out any side of anything. It’s all still mud and crush and loud noises in cramped, claustrophobic spaces. I've been walking for a *long* time.
I should have popped out *somewhere* by now, but I’m still in here.
All at once I realise that I don’t even know which direction I’m facing anymore... *Fuck.*
Have I been walking in circles? The walls of buildings are crowding in on all sides so I can’t see any landmarks, or towers, or even where the sun is in the sky. I've got no way to get my bearings back.
From what I can tell from down here, the alleys have been weaving about like a psychedelic maze. I thought I was going in straight lines, but maybe I’ve been slowly turned about...
My isolation hits me all at once; even in this madhouse of people I feel all alone.
The crush of people and the loudness of it all aren’t helping me stay level headed.
*I wish I had my compass...* But I’m not even sure that would help me at the moment...
I want out of here. I want out *right now.*
Now now. *Get me out of here*.
I suppress an urge - a strong one - to break into a little jog-walk.
I walk. Fast.
And then faster.
I'm about to break into a jog - despite myself - when I spot the top of a sky scraper *way* off in the distance.
*Thank god!*
I lock onto that direction; that’s my bearing.
I stay locked in, but I lose that when the alley forces me to go off in a direction I didn't want to go.
I try to hold my bearing again, but it's all so confusing. *Nothing is straight*.
I'm lost, again.
I don't dare let anyone know that I'm lost. It'd be too easy to be taken advantage of.
I walk in my best guess of a single direction, and walk, and walk, and walk...
---
The market opens up, and I burst out onto an open road in full sunshine.
Thank *Christ*.
I suck in the air and try to calm the fuck down.
With the sun back I can get a rough idea of the points of the compass - a very rough idea - but I've got no fucking idea where *I* am. Zero. With all that walking I could be anywhere...
I take a guess; south.
And set off.
---
Another hour.
I'm wigging out.
*I hate this*.
Hate hate hate hate hate...
---
*I've been here before.* This place...
I look around me.
I have.
I have I have I have.
I was on this road yesterday on the bike...
It's enough.
I'm done.
I'm going to find my way home.
*I survived the market quarter of Lagos.*
Weirdly, I feel a sense of both achievement and of being short-changed.
But if you’d told me just a year ago while I was back in the sky prison that in 365 days time I’d be walking - alone - through market quarter Lagos in Nigeria I wouldn’t have believed it. I’d have said you’re full of shit.
Funny, the turns life can take.
Lagos has been one giant surprise, but tomorrow it’s time to move on.

## Chapter Thirty Four
The bike survives two days and nights on the streets.
What are the odds?
Getting out of Lagos is a breeze.
Instead of going through all that shit like I went through on the way in, the exit out to the east has a bridge over the ocean that hugs to the shape of the mainland, and just goes and goes and goes. Bypassing everything.
From the bridge it looks like the mainland of Lagos is one massive, uninterrupted, derelict slum.
So *that’s* where everyone is.
There’s your "whole population of Australia in one city" right there.
I’m starting to wonder about the "authenticity" of my Lagos experience.
But I'm not about to turn back just to see what the slums are like, just for "authenticity".
Shit, I'm happy that I don't even have to ride through it to get out of this joint...
Onward to Benin City; don’t ask me what Benin City has to do with the country of Benin. I don’t know. Probably nothing.
Anyway. Let’s see if we can’t find the other hundred and fifty million punters here in Nigeria. I bet at least one million are policemen...
*This is going to be shit.*
---
Nope.
*Nigeria strikes again.*
I'm loving being surprised.
I'm not far from Benin City, and all I've seen on the ride is a sparsely trafficked, decent, two lane highway, lined by dense, thick greenery of overarching canopied trees and other green stuff.
Nothing but green. The whole way.
It's been one of the nicest rides of the whole trip...
Unbelievable.
Who’d have thought it? *Nigeria*, for fucks sake.
*Where are all the people??*
And the whole distance there’s been only one checkpoint.
*One!*
And, true to form, I rode straight through it. No worries.
I can't believe any of this. Every single one of my expectations and prejudices against this place has been completely, utterly wrong.
My only thoughts now are with the bike. Tuned in through my ears, hands, feet and arse to every note and vibration coming from it.
I worry about a persistent "jolt" that I feel every now and again in the foot pegs. It's like someone gives the bottom of the footrest a little whack with a hammer every now and again.
Curious.
Sprocket and chain?
Maybe...
There's fuck all I can do about it while I’m riding, so I really ought to just forget about it and enjoy myself.
It's twenty odd clicks to ride till Benin City. I’m feeling good, surprisingly good, fresh even, given it's been a long day in the saddle; three hundred odd clicks and maybe five or six solid hours of riding since Lagos. Despite skipping lunch I’m not even feeling hungry. The miles and time has somehow just breezed right on by.
---
I’m flying along at a clip, pulling out and overtaking a couple of slow moving big trucks - halfway past the first.
*Ping*.
In my brain.
It almost makes a noise.
*I can’t think.*
My thoughts lose focus. Then disappear. 
I feel weird.
I feel dizzy.
*What’s happening??*
My eyes lose focus.
I can’t see straight.
I can’t see clearly.
Suddenly, unpleasantly *drunk* all over.
Oh fuck it’s all going fuzzy.
*What is this???*
The points at the side of my jaw go sour, then tight.
*I’m going to be sick.*
*Boom!* Adrenaline! *Fizz!*
*I’m going to throw up in my helmet.*
Keep going. Roll on. Roll. It’ll pass it’ll pass it’ll pass...
Gasping. Lungs heaving.
Head lolling.
My heart revs.
Everything feels straight, but the bike starts sliding to the right.
*The world* moves to the right.
To the right. To the right...
It won’t stop.
To the right.
I pass the second truck.
My body moves in my mind - and my senses tell me the bike should straighten - but not in the world. It doesn't happen.
The world rotates slowly the other way.
The bike keeps drifting, right, right.
I can’t stop it.
I can’t move.
*I'm going to be sick.*
I’m going to collapse.
I'm fucked.
*Am I dying?* 
Am I fucking *dying*??
Brakes.
Brakes!!
The whole world is flying in queasy cartwheels to the right that snap back to upright. Again, again, again...
We stop.
I put the bike, somehow, onto the stand, to the left. 
*Swoon...*
What happens after I black out? In *Nigeria*...
Where will I wake up?
*Will I wake up?*
The helmet comes off.
The jacket.
I walk. Stumble. And I breathe. *Deep.*
Frantic. Eyes wild. My face scrunches itself up.
Oh fuck. *This is it...*
I’m fucked. I’m fucked fucked fuck. 
*What is this???*
---
It comes off. Slow.
I don’t throw up.
I stay awake.
I pop my ears; squeezing on my nose and blowing pressure into it to equalise my eardrums. I don’t know why I'd do that. 
Each second, each step, I’m a little further from the edge.
A little further from the floor.
The bile receding. My jaw still feels sour and clenched.
The vision slowly focusing. 
The storm’s passing.
Still dizzy.
Still can’t walk in a straight line.
Still can’t *think* in a straight line. 
*I don’t feel like me...*
Not myself...
What just happened?
What do I do *now?* 
*I can’t stay here...*
But to ride on... I can’t barely *walk* straight, can’t see straight, can’t think straight... I can't ride like this...
What else can I do? Call for help?
I get on the bike, and I ride.
---
I can control it enough to keep it upright and moving forward.
My breathing won’t take care of itself; something feels very wrong. I don’t think I’m breathing properly on my body's autopilot - so I take over myself.
In, out, in, out, in, out...
I hyperventilate; My arms and nose are tingling with the overload of oxygen.
I stop the bike again.
---
I go again.
I stop again.
I go again...
---
I only just start to feel normal again as I pull into Benin City.
I can think, a little.
*I can't believe I made it...*

## Chapter Thirty Five
*What the fuck?*
What the fuck was it? What the fuck does it mean?
I ponder over a crappy late lunch in a crappy, unpopular, dingy restaurant.
Something’s not right, no doubt about that. And it *still* ain’t right, even now I’m not feeling quite like myself.
Blanking out and then nearly blacking out altogether, while doing nothing but riding a motorbike. That shit ain’t normal. At all.
Brain?
Diet?
Anaemia?
Blood-sugar?
Iron?
Calories?
Cancer?
Brain cancer???
Malaria?
Parasite?
Something crawling through my brain, chewing stuff?
I could’ve picked up one of those fuckers any one of a hundred different ways...
Hookworm? Aren't they the ones who latch onto the bottom of your foot, dig through, get into your bloodstream and head to the brain and start eating? Or laying eggs or some shit?
I’ve been walking in nothing but thongs for *months...*
What about "vertigo"? A fucked up inner ear? My mum had that once; she woke up one night and before she knew it she was flat on the floor, world spinning in her head. Couldn’t stand up without pitching over. Lasted *days*. Nausea. Uncoordinated. Feeling like being on a roller coaster when sitting still... 
*Sound’s familiar.*
Even if what just happened was a bit milder as far as symptoms go, the consequences of unexpectedly falling over are a fair bit different when the floor is moving under you at eighty clicks an hour...
In outback Nigeria, for fucks sake.
Fuck I hope it’s that though; vertigo would be a very neat and tidy cause – one that won’t kill me. That's my favourite part about it...
Typhoid?
Haven’t been feeling crook...
I don’t know.
What to do?
Do something? Or do nothing?
I'll wait and see what happens next...
---
I keep getting interrupted in my morbid daydreaming and shitty lunch by people wanting to talk to me, coming up to say hello, despite what must be a fucking sour look on my face.
The conversation each time feels less like a friendly chat and more like an interrogation in some of the worst pidgin-English I’ve ever heard - almost unrecognisable as English at all; at most I’m getting a couple of words out of each sentence.
What I do manage to catch is roughly this: Where you come from? What name you? Where you stay? What hotel? You tell me. Tell me. You have phone? What number? You give me this. You give me your email.
Erm. *Fuck you?*
Seriously, shake my hand and then try to shake me down for info, shit like that.
You can all get fucked.
Could be all innocent curiosity - maybe - but the tone and body language would seem to wipe that out.
I feel like I’m being "cased". And it gets my back right up...
One bloke even asks me what my hotel *room number* is. And when I say I don’t know he say’s “we should go there now.”
All this is giving me the willies...
I was feeling pretty tender already, without needing to deal with this shit.
I turn myself into a bastard. A complete arsehole. A right cabbage. Rude fucker. Essentially telling them in fairly short words to give me some space.
But these jerks are nothing if not persistent.
I chow down the shithouse lunch, pay, and leave.
One of my new “friends” won’t leave me be, won't stop tailing me.
I give him some stern words, but even that's not enough. I head to the markets and shake him off in the crush.
I spend the rest of the afternoon locked in my room, staring at the ceiling. I watch as the worlds loudest, loosest ceiling fan threatens to fall out of the sky and maim me spectacularly at any moment.
What a delightful day it's been...

## Chapter Thirty Six
No excuse to stay in Benin City.
None that I can think of.
I’m surprised how fresh I feel after yesterday; even with the fan keeping me up all night.
Anyway. I’m fine. It’s all fine. It’s all going to be fine.
Plus, it’s a perfect overcast today that’s going to make for comfortably cool riding.
I force myself to saddle up and take off.
*Get on with it.*
---
It's been a pretty unremarkable day, thank Christ.
The only point of interest has been the huge lines of cars waiting hours to get petrol. There’s some sort of fuel crisis going on here; in a country with so much oil that they put oil rigs on their paper money. Go figure.
The shanty towns of yesterday have changed into well-ordered small cities. If I squint and stretch my imagination just a little I could almost pretend at times that I’m in a western suburbia.
Very un-African.
There were five and a half checkpoints for the day. I snuck past one and a half; got seen a mile off for another two, didn’t stop but didn’t exactly get waved through either; and openly and flagrantly busted two, to much yelling and excitement in my mirrors.
The “half” checkpoint was an un-uniformed man carrying an AK-47, stopping cars that were forced to slow down for a short stretch of narrow road full of potholes.
*Pretty sure that's not legit...*
Christ knows what he was doing to the cars that he stopped. I’m just glad he was already busy with a car when I snuck past.
I’ve still been holding my breath for each and every checkpoint.
I've crossed the Niger River.
Welcome to old *Biafra.*
The day ends in a place called Enugu.
I copped some light headedness today, but no full blown “episode”.
Enugu’s alright.
I shack up.
---
I get fucked on lunch because I didn’t haggle the price in advance; having already eaten the food, I was at the wrong end of the stick, with no leverage.
They charged me ten times what it should have been worth.
I wanted to vomit it all up on their counter... I flew off the handle, yelling daylight robbery, but they wouldn’t budge.
*Lesson learnt;* same way that cops shouldn't haggle for bribes after they've given me back my passport, I shouldn't haggle for food once I've already swallowed it all...
Spent the afternoon in a local flash hotel using their interwebs for the cost of a coffee. Brilliant. And air-conditioned too... Mum's freaking out back home because the U.S. have intel that a terrorist group is planning to bomb the Intercontinental Hotel in Lagos...
Reckon that’s fair enough to be freaking out over...
I’m more worried about the weather; it’s forecast for thunderstorms. All week...
Two good friends of mine got married back home, it’s happening right now, and I’m sad to miss the occasion and the celebration.
I miss my mates.
---
After sticking around longer than was polite after only buying one coffee, I head back to my dingy shoebox as dusk is settling to stare at a wall or read a book or something.
The lady running the joint tells me that I have to leave; I can’t stay anymore.
*What? Why?*
They’ve double booked the room or some shit...
For some reason my brain hits a small panic button, and I have a little bit of that fizzing, dripping dread go through my system.
My back is well and truly up.
There’s no one even staying in this shithole, for fucks sake!
I tell her that I’m not leaving - won’t leave - the other bloke will have to leave.
I smell a rat; or some scam to get me up to a more expensive room or something - some sort of extortion. 
The hostess is having none of it. She won’t budge; I’ve got to go. She tells me that their rooms are all booked and I'll have to go to the hotel across the road.
She wants me to move hotels when it's getting *dark*.
*Is she insane?*
I fight, hard. She insists right back. Again and again and again and again and...
*Fuck it!*
What option do I have anyway?
“Righto, let's go see the other hotel then.”
“No, you take your bags. Now. First.”
*Why???*
I'm still smelling that rat...
“No... I want to see the room first.”
“No, you must take your things.”
I reckon she’s in cahoots with the hotel across the road, and once I get there - with all my shit - they’re going to scam me on the price. Or someone’s going to thieve my shit out on the dark streets... Ambush, mugging.
“No... That's *retarded*... I'm not taking *anything* till I see the room.”
Back and forth we go. Again and again and again.
It escalates.
As I walk out the front door into the front courtyard - *without* the bags - I'm fucking *fuming*. Pissed right the fuck off.
It's getting dark - *quickly* - and they're kicking me out of the hotel without so much as a fucking apology.
She's chasing me, haranguing me about the bags.
I turn right around and spray some serious vitriol.
There’s finger stabbing.
I’m sure that I’ve *never* spoken – yelled, even – in this tone before *in my life*.
Let alone to a woman.
I scare myself. For some reason I’m reminding myself of my dad when we were kids. It’s weird that I would channel him giving us a verbal lashing when we’d be in some seriously deep shit, but there you go. *Analyse that...*
Anyway. I’m fucking out of there - storming across the road - with my sparring partner reluctantly tailing me at a distance.
I barge into the other hotel. I want to kick the fucking door down. I demand a room.
*Fully booked.*
"Fuck!!"
*Are you fucking kidding me.* This is *Enugu* for Christ’s sake. Who the *fuck* is staying in *Enugu?*
I already feel vindicated that I didn't hump all my bags here just to be rejected...
On the walk to the next hotel I apologise to my ex-host for flying off the handle. Hot on the heels of the apology I also explain that I was well and truly in the fucking right due to the clusterfuck we find ourselves in now, going from hotel to hotel, *in the fucking dark*, and that only by sticking to what *I* wanted is it not even worse.
Worst apology ever.
The next hotel is a few minutes walk up the road. The price is something like 6,000 Naira. What’s that? Fuck it! It's too much. I'm out of goddamn patience for math; all I know is that it’s a lot.
I take long strides to the next hotel and leave the hostess in my wake.
The "Gutsy Motel" is a pile of shit. Truly.
*Fully booked.*
"God fucking damn it! Fuck this shit!!"
By the time I’ve stomped to the next joint it’s completely dark outside.
I open the front door and step in. There's no lights in this hotel, so inside it's almost pitch black.
I walk the empty hallways, feeling my way about, hand on a wall to guide me. "Hallooooo??"
*Creepy.*
Someone steps out of the darkness and I crap a cinder block, I scream just a little.
It's the boss.
She has a room. For 3,500 Naira. It's too much, but I'm out of options and out of time and out of light. I take it.
---
I move my shit in the dark and leave the other lot rather tersely.
*Fuck 'em.*
A day of being fucked about, really.
Though, that said, this new place I'm staying in is infinitely nicer than the other joint; my room's got air conditioning, enough room to swing a cat and just generally not dingy feeling.
The odd thing is that it's all in an old shipping container outside the hotel.
*Weird.*
---
The night *pisses* rain. Hoses it with *violence*.
Tomorrow might be a total wipe. A write off...

## Chapter Thirty Seven
In the morning twilight, lying in bed, I’ve got half a foot in sleep, half a foot out. I'm not really here... I cog that the sun is up, that the storm has passed.
Time passes. Who knows how much...
*BANG, BANG, BANG!!*
*Slamming* on the metal front door.
I’m wide eyed and standing naked on my bed like I'm surfing it. Very, *very* much awake.
*BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!!*
I’m up to the eyeballs in adrenaline, *terrified*, as I chuck my hobo pants on and head to the door.
I answer the shipping container door by sliding a metal bar out of the way and pulling back the thick metal door back on its hinges.
There’s a little man standing on the other side.
“Is everything ok?” he has the voice of a munchkin on helium.
“Yes! I’m sleeping. Why?” sharply. I don't know whether to be relieved or pissed off...
“You’re air-conditioning isn’t on...” I have *never* heard a voice like it...
“So??”
“You should turn it on.” Is he fucking serious??
“Ok thank you bye now.” I slam the big metal door in his face.
Jesus *Christ*, talk about your hotel wake up calls.
I go flick on the A/C.
Fuck's sake. I'm gonna need a sedative to come back down.
---
I take a shower and go pay the boss.
She has a hairy chest. Big thick clumps of hair.
*Queezy.*
Anyway. Despite having had adrenaline for breakfast I find it hard to get going. For some reason I don’t have my head screwed on right. I keep doing dumb shit, like totally packing the clothes side of my bags and then realising that I hadn't put my glasses in their case, which is at the bottom of the bag. And then I forget to take a pair of socks out to wear before packing.
*What's up with me today?* I never make these mistakes...
After another few fuckups that leave me shaking my head, I'm onto the bike and out of Enugu.
I’m particularly and uselessly agitated.
I can *feel* that it’s going to be a shit of a day.
Calabar is the destination. It's *well* south of my Goldilocks zone; somewhere I shouldn't be; it's that place where people kidnap oil workers for ransom... but I have to head there to get the Cameroon visa, otherwise there's no leaving Nigeria...
Going outside the Goldilocks zone has me filling the unknown with bad shit: checkpoints galore, stickmen, rebels abducting whitey road users for ransom, no bridge where I'm hoping there's going to be a bridge, no petrol, rain, thunderstorms, a flat tyre, a broken chain, going all fucked in the head and blacking out... I could go on...
I'm as jittery as a dune bug.
The feeling won’t leave me like it normally does once I get going. Won’t wash off with the ride. It just lingers. Always there.
I’m overly focused on my breathing: what is it doing? How am I feeling? Am I ok?
I get hit with occasional light headedness and nausea.
*This isn’t fun...*
I'm not sure if it's me who's bringing it out of myself or if it's a genuine symptom of something else, or even if it's just my freaked out paranoia manifesting, or if it's my new contact lenses that might not be quite right on my eyes, and the effect on my brain is to make me light headed.
I can't figure it out.
When I stop and take a walk it seems to get better.
Then something strange happens.
The thought occurs to me: *I'll be dead sometime.*
One day.
And that day could be today. I could die *today*.
And my immediate reaction is to smile.
To *smile*...
Is that fucked up or normal?
In fact, it seems to happen all the time. When I’m a bit shitty or just having a bit of a shit day, I always think that someday soon I’ll be dead, and *every time* it makes me smile.
Is that strange? That the thought of death leads to a sort of misplaced happiness that brings me to life. The swift onset of death as a way of dealing with your problems? Death as life affirming?
Everything feels trivial now.
*Who gives a fuck? I'm gonna die.*
Empowering, instead of depressing.
Does anyone else do this??
I doubt an octogenarian would find the thought "I could die today" to be empowering and uplifting...
Anyway. I stop for petrol and it’s fine.
---
The road south into the places I shouldn't be ain’t all that bad. There are a few sections that are a bit sketchy, with potholes and some rocky bits, but that’s more of a problem for those on four wheels than those on two, and I zoom on by.
About 20 clicks down the road from Enugu the map on my GPS runs out of road - so I’m on my own. Dead reckoning into the void.
I use the approximate GPS waypoint as the crow flies to help me choose which roads are my best bet to get me to Calabar.
Sketchy, but what else am I supposed to do?
The crux is going to be the river that lies between me and Calabar. Bridge or no bridge... I've no idea.
---
I get to my river, there's a bridge. Fucking beautiful.
Welcome to *Cross River State.*
From here it's a straight shot on to Calabar. 
All up, there were six checkpoints.
I haven't been killed.
No one gave me the shits.
Despite being at the other end of Nigeria, I'm *still* surprised that no one wants to stop me and shake me down. Shit... *I* would stop me and shake the shit out of me.
There's not a single 'stickman' to be seen.
The biggest risk of the day was the trucks; mix in potholes and it makes for some crazy shit.
These lunatics are *flying*, and will use up any (and all) of the road to avoid hitting a pothole - even if it’s not their part of the road to use...
At one point an oncoming truck would have taken me out as he tried to simultaneously overtake another truck, *and* dodge a pothole.
At the last moment, I had to fly off the side of the road to get out of the way of ten tonnes of death.
Happens often.
I, for my part, also ride like a complete maniac. I'll take *any* gap I can. I'll overtake a truck at full speed while another truck is oncoming at full speed, and I'll slide between the two down the middle of the road - three wide - if there's a gap there.
I'll overtake, undertake.
I have no patience, and I don't give a shit.
It makes for some hairy moments.
One in particular made me drop a nugget; a two truck pass – undertaking one truck while it was overtaking *another* truck... The salad in the sandwich.
Halfway in, one of the trucks closes out the small bit of space I have; probably trying to avoid a pothole. It’s funny: the noises that you make without knowing it when you think that a violent death is imminent... It's a primal noise, but still rather quiet considering you're about to meet the maker.
I *almost* traded paint with the truck before I shot out the other end.
If he kept coming across I would have been gently smushed between the two trucks.
This silly game is going to get me hurt or killed if I keep it up...
---
Calabar.
I'm flying a little blind trying to find a hotel.
There are some very, *very* gnarly clouds approaching.
I’ve been lucky so far - and lucky all week, for that matter - to not have copped a single drop despite the ongoing forecast of nothing but thunderstorms.
These clouds look like they want to piss on my parade...
I've been hammering it.
I pull into a hotel, park up under the small awning, and on cue it opens right up.
*Belts* down.
I mean like *hoses* down. Rain so heavy it's a little scary.
Violent enough that you just stand there, in awe, and just watch it.
I'm swearing a little under my breath.
In *minutes* the gutters are overflowing. Not long after that the whole street is a river of water doing its best to find a drain. And *still* it keeps coming on, maybe even a little harder.
Then the lightning and the thunder, *real* close.
Then it starts blowing its arse off.
You'd think it was the fucking apocalypse...
I guess I'm staying here the night then...
---
Got a message from mum. She’s not doing well.
Pretty frantic.
Pleading for me to get out.
Gives me the shits.
She doesn't just want me out of Nigeria, but out of Africa.
Apparently, Ebola and the Boko Haram are both making international news.
Mum is taking it all to heart.
To top it off, in the local newspaper back home the front page was dedicated entirely to the story of a man who was held hostage for nine months in Nigeria.
*Great timing, that...*
Mum has every right to be concerned. But sharks are scarier from the boat than they are from in the water. Odd but true. I don't know why that is, but it is.
I'm more concerned about the murdering I copped last night from a pack of ravenous mosquitoes, who were unleashed when the ceiling fan (ceiling fans seem to confound mosquitoes) cut out when the power died in the middle of the night. Fuckers.
Anyway, I've gotta get my visa. I fucking better... I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't work out; this is the end of the line...
I'm buzzing as I walk to the outskirts of town to find the Embassy.
---
Well, it's a far cry from not even being allowed in the front door in Lagos...
They're very accommodating, and not at all demanding.
It never felt in doubt...
In about fifteen minutes I'm back out the front door, surprised to have a three-month visa for 125 bucks.
*I'll make that deal.*
I can leave Nigeria...
*Thank fuck for that.*
I grab a late and shitty breakfast at about 11 o’clock - three bananas and some peanuts – I’m bloody hungry.
I offload my backpack at the hotel and then head for walkies through the local market. It’s par-for-the-course, with fabrics, fresh produce and horrendous butcheries with blokes slamming huge hunks of animal with machetes, splattering me in the process.
Snails must be a local delicacy here because they’re for sale everywhere. They have shells like the top of one of the towers of La Sagrada Familia. Different!
The ground at the market still hasn't dried from last night’s rain, and I can feel the mud squishing through the plugs in my thongs and into the gaps between my toes.
*Disconcerting.*
Other than the markets, I'm *loving* the outdoor, open air hairdressers. Women are fenced off like cattle and three or four hairdressers go to work on them like a pit crew. It's a spectator sport.
There are a lot of people half-heartedly trying to get my attention today. I just mentally pretend that I'm French; like don’t know a word of English.
Mostly people are just giving me the usual "white man!" as I walk past; more as a statement of fact rather than being attention seeking or derogatory.
The markets don't capture my attention for long, so I head back "home" to the hotel for a siesta.
Tomorrow's a big day...

## Chapter Thirty Eight
Must be playing on my mind...
I’m up, at 6:30 in the morning, unassisted.
Odd.
That’s got to be some sort of record for me...
Well. Good. Might as well get to it...
---
Without anyone to say goodbye to at the hotel I get going at the ripe time of 7:30 - surely another record, I’m not usually even awake yet...
It’s not raining. But it’s pretty friggin ominous. Dark. But maybe that’s just the morning...
I'm quickly off the main road, and onto the road that should take me to the border - I think...
It’s crappy tarmac full of big, deep potholes full of deep water.
That’s no problem for me on two wheels - easily dodged - but the cars and trucks are having a 'mare of it.
---
There’s a fork in the road, it splits out like a wedge, one heading left, one heading right.
Wasn’t expecting that...
I bury my head in the GPS while still rolling, trying to pick one.
The left!
*Bang, bang!*
Woops! Didn’t see that speedbump. Big one too...
There’s yelling coming from my left, I turn my head to see a big bloke taking big, purposeful strides towards me and the bike, *just a few meters away*.
Then he's in my mirrors.
He’s running after me!
Yelling and waving... That's a plank of wood in his hand! *A stickman!!* 
*Ha!*
Sorry mate, not a fucking chance...
I gun the bike and slowly extend the gap. *See ya!*
Down the left of the wedge it’s all new tarmac. Brand *spanking* new.
---
Single lane track, and it’s green all around.
I pass some plantations, some wild stuff - canopying over the road overhead, creating a beautiful, dark, green, tunnel.
*Gorgeous.*
I feel like I’m in nature’s version of a pillow fort; somewhere that feels secret and secure and safe.
The road is forever twisting and turning, going up or down, conforming to the hilly terrain, with the peaks of the hills shrouded in fast moving cloud, getting whisked along with me to Cameroon.
It’s a beautiful ride.
*Bliss...*
Then I pass a dirty big industrial plant or a mine or something. It couldn't be more out keeping with the vibe.
Riding past the man-made-shit, the tarmac road disappears into a red dirt track.
Figures...
Things slow down, but besides the occasional puddle it’s actually not too bad.
What was left of the traffic - if you could call it that - evaporates. All that’s left is me and the occasional small roadside village.
I'll be buggered if I know what they do for a crust out here, this remote.
After I've passed a few I start to notice a pattern emerging; half are very friendly - all waves and smiles and welcoming; I wave and smile back; the other half I leave angry yelling in my wake...
I don't get it; whole groups of people gesturing *furiously* from their houses, "PSSSSST!"ing their heads off.
Of course, I never stop for this type of shit, but I do wonder just what they're getting at.
Do they want me to buy something?
Or maybe just want to have a chat?
Or are they going to hassle me?
*Or worse?*
My biggest concern is that it's legit; maybe some sort of checkpoint or police stop or even a border post where they want to check my papers, where I probably *should* stop to get stamped...
I dunno.
My way of dealing with it is to ignore it. The moment that I hear anyone making a "PSSSSST!" noise at me I don't even look in their direction. Trouble with that is that I can't look at them for clues as to what the fuck they're driving at...
In any case, good riddance to those guys. I’m sure that it can’t be good news, right?
Also, I'm not a huge fan of having *"WHITE MAN!!"* yelled at me.
Shits me.
Kids are exempt, I guess; *they’re* yelling it in pure, unbridled excitement; kind of in the same way that kids might yell *"SANTA!!"*.
As I ponder it I nearly hit a spike strip laid out over the road...
*Stickman!*
It's a very agricultural looking spike strip - planks of wood connected together with rope. The spikes are rusty nails...
*Fuck!* Gotta be a stickman...
Fuck fuck fuck. The spikes cover up the whole of the road; there’s no way around...
I have to stop.
*Shit shit shit shit shit...*
A bloke materialises from out of the green.
*Rough lookin...*
Fuck!
What do I do??
He grabs the rope and moves the spike strip away...
“Where are you going?”
“Um, the border? The border.”
He waves me on.
I ride through.
That was unexpected...
*Weird,* even.
He didn’t even ask me for my papers...
Come to think of it, I haven’t been asked for my papers *once* in all of Nigeria. Not once. How about that? In fact, that’s gotta be a first for *any* country I’ve been to. Go figure.
On the other side of the spikes the red dirt paths turn into steep slopes of really thick, really slippery, red mud.
You can see where all the cars and bikes have had a go at it - deep tyre tracks gouged out of the red clay.
The gentle, thin rain, has given it all the traction of a bar of soap.
It’s a goddamn mess.
---
Progress comes to a stop...
*Slow.*
Each incline, I have to sit for a bit at the bottom of it, size it up, pick my favourite track - or the least worst track - and roll the dice.
The level of control I have over where the bike goes and what it does is purely that of light suggestion, gentle persuasion - the bike is its own animal in this shit - and I’ve just got to let it go where it will, and try my best to keep it rubber side down.
Despite my so called “experience” the bike is still all over the shop, jumping from one rut to another - going exactly where I don’t want the bloody thing to go - moving sideways under me, *very* suddenly, in ways I’m not ready for.
At least twice I should have binned it; it was only by pure luck - not skill - that everything stayed upright.
It's white knuckled shit.
Fucking exhausting.
---
Bang on midday, almost to the second, and I roll into the Nigerian border post at a place called Ekang.
*Made it.*
Already I’m thrilled by my luck at getting an early start this morning; I’m halfway through the day but not close to halfway through what needs to be done to get to the next lot of civilisation.
Rocking up here a couple of hours from now would have been a shit outcome...
I don’t know why they’ve bothered to give this place a name; *there’s nothing here.*
I pull up at a building that looks like it could be something... It's more promising than the other ramshackle looking constructions.
The whole place is deserted.
I jump off the bike and pull my helmet off, and a fat man in his underwear appears from somewhere and tells me that I need to keep going further.
Right...
---
I hit a chained and padlocked wooden gate, barring my path to a bridge crossing over a small stream. *This must be the place...*
It takes me a while to find Immigration; it’s just a white washed building with "Immigration" drawn onto it in tiny letters above the door.
There’s two of blokes lazing around in casual dress inside.
They’re friendly enough, but they don't seem to have a very good handle on what needs to be done. It’s pretty obvious that not many people use this border crossing...
It takes a long time to fill in the required books and ledgers, and I notice that before the guy thwacks my passport he has to wind his stamp forward *three days* first... Yeah, *remote*.
With that done I ask them how I get the gate unlocked. But instead they handball me to some other guy. Buggered if I know what his job is...
We sit down and I hand him my passport, as asked.
He opens a blank notebook to its blank first page(!) and starts taking down my passport details. Painfully slowly. Like watching a six year old write...
Passport Number.
Name.
Surname.
Date of birth.
Place of birth.
Date of Issue.
Date of Expiry.
Issuing Authority...
I’m surprised he’s not going to try to sketch my passport photo…
He turns to me.
"Where have you stayed in Nigeria?"
*What?*
"All over."
"Which hotels?"
"Which hotels?? I don’t remember the names. Why is that important?"
"What dates?"
"Dates? I don’t know... Why do you need to know?"
“I am doing my job.”
He turns to the first page of my passport and starts heavily scrutinising my Benin visa. He spends about ten seconds, carefully reading it before I stop him.
"I'll show you where my Nigerian visa is..." I go to grab the passport.
"No, I want to see *this* one..."
I don’t get it. What’s this bloke on about?
He starts writing down the details of my stay in *Benin*...
*What??*
Does he think that because my Benin visa is the first visa in my passport that it’s the first place that I’ve visited?? Fucking peanut.
“Hey, I don't get it, why is my Benin visa important? What use is this for Nigeria?”
He ignores me.
“Where did you start?”
“England.”
“Where is the stamp?”
“What?? *Why?* That’s not important. There isn’t one.”
“What’s the first stamp?"
“Ugh. Morocco...”
“Where is the stamp?”
“How am I supposed to know!?”
I turn the pages of the passport while he’s still holding it. “See all these countries?” I say, “See all these stamps? If we’re going to match every entry-stamp to every exit-stamp to every visa in this whole passport we’ll be here all *year*. I’ve no idea which ones are for which countries. They’re all over the place. And it’s *not* important. Do you understand? *None of this* is important to Nigeria. I’ve been all over Africa (liar…) and no one has *ever* asked me questions like this. No one. *Ever*.”
He sort of trails off after this. And I think we’re done here. I re-take the initiative. “Do you mind if I see the passport for a second? I just want to see if there’s space for the Cameroon stamp...”
Of course there is... The ploy works. He hands me back the passport and I thumb through it, thoughtfully. I mock-brighten-up “Ah, *yes!* There’s room for a stamp right here. *Perfect!*” I put the passport back into my jacket pocket. The guy looks a little lost. “Thank you so much for your time, you've been a great help and I really appreciate it.” He bewilderedly shakes my hand.
I exit stage left.
*Clever...*
Walking out of the building I smell food, and that's good enough for me; who knows how far I'll have to go till I find food in Cameroon.
I find the local chop by following my nose and wolf down some rice with fish and sauce.
Back at the border gate there are a couple of new blokes "PSSST!"ing at me from outside the Immigration. I ignore them. As far as I'm concerned, we're done here...
A third guy, an ancient bloke, comes up to me and asks me if I’ve seen Customs.
“Yes, yes it’s all done...”
But, the gate is still locked.
No choice, I guess.
They’re sitting outside a locked door with 'Customs' written on it, but that doesn’t mean that they *are* Customs, if you get me. Could be two random blokes just looking for some dash...
“Carnet.”
“I have a laissez passer.”
“Give it to me.”
“Let’s go inside first.” I figure if he can undo that lock then that’ll make it legit enough for me...
“Why do you want to go inside the office?”
“I’d be more comfortable.”
Sure enough, he has the keys.
*Tick.*
We all head inside.
They check my LP and hand it back and say that I can go.
As they’re unlocking the gate for me I apologise to them for trying to ignore them and being a douchebag.
I roll over the bridge and over the stream.
Nigeria; *In the can.*
And I still have my ears...
Never did I ever dream that it would have been as easy as this. Is Nigeria easy? Or was I just lucky?
I'll never know...
---
Cameroon.
*Off to a bad start...*
The Customs office on the Cameroon side of the river is derelict and deserted.
Not too sure what to do about that...
I carry on up the road a bit and see a uniformed police officer taking a slash into the trees.
I park up the bike.
He walks over and puts his hand out. I shake it - trying not to think that he’s just touched his cock with that hand. I hope he didn’t get piss on it. Or has herpes... That gives you an idea of how important the handshake is here; you really can't not do it...
*Anyway.* He speaks English but it's obvious he prefers French. Cameroon is a weird country. I think that half the people speak English and the other half speak French. It's a bit like Canada, except it's nothing like Canada...
We switch to French.
In his pile-o-shit office he explains (I think...) that he can't issue a LP here, but he does stamp me into the country.
He tells me (I think...) where I can find Customs.
It’s in one ear and out the other...
Somewhere further down the track, I suppose.
The whole thing takes longer than it ought to, but in the end I’m lucky to ride into Cameroon with zero paperwork for the bike - he could have easily said to me: "no paperwork, no good, go back.”
But, *I'm in.*
---
Straightaway things are different here.
The road has turned from a mud rush into gorgeous, pebbled, single lane track with green pressed in on all sides. I can reach out in any direction and touch green.
I feel like I'm in a secret again.
The sun’s come out through the thin rain and streaks in beams through the trees.
There’s a magic intimacy to it. I’ve never seen a track like it...
But with intimacy comes remoteness. As time passes, it becomes increasingly obvious that the Cameroonian side of the border is even more sparsely populated than the Nigerian side.
And when I say more sparsely populated, I mean no one at all.
Not a soul. No signs of life. Except for the life of the forest, or is it a jungle now?
Botanical definitions aside, if something goes wrong out here, I’m sort of fucked. No one’s going to come to help. I’m just stuck. And what then?
Not worth thinking about; I'm making good progress.
But I can still feel it pressing on me; the risk.
There’s, what, about sixty clicks to go?
Sixty clicks at a touch over walking pace... Wait. How fast could I walk sixty clicks?? Ten hours. Minimum.
*Shit...* This is reminding me of Mali-ville way back in Guinea, where we took two days to do a route that we though would take us a morning.
Except this time, I'm alone...
*Yuck.*
---
The pebble path gives way back into a fucking mud rush.
We slow right down to a crawl.
*Mud mud mud.*
We're sliding all over the place again.
It's the kind of clayish mud that you stick your boot into and you'll lose it up to the shins. Try pulling your foot out and that's all you'll get, a foot; the boot stays in the mud...
*Sucky*, thick, sticky mud.
It’s knackering.
There are puddles all over the place. I try my best to avoid them; they make a mess. But sometimes there's no getting around them.
*Gotta go though.*
I come up to one, a lighter shade of the colour mud. It's about as long as I can kick a football...
I pick the least shit of the two possible paths and hit it as fast as I dare.
Halfway through and I'm making a mess, and then the bike just fucking *disappears* on me; like I rode off a cliff; the front wheel dives deep into the water and the back one follows it in a moment later. I hold onto the handlebars like a goddamn rodeo cowboy.
"*FUCK!!*"
The loud bang of the exhaust note turns into a bubbly dribble as it goes under, but we keep going forward - and down.
I wring the throttle. *If I lose momentum we're fucked.*
We're making a wake like a boat. Any deeper and it's gonna suck water and we're *proper* fucked...
*Make it make it make it make it!* Come on!
The bike rises like Lazarus out of the water and the bubbling dribble turns into a coughing bang again and we’re out the other end, *soaking* wet.
Jagged one there. *Bigtime.*
Shit; I hope that didn’t flood into my bags...
I hit another big puddle. I spot a big fuck off tree branch in the way after I'm already committed to the tyre rut.
Can't avoid it! No stopping, no turning, no avoiding, just go.
*Foomp-Whack-Thunk-Crack!!*
Foomp! The stick goes under the front tyre. 
Whack! With the sheared off pointy end coming flying through the crashbars of the bike.
Thunk! Right into the meaty part of my shin.
Crack! The thick part of the tree branch gets fulcrum-ed in the crash bars and then snaps off like snapping a twig with your thumbs...
I come out the other side dragging half a tree branch with me.
I check my leg; another few inches of tree and the pointy end would have gone clean through my calf.
Impaled.
Speared.
*Still hurts like hell...*
No damage though; bike's fine too; branch could have gone whack-thunking into anything...
Dead-bike and dead-me probably mean about the same thing right now...
We crack on at a crawl. What else am I going to do?
Clayish red slippery *shit.*
I can’t relax for a single moment.
The bike won’t sit still for a second.
Every moment is a chance that the bike could disappear from underneath me and send us for a sprawl in the mud.
---
*Hours...*
We've covered twenty odd clicks from the border; that's taken, roughly, three hours.
That's no more than a brisk walking pace...
I’ve got maybe twenty more to go before I get off this track and onto something more “well healed”. *Looking forward to that...*
*Tonk!!!*
That's coming from the bike... 
*Tonk! Tonk! Tonk! Tonk!...*
I can *feel* it.
*Tonk! Tonk!...*
No no no no I've killed it...
*Tonk!...*
It’s definitely not a good sound.
*Tonk!...*
Definitely a bad sound.
*Tonk!...*
Fuck this is going to end badly.
I stop.
The tonking stops when I kill the switch.
I vault off the bike. Give it a good looking over...
*Nothing...*
Besides everything being coated in a thick layer of mud there’s nothing obvious that's out of place; nor is there anything obviously there that *shouldn't* be, like a tree through the wheel spokes...
*What do I do?*
There's no fucking choice, is there?
I start it up again.
*Tonk!*
Still there.
I go.
---
I stop. I look. I start. I go.
I stop. I look. I start. I go.
*I fret...*
It’s worse in first gear. *Louder.*
Which says what??
*I’m not a bloody mechanic...*
It *feels* like it's something inside the engine. Or the gearbox, or whatever.
Do I go faster, or slower?
I can't slow my breathing down.
*I can't lose the bike out here...*
---
I'm ready to snap.
I hit yet another puddle; I nearly drown it again...
Out the other side and the clank has disappeared.
Gone completely.
*"What the fuck!?"*
I don't get it...
---
I spot the first soul I’ve seen out here since the border.
Two souls, in fact. I’ve caught them up. It’s a man and a kid, "two-up" on a plastic Chinese 125cc pile of shit.
The kid on the back is carrying a shitload of bananas. They look like they’ve just cut the branch off a banana tree and are bringing the whole lot back home; all the bananas still attached in groups to the main branch. There must be a hundred bloody bananas on that thing...
Can they really have been doing the same road that I’ve been doing? Two-up with a shitload of bananas?
*How is that even possible?*
The moment that we meet eyes from either side of a massive bog of mud, I'm trying to jump up a small incline.
I beach the exhaust on the mound of mud to the side, and it takes all of the weight off the back wheel and I'm going nowhere. I can’t move, not forwards, backwards or sideways. The back wheel spins uselessly.
Beached.
My banana buddies come over to help me out.
*Lucky as fuck;* I wouldn't have even been a *chance* to get it out without them there.
*Outrageously* lucky, in fact...
What are the odds?
If I wasn’t an atheist I would no doubt be thanking someone upstairs right now...
Even with my new mates, it’s a big effort in the thick mud; it’s a heavy bike, on a steep gradient, and the mud is sucking back every one of our efforts to lift it out of the shit. Not to mention it’s slick enough for our legs sink in but thick enough to hold them in too.
In spite of my boots I can feel the Cameroonian jungle mud sliding between my toes...
It’s a gruelling, exhausting effort to shift the bastard thing - Royal Enfields are fucking *solid* - but we get it done.
My banana buddies ask for 500CFA for their troubles.
*Capitalists.*
That's a touch over $1.
I don’t have any CFA yet, so I give him my Naira instead, which I’m sure he can exchange. I give him 1000 of them, which is about seven bucks.
He makes seven times more than he wanted, I get out of a nightmare.
*Great deal.*
---
We ride on “ensemble”. It's awesome to have a wingman, and I feel more chilled about the prospects for the day already.
Not much further down the way I end up getting beached again.
Again, the banana buddies help me out.
Again, it’s hard work.
I’m *covered* in mud, head to toe, and sweating like no one’s business.
The bike looks amazing though. Absolutely covered in shit. The real deal! Righteous!
There's *never* been a better looking motorcycle than this thing looks right now.
Despite being absolutely fragged, I've got to smile; this is all so wonderfully ridiculous.
---
Finally, *finally* I pop out onto the main road.
We're filthy, but unscathed; well, except my shin...
The main road is tarmac. Crappy, *glorious* tarmac.
There’s a unit of Gendarmes here at the crossroads, and I take the risk of asking them where Customs are, even if it reveals to them that I probably don't have the correct papers...
They point me off up the tarmac main road I probably should have taken to get here; back West in the direction of Nigeria...
*Nope.*
I don't want to re-live the going backwards to a border-post balls-up that happened in Senegal...
Plus, I’m tired, and I’ve no desire to be going in the “wrong” direction; adding clicks onto my already long day.
I just want to lie flat somewhere.
I ask them if there’s any Customs in the village at *Mamfe*, the village I had my eyes on to spend the night.
There is!
The Gendarmes, to their credit, let me go with no questions asked.
After a bit of shitty road the awful clanking tonking sound comes back... I don't need this...
Then I hit beautiful Chinese tarmac.
Flawless, magnificent, Chinese ‘mac.
I could fucking *kiss* it.
Say what you like about the Chinese and their African shenanigans, they make a damn fine road.
---
Checkpoints. Loads of them. I’m always waved through.
The tonking stops.
I hit Mamfe.
Job: *Done.*
Two hundred and twenty one clicks; one border crossing; eight and a half hours.
*I've earned sleep.*

## Chapter Thirty Nine
My bags are full of mud.
Everything’s gonna need a wash.
One of my bags has got a massive tear along its underbelly. Dunno how that happened... I'm lucky it didn't gastro my stuff out all over the road.
Gotta get that fixed.
It’s outrageously hot and humid today.
In fact, I don’t even reckon it’s that hot. Just mad humid.
Jungle humid.
I step out of my room onto the back balcony (yeah, I've got a fuckin balcony). I’ve got a stunning view of the massive *Cross River*. Within seconds I can see small wet, red splotches all down the front of my old pink t-shirt (that used to be red), the dots turn into streaks in minutes. Not much later and it’s *saturated* with sweat.
*Not a good look.*
---
Morning.
I hit the streets.
Despite the never ending stream of "WHITEMAN!" that I cop - and not being able to pin whether the language here is French or English - I still kinda like Mamfe.
I hit-up breakfast. Black beans with rice; The best I reckon I’ve ever had - and I've had my fair share.
Sometimes it’s the little things in life...
While I’m chowing down about 50 cents worth for breakfast, I watch some blokes hauling thick bundles of long, awkward, heavy-as-fuck iron re-bar for concrete support from out of the back of a truck.
Doing the lion’s share of the work is maybe the strongest bloke I reckon I’ve *ever* seen.
You’ve never seen nothing like this guy. Not in your life.
Of middling height, with a bulging pot belly on him that - somehow - is covered in a painted-on looking, *monstrous* six-pack.
*Or is it an eight pack??*
His arms are two lengths of wound bridge steel. *Ripped* as fuck. Or at least some mad combination of being fat and ripped to shreds at the same time.
I don’t get how it works.
He's a human lump of pure, functional strength.
This guy’s never even heard of a gym, yet he’s picking up *bundles* of steel re-bar the way I’d pick up a pile of sticks, walking to the edge of the truck tray, and then just *chucking* it.
It’s awe inspiring.
It looks like he’s been throwing re-bar around since he first started walking.
And here I am, working up a sweat by lifting a spoon of beans to my face.
There’s a lesson to be learned about desk jobs in there somewhere... I’m sure of it...
Anyway, enough of that.
---
After some Marco Polo with the locals I find the Customs building for the village.
The chief bloke is an albino.
Albinos are everywhere here. Surprisingly common, and some more proof to add to the "there is no god" pile.
It's just fucking cruel.
How do they do it?
It’s a very strange thing to behold; pure black features plastered over with pinky white skin, covered in blemishes and freckles from the brutal hard sun here.
Anyway, we've been talking for a while and my new mate is a little confused about what I’m driving at, but he’s happy to oblige me anyway, and tells me that they’ll get someone to bring me an LP from the border, and he can write it up for me tomorrow morning.
*Good stuff.*
---
Back home and over to the bike.
It looks like shit.
I washed it yesterday with some really “hard” water. When I say "hard", I mean the kind of water that you find at the bottom of your kettle - all full of calcified who-knows-what. I then left it out in last night’s rain in the hope that the clean rain would rinse off the calcifications, and some more of the mud.
*Nope.*
Just a lot of rust.
The chain copped it worse than most. It's fucked... I give it a drenching in grease for its trouble.
For reasons of physics that I don’t understand, after getting greased up the chain slackness tightens - *a lot*.
Very odd, but I’ll take it as a win; the chain has been "slapping" with looseness a bit lately, and was due for a tightening. Now I don't have to bother.
I swear, this bike mends itself...
My spidey senses are telling me that this chain’s at the end of its tether... Other than that, I’ve done nothing to fix the “tonking” problem. I’ll just cross my fingers and hope that it mends itself too.
Rain, hail or shine, I have to crack on tomorrow.
Fingers crossed that the weather clears up...

## Chapter Fourty
*It does.*
I wake up to a cool, fresh morning.
There’s a crisp edge to the air, which is like a tonic after the wet, stifling, draining humidity.
Conditions don’t get better than this.
I head to Customs and pick up the LP from my albino buddy with no dramas, and it's off to the next major village down the line, Bamenda.
---
The "N6" is deadset glorious.
Absolutely *immaculate*.
The white, painted-on road markings don’t look like they’ve dried yet; it's that fresh.
After yesterday’s mud bath this was exactly what I needed.
I’ve got it all to myself.
Fuck I love this...
Black underneath, light green on the sides and the "Toy Story" white and blue backdrop overhead.
There are butterflies *everywhere*. In places the sky is *thick* with the colour of them.
It’s friggin gorgeous.
If I was a painter I’d paint this.
The road is alive. It’s moving constantly as we undulate up and down and around the hills and mountains.
The bike is singing to me, music in my ears. I’m singing too. And grinning like a maniac.
I can’t help it.
My spontaneous happiness is mirrored in the spontaneous, easy happiness of the Cameroonians, and as I chug through the small roadside villages there’s always a big white smile and a friendly wave to reflect mine.
This place. Magnificent.
This bike. *Perfect.*
I'm in love.
I'm in fucking *love*.
This is what it’s all about; I’m riding a Royal Enfield through the mountains of Cameroon... *Cameroon!* Who the fuck gets to *do* this shit??
*Outrageous.*
If for nothing else other than this day, this *moment*, it’s *all* been worth it.
---
The dense rain forest starts to give way to a sort of a balding process, and the dark green trees give out to grasslands.
*Have we put on some altitude then?* Must have...
I’m coming out of another friendly small village when I notice three or four women on the side of the road up ahead doing some sort of wild rain dance around an old car wreck.
*This is new...*
They’re flinging their arms around in the air with stick brushes. Dancing about and making a hell of a lot of noise. Wailing away.
A dance of remembrance? *How weird...*
They're dancing in the direction of a car that's on its roof; it's come off the side of the road down a small embankment.
I see someone getting pulled out of one of the smashed windows...
Holy *fuck*!
I feel my face and back fizz with a dump of adrenaline, and steel myself to witness some gnarly shit.
This is fresh. *Very* fresh; I must've missed the crash by *seconds*...
I jump off the bike and run over to the upside down car. There are three old ladies lying on the road. They aren't mangled up like I was expecting, but they also aren't moving about a bunch either.
*I don't want anything to do with this...*
So I run away. Back to the bike.
I have an instinct that there was a hospital back in the village I just passed... A red cross... I *feel* like I saw one. *Maybe...*
I fly back to the village.
---
I was right.
I hit the skids as I slide up to the front doors of the village hospital.
I run through the front doors, *yelling.*
Adrenaline fuelled ranting.
I run up and down the halls yelling at the top of my lungs for help.
Nurses and doctors come out of the woodwork.
I direct them down the road.
The nurses are moving quickly with a sense of purpose.
The doctors want to wait for a bus...
*A bus???*
"It's just up the road! It’s right *there*! You can walk there! People are hurt, could be *dead!!*" I try to create some sense of urgency but the doctors don’t seem to give a shit.
With nothing left to do I jump back on the bike to show the running nurses the way to the wreck.
---
In the time I’ve been away a big mob has formed.
I peer through to where everything’s happening; down the embankment where the wreck is.
Everyone's *fine.* A little shaken up, sure, but they're fine...
*Unbelievable.*
I feel a little sheepish for having panicked - badly. I'm embarrassed for making a fuss...
I hotstep back to the bike and tear out of there.
*What was I supposed to do?* The car was on it's fucking *roof.*
The adrenaline wears off, and my hands stop their tremble.
I quickly forget about it, and go back to enjoying this superb ride.

## Chapter Fourty One
Up in the morning to the best meal I’ve had in a long time, followed by running into a man wheeling a coffee cart.
It’s looking like being my lucky day.
Bamenda’s been ok.
The place is nestled in the bottom of a bowl of mountains. Very pretty, and the air is cool and fresh. It's the first place in months that I haven’t sweated a single drop. It’s a wonderful change.
I couldn't find food last night. Ended up having to eat at a bar... Cold cassava and some cold brown sauce with a sad looking, cold fish.
The fish looked like it'd had a hard life - and an even harder afterlife. Better than nothing, but not by much. I was scared it wouldn't be long till I saw it again - albeit at a higher velocity - but it all worked out ok.
The night was *freezing* cold. My face was eaten my mosquitoes. Fucking malaria *fuckers*...
Anyway.
We're out of town with a full tank of juice.
We climb the switchbacks out of the bowl of mountains, and then climb some more on the other side of that...
We’re off to Kumbo; there's a "ring road" out there that I've been told is worth a look.
The ‘mac’s not anywhere near yesterday’s standards, but that’s ok. It’s not bad at all. Passable, even.
The foggy morning slowly gets baked off by the warmth of the sun, and the grassy green hills are revealed in all their glory.
Kumbo’s not far, so I take it steady and I just soak it all in.
Time seems to be flying by... Go figure.
---
There's no doubting we're at altitude now...
It feels strange; being cold.
It's the kind of cold where your breath fogs... Unbelievable; we're a stone’s throw from the equator, in *Africa*, and my breath is fogging.
Bizarre...
I don't relish the idea of tonight’s shower though...
That ring road around here that I've been told to have a go at looks like it will take a couple of days to go full circle, and given the remoteness I'd probably have to camp out. So I've decided to *can* it; I don't have the spurs to do it by myself. I've had mixed reports on its condition, and I don't relish the idea of being stuck in my tent while I fucking freeze to death.
---
Morning.
Even though it was pretty filthy in my bed, I still didn't want to leave it's smelly warmth...
I boycott the icy shower because I’m a pansy.
*Grubby* is how I'd describe myself.
On the way to breakfast there are a couple of lads sinking beers at one of the shacks. *It’s 8:30 in the morning...*
Righto...
I hit a random restaurant and order breakfast.
It's *epic.*
A huge serving of rice and beans and green sauce with a massive slab of meat - tender as it gets - *and* the top half of what was once a big fish.
*Breakfast of champions.*
Friggin delicious.
At 700CFA it’s a bit exxy for breakfast (that's a touch under a couple of dollars), but the size justifies the spend.
I don't know what it is with me these days but when food is put in front of me I just *inhale* it. I barely chew. I've got no idea why it always feels so *rushed*, almost *panicked*. I eat so fast I make myself feel sick. It's stupid, but I can't stop it for some reason...
---
Today’s plan is to follow the GPS directions a straight shot south via a place called Foumbot to a final destination of Bafoussam, which would take me past a lake, which should be nice.
To double check my plan I ask my hotel host what the best way to go to Bafoussam is.
“First you go Bamenda, *this* way, then from Bamenda you go Bafoussam.”
*What??*
“What?”
“First you go Bamenda, this…”
“Yeah yeah yeah, got it, but what about Foumbot, anyone go that way?”
“No no no. No one goes that way. First, you go Bamenda...”
Shit. That’s a massive detour back to where I've just come from. It must mean that the road straight to Bafoussam is a pile of shit...
It's weird, I feel relieved and pissed off at the same time.
Mostly it's disappointing. I've already copped out of one adventure today, now I'm copping out of another one...
That said, getting into Cameroon was adventure enough, and I'm glad to have done that much at least.
Often, when I'm on the bike, I think of how much of an "adventure" Africa is these days, compared to days gone by, and days to come.
My guess is that Africa will soon be well developed and won’t present the same adventure as it does today.
I wonder though: *have I already missed the boat?*
Is Africa already sanitised and relatively easy compared to the unavoidable adventure that it must have been one or two decades ago?
Of course it must be.
The adventurers of yesteryear would think that my "adventure" is a cakewalk...
But, for my two cents, I reckon that now is a fantastic time to overland Africa; it’s Goldilocks.
One or two decades ago it would have been gnarly as hell - *all* the time. No respite. No fun. No choice.
In another decade - once everywhere's been ‘mac’d by the Chinese - it will be easy as pie.
I think right now you've got adventure when and where you want it. You don't have to go very far to find it. You can be as sedate or as hardcore as you like.
Today, I guess, is going to be that in a nutshell. I’ve got two roads I can take: One known and easy, the other unknown and potentially a nightmare/amazing.
The real question is this: Do I feel like being surprised today?
*No.* Not really.
It's curious how useful a bit of ignorance can be as a seed for adventure. If someone had of shown me photos of the mudbath I was in a few days ago I would have used a different border. No questions asked. If today I hadn't of asked around about how to get to Bafoussam I would have taken the hard road without realising it.
Tough choices, but, at the end of the day, I'm cruising through Cameroon on a Royal Enfield; it's enough.
---
Bafoussam.
I zoomed clean through Bamenda.
The swarms of butterflies, which are like the eighth plague of Egypt, have gone from being pleasurable to being a colourful carnage. I must be killing *hundreds* of them.
Slaughterhouse.
Bafoussam is not a likeable place; it’s a village that's just a little bit too big for itself. Too busy and dirty. No character or colour.
I have another really, *really* shit lunch; It’s a huge plate of rice with a separate plate of a sort of creamy oily sauce with a more cold-than-warm mystery meat. The creamy greasy sauce has danger written all over it.
It's incredible what my gut can put up with these days; not so long ago and shit like this would have blown a hole in my pants in seconds...
Cameroon is odd. This restaurant is a perfect example in miniature: In the one corner talking away in English, and in the other corner they're jabbering away in French. Occasionally they'll throw salvos at one another from across the language barrier; It's clear they don't like one another.
It must be so divisive not to be able to talk to your own countryman. What a mad situation.
Colonialism gone weird.
Back at the hotel with nothing to do, I start thinking about what happens post-Africa. I used to lean heavily towards shipping everything home and being done with it; South America and the world could wait. But now, here, in Cameroon, with Nigeria in the mirrors, it's the opposite; I've swung firmly back into travelling mode.
When I'm not waking up in the morning scared shitless, thinking "holy shit I've got to ride the bike today", I feel like I could keep doing this travelling thing indefinitely.
And you know what? There's a long way to go but I'll be done with Africa pretty promptly; from here on south there's not going to be so much fucking about with bureaucracy at Consulates and Embassies. All of the fiddly little countries of West Africa are behind me; all that's left are the biggens of Central and Southern Africa. *Big* countries. And I don't have any particular reason to stay for a long time in any of them... It should make for some fast travelling;
without the usual distractions I could be at the bottom in three or four months.
I'll be there before I know it...
---
Last night's omelette dinner didn’t *seem* dodgy... And I don’t *feel* crook...
But then why is this my *third* shit for the morning?
*That ain’t normal...*
Maybe it's yesterday's creamy lunch and mystery meats?
Well... Do I stick around here another day to let it settle? It’s tempting... Or do I roll the dice, hit the road, and maybe have one or two (or three?) loose moments in the jungle?
*Fuck it*. Bafoussam is a hole. I want to leave.
I'll trust my gut to handle it. I’ll back it in. Let’s have breakfast and see where that lands...
---
Off to my omelette buddy from last night; in the hustle and bustle of the market.
Again, it’s top notch; deep fried pasta omelette. Fucking delicious. I wash it down with a condensed milk coffee. Good stuff.
Oh. Shit...
"SHIT!!"
I throw money at the chef and I *run.*
Christ no. No no no no.
Agh! No!
Don't run. Walk... Walkwalkwalk.
*I'm going to shit everywhere.*
Jeeesus fucking eff.
I squeeze. Hard. And walk. Slowly...
---
*Whoosh.*
There goes number four...
*I made it.*
I didn't think I would, but I did.
Without being too graphic, I reckon that’s all of it. If it wasn't then I’ll be shitting my organs out next.
I think I can still risk it.
I want out of this shitheap.
*Crack on.*

## Chapter Fourty Two
It's another beautiful ride through the green. The road has switched from crappy to perfect, and my mind free-wheels as it's given its reins.
Humour me; I'm going to talk about what's going on in my head...
Don't worry, it'll be a short chapter (zing).
So. Here's what I think about when I'm riding.
My mate Victor Hugo (I'm chewing through *Les Miserables*) has told me off for thinking that *reverie* and *thinking* are the same things. Apparently they’re not. So I’m going to be more careful to make the distinction. I reckon that what I mostly do on the bike is *think*.
It’s some deep and profound shit.
All day I’m coming up with gems. Pearls of wisdom; left, right and centre.
I'd love to tell you what they are. Fuck, *I'd* love to know what they are; yet the moment, the *instant,* that I get off the bike is like the moment I wake up from a dream, and what was so vivid and clear just a moment ago is now a vague shadow, or nothing at all. It just fucking *evaporates.* Even as I clutch at it.
I think so much on that bike; *way* more than any other time of the day.
I reckon that it’s my muse. So I’ve decided to name it *“The Shrike”*.
I’ve pulled the name from a sci-fi novel I’ve just finished reading called *Hyperion*. The Shrike is an epic, singular creature made out of metal spikes. It kills people for fun...
It doesn’t *seem* apt as a name, *sure*, but I like it because it was the muse of one of the main characters in the book, and my Shrike is my metal muse; the inspiration for all of my best thoughts.
I’m also not sure that it's apt, as the main character was - spoiler alert - killed (and brutally) by the Shrike in the book, but let’s not get too into the details...
I just like it.
Voilà; I told you it would be a short chapter.
Today it's been a little hard to think; butterflies exploding in your eyes at 80 clicks can bump you out of your train of thought.
The poor demented fuckers then get wedged somewhere in my helmet around my ears, and flap and squirm frantically like a fish out of water in their death throes. All of this happening *on* my face. I’ve gotta pull over, all the time, to get the bloody things out.
I get stopped for the first time at a checkpoint. They're pretty toothless - despite wanting to see *everything*. They even accept my shitty, laminated photocopy of my drivers license.
There’s the occasional eucalyptus tree lining the road. I didn’t know that they had those here. It makes me homesick.
But hey, at least I haven't shat my pants yet.
The sky is a gorgeous blue with fluffy white cumulus floating about, taking up about half the sky. Again, perfect riding conditions. Cameroon is just green, green, green and more green. It's so monotonous that when you pass a rare, red, flowering tree in bright full bloom it really hooks your eyes and leaves an impression.
It tickles me when people are a couple of hundred metres up the road from me and they turn to look at where all the noise is coming from.
The Shrike at 80 clicks heading uphill makes a hell of a racket!
Fuckin *righteous!*
I’ve noticed that I fantasise a lot less about my desk job back home. It seems to get further and further away all the time...
I work and I work and I hoard up all that money; and for what?
To what *end?*
I reckon that the next time around I’ll work just as much as I need to make the ends meet, and then get to the ends themselves. The "Why".
Do things.
Learn shit.
I've been having daydreams about surfing in the morning, in to work at ten, out at two, then heading to a class for language or music or going for a run or learning how to be a pilot or something like that. Different shit. A modern day fucking renaissance man.
I've also had fantasies about not working at a desk job anymore, and being a labourer instead. The dream is to lift things. That’s all. Do an honest day’s work.
I think the way I want to structure my life when I get back home is of physical and mental exhaustion, *every day*. Have the eyes roll into the back of my head even before it hits the pillow.
That's what brings happiness and contentment, I reckon.
An honest day's work and an honest day's learning.
I think that before the trip I had the physical side down-pat. Logging big miles into my running shoes every day was making me sleep like a baby at night. But I neglected the mental side almost completely; in the four years I worked at the desk I don't think that I learned hardly any new practical skills or absorbed any real practical knowledge about *anything*.
I ceased to be a student.
I settled in to knowing what I needed to know in order to do my job, and no more.
Not through lack of opportunity, but rather through a lack of gumption. Lack of curiosity. I didn’t give a shit for it. I tried - half-arsed - with music. I put too much faith in osmosis - the idea that if I put myself in the right environment, that I'll just "pick it up"; if I soak myself in something that it will sink in eventually.
I've tried it with music, I've tried it with language.
Osmosis doesn't do *shit*.
Well, at least *I* don't work like that. *At all.*
We all need teachers; they give us direction and structure.
When I return home, I want to have many different teachers for many different skills. As many as I can get my hands on.
I want to be a jack of every trade.
Learning awaits. It's exciting. I know I have the aptitude for anything I set myself to.
My problem is discipline...
"90% of success is showing up." Don't remember who said that, but it's true.
*I need to keep showing up.*

## Chapter Fourty Three
*Yaounde.*
And I didn’t shit my pants. *Not once.*
I waste no time and head straight to the Republic of Congo Consulate on the bike. "Visa hours" are over for the day, but they let me in to ask questions.
All seems normal; they want an invitation letter or a hotel booking - which I've forged already. But the annoying bit is that they say it will take one week to issue. One *week*... And it's only a fifteen day visa.
For seventy-ish bucks.
That’s a bloody long time to wait for a very short, very expensive visa...
I *can* get an "express" visa. That'll cost double, and take three days to issue...
Express??!! *Express my arse!*
I hate this shit.
I'm tempted to roll the dice and hope I can pick it up in Gabon for cheaper...
In any case, they can't kick things off today as they're closing up shop, so I jump on the bike and take off.
On the way out I ride past a bloke wearing a suit, which is odd; he’s casually taking a piss into the gutter on the side of the road...
*As you do...*
---
I shack up at a place run by some church organisation at the top of a hill overlooking Yaounde in another bowl of mountains.
It’s a tranquil, secluded spot with a big paddock of turf out the back with a big tree and a swing plonked in the middle. I can already see myself in the picture reading a book.
My bed looks like it came out of the hospital barracks of a bad world war one movie. The fact it's a dorm doesn't help the image...
But, that said, the rest of the place has a homey, cottagey feel to it. Which is a really nice break from the monotony of cheap hotels.
It's a big two storied house that's got an aged feeling to it that isn't unpleasant. It smells old. Like old wood. The place is run by an old man from Switzerland named Jana. He's got a massive wound on his head. Looks pretty friggin gnarly. I don't ask him about it. There are two old women here, two young blokes and one little girl.
I’m the only visitor. Just me.
Despite this, I'm a bit worried about not being able to lock up my shit anywhere, and The Shrike is just floating around out the front, but I'm here now and there's nothing for it.
Three days of lazing about, coming right up; I'll work hard to shorten that by pouring on the charm at the Congo embassy, but I think it will fall on deaf ears.
---
I head into town to connect with the rest of the planet.
Back home, and Mum's freaking out. Like, freaking *right* the fuck out.
I reckon she’s had a proper meltdown. Beside herself. Hysterical.
Lunatic.
*Poor Dad.*
In the last message she’s saying that she can't handle it and I need to leave Africa. Lots of ALL CAPS and exclamations and demands. And that’s unfair; I’m pretty safe here in Cameroon. Fair enough to be a bit shirty about Nigeria - that’s only natural - but that’s all in the mirrors now.
Usually I ignore these messages, but this one seemed to snap something in me; and I tee off.
It's harsh and blunt, basically saying "build a bridge", because I'm not dropping everything and coming home. I’m here. I'm not leaving. *Get over it.*
I'm a grown man, for fuck's sake. At what age do you stop listening to your parents?? *This* many years old.
I hit send. An instant later I realise how much of a piece of shit I am. I send an immediate apology.
The whole thing goes down like a lead balloon.

## Chapter Fourty Four
Today, I start the day with a smile.
I’m up early and away to the Congo Embassy.
The embassy is one of those places where the people look like they've never smiled in their lives; a sad, passive-aggressive bunch. What is it about people in diplomatic posts with no jam in their doughnuts?
The security guard at the gate has cogged me from yesterday afternoon, and kicks things off on the wrong foot by asking me for my motorcycle papers.
"Why?"
He doesn't give a good reason.
Something like: "Because."
I hate it when people ask for stuff that is none of their business; here's looking at you, Mr Nigeria-Border-Wanker.
I cough up the papers, which are in English, and the douche looks thoughtfully at the page that's dedicated to vehicle registration transfer applications...
*Tit.*
I get past him into the embassy proper, and write up my application form on a comfy leather couch in front of a couple of desks of the worker bees.
They want copies of everything.
And I mean *everything*. They even want photocopies of the blank pages of my passport... and the irrelevant sheets of my motorbike rego.
*Whatever Trevor.*
I give them a copy of my passport's "photo page" for a start. It's only half a sheet of paper - torn in half - so I could fit more than one copy on the page.
Not good enough... One of the worker bees doesn’t like the tear in the paper.
*Nit pickers.*
I cheekily reach for the scissors to even up the cut. He doesn't like that.
Not. One. Bit...
He starts getting *really* demanding; it’s obvious from the look on his face that he’s trying his best to be as difficult as he possibly can. I can tell he's looking for a fight; dying for a fight.
All he gets in reply are big smiles and a lot of thumbs up and “pas de problem”; I don't want to give him a shred of satisfaction.
I head off to find a photocopier shop...
---
I've got *tonnes* of paper. Enough to choke on. A thick fuckin stack of it.
I head back and place the pile on the desk. Big smiles. Are we happy now, arsehole?
*Nope.*
I think he’s cogged that me coming across all sycophantic is a bit of a joke on him.
I don’t think he likes me much... He decides that he can’t give me a LP for the bike.
Piece of *shit*.
Whatever. Who cares? This is my Tuesday.
They *can* issue the visa which is good news, even though it's the worst value visa in Africa. But I can't pay here, I have to head to a bank that’s halfway across town, make a cash deposit, and then bring back a stamped money slip.
This just keeps *dragging*...
But what other choice do I have?
---
I walk. I get to see Yaounde. And to think...
Yaounde ain’t ugly. The city sits in a sort of crater made by the mountains. The hills are green and the occasional low hanging cumulus cloud floats under the peaks, into our bowl.
I think of this trip, and how I feel about it at the moment. I reckon I'm treating it trip in just the same way as I treat a marathon.
It feels just like that.
For the first half I'm "in the moment", I'm carrying out the planned pace and getting done what I've got to get done.
Workman-like.
But, as always happens in a race, right at the halfway point - which is essentially now - I want to accelerate. I start to want to just have it over and done with. I fall into the trap of thinking that there's “not long to go”, and I think more and more of the finish line.
I've done something like seven thousand clicks since Dakar and I've still got roughly the same distance again to go - and that's if I *“go to Cape Town, go directly to Cape Town, do not pass go, do not collect $200”*. It's still a massive distance to cover. Uncountable hours in the saddle.
I can't think that I'll be able to get this done *"just like that"*. Angola and Namibia are *huge* countries. I keep on thinking that it's right there, *so close*, and in my mind I calculate how many day's it will take to get there if I "nail it".
In the marathon - with this mindset - I burn out; I’ve done that twice before. I "take off" at the half way point, full of enthusiasm. "This is a piece of cake, time to *really* run." In ten clicks I fry myself out completely - a physical and mental quaking mess with only three quarters behind me. The final ten is *hell*.
I need to learn from it. Stop making the same mistakes. Slow things down.
Lots of my thoughts these days are revolving around things that I have little or no control over. It's silly and achieves nothing. Like Angola, and just how the hell I’m going to get a ticket into the place. I've two chances to get the visa, the first is Libreville in Gabon and the second is Brazzaville in Congo. I don't want to go to Brazzaville – I’ve heard it’s a nightmare – so that puts a lot of pressure on Libreville. If they simply say *no* in Libreville – and it can be as easy as that - "no" - then I’ll be forced to go to Brazzaville. And if they say "no" in Brazzaville then my options become really, *really* poor. Option One is to backtrack to get the visa... to *Togo*. I already know that I'm not going to do that; go back through Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria and Benin?
*Fuck that.*
Option Two is to go from Brazzaville to Zambia via the "other Congo", *the bad Congo*, The *Democratic Republic* of Congo. The old *"Zaire"* And that means taking "the death road", or is it "the hell road"? It's not good, whatever it is... A few thousand kilometres in outback *DRC* on a road with a horrendous reputation for being almost impassable most of the time.
I think I would do it... but to do it solo?
No.
It’d kill me. But, at the same time, I don’t see people queuing up to do it with me. I could maybe wait for *JB the Brit* to catch up...
Option Three is to ship my way out of trouble. I don't think I could do that.
I know that doing Africa, top to bottom, is arbitrary and meaningless - but what an arbitrary and meaningless achievement! I wouldn't ship.
So, what I've got are three options, none of which is *really* an option.
What that means is that I've got to make the Angolan visa stick in Gabon.
Come hell or high water.
But, again, that's something that I have very limited control over.
So, I think what I'm getting at here, is that I need to be armed to the teeth for any possibilities at the Angolan Embassy in Libreville. And that means going armed with a residency permit, a letter of invitation, a hotel booking, two references, the whole nine yards. There really is too much at stake to be happy-go-lucky for that one; I'm fucked if it doesn't work out. I think, if it did come to an Angola fail at the embassy, I would try to get a visa extension for Gabon and kill time there while I wait for JB to catch up, and we’d do the death road together... 
Maybe...
---
I toss the bank statement in the face of the unhappy arsehole.
Another thing I've been getting shitty about for nothing is the Congo visa. No use working yourself up over it. It is what it is; be happy to wait in a peaceful place for it. What's the rush?
---
Rain day.
Tasks for today include snoozing like I’m getting paid for it, eating, and reading.
Tough gig.
Task one goes till something like 9am, eventually waking up to the sounds of rain on the tin roof and bird birds going berserk through the open window.
As good a way to wake up as I can think of. Well, alone, that is, of course...
Well, that's depressing...
Bean and egg sandwich from just down the road, and that’s task two done.
I’m on fire today.
I grab a "3 in 1" Nescafe coffee sachet. I don't know what the three are...
I spend all of what’s left of the day reading *Les Miserables.*
All that time reading - almost non-stop - and I only get make five percent progress, according to the e-reader.
This book is a beast.
If you haven't read it yet, you should.
If you've never been in love before you could skip to where Marius meets Cosette and then you'll know what it's like. If you think you've been in love you should probably read this part anyway just to check that you're doing it right...
For lunch I had maybe the tastiest sauce I've had in ages. Delicious greasy green cassava sauce served with something that was like a fufu but much tastier, served in a shape resembling... Hmmm I don't know what. A fat cylinder. Hold your snickering... Be mature. Anyway, a really, really good and simple lunch.
Dinner is an omelette in bread from a man with a rolling kitchen.
And that’s another day in the books.
Tick.
---
I'm still thinking of the finish line.
*I can’t help it.*
I'm doing the math incessantly; distances, ride times, breaks for getting visas, border days.
Trying to plan the un-plannable.
I'm even thinking about whether I can go via the eastern countries; it'd be a detour, but what a great detour! Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique... Fuck yes.
It's fruitless, really, to be thinking of this any sooner than the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is where I’ll find that fork in the road.
And that's still a long, long way off.
It's a crapshoot; the only thing that you can be *really* sure of is that what you’ve planned definitely won’t be what happens.
I've got to keep reminding myself that there will come a time, one day, when I'll wish I could come back to this time of freedom and discovery. The fact that all I want is to rush it and have it over and done doesn't give any respect to that...
Live in the moment.
It's just like a day's ride on The Shrike; when my head is buried in the GPS, always wondering how long to go, it seems to take forever. But when I enjoy the ride and soak up the surrounds - and don't look at the GPS - the time flies and it's *far* more enjoyable.
*A watched kettle never boils."
---
The next morning is another wipe.
I've got nothing better to do, so I head to the Congo Embassy to see how things are going.
The moment I arrive the worker bees jump all over me.
They’ve been trying to call me for *days*. There’s a problem with my application.
*Shit*.
I really should get a phone number. It’s times like this that faking a local number on forms bites me in the arse.
The problem with my application, I’m told, is that my hotel confirmation letter (which I forged...) has a duration (a month) that is longer than the period of the visa (only 15 days).
It's just as well that they've pulled me up on it; I had the vague feeling when I walked out of the embassy a few days back that I'd (and this is unrelated...) fucked up my visa's starting date on the form; a niggling feeling that I’d put a "six" on the month of entry instead of a "five". June, instead of May; which, indeed, I did.
This would have meant that - had my application been successful - my visa would have started a month after I wanted it to, which would have been long after my Gabon visa expires. There would have been a two week black hole with no valid visa for either country...
Thank fuck I stuffed up the hotel stay.
“Je venir tres vite!” which is french for “I come very fast!” Doesn’t translate well, granted, but that's how you say "I'll be right back."
I run to the closest "cyber" to re-forge a new email with the dates tidied up to match the visa I want.
It's weird, because, for authenticity, the second fake email confirmation has be a reply to me asking for them to change my dates because I've made a mistake... “Oh, really sorry, I’ve mixed up my dates, can you change them for me?” and then a reply from them back, waxing lyrical with fancy words but essentially saying nothing more than “yeah sure, no worries”.
It’s a paper trail of forged garbage, complete with correct timestamp data and signatures.
It’s got to look legit.
It’s more lying than I feel comfortable with...
The whole job takes twenty minutes.
I quickstep back to the embassy and hand them the “new” emails.
No one at the embassy even bats an eyelid.
I thought I was being pretty blatant - and was gonna get called out for it - but they either don’t know, or they do know and they don’t care. I can't tell which.
They would be within their rights to cancel the application and ask me to re-apply - and pay again - or they could say that it's going to be another three day wait.
Instead, I had my passport back in my hot hands - with a visa - within fifteen minutes.
You ripper. Gotta be happy with that result.
Next stop, *Gabon*. Right on the Equator. Tropical, no doubt...
*There will be mud...*

## Chapter Fourty Five
Ebolowa.
The ride was a bit of a blur. A blur of green. So much bloody green. Good tarmac. It all just rolled easily by.
It's amazing how quickly my brain can assimilate and normalise natural beauty. I'm completely desensitized to it already.
Surrounded by the stunning - and yet not paying attention to any of it.
Just a few days ago this would have had me gawking out of my helmet, now it's just "par for the course".
Doesn’t matter how good things get, us humans have a knack for making the amazing the new benchmark, and then we go looking for something better... Never happy.
I was spat on by the odd bit of rain. I was expecting to get soaked. Very lucky, though I'm not sure how long that's going to last.
There's nothing wrong with Ebolowa. Nice enough middling village with enough action to keep me happy.
I ask around at the more obvious expensive hotels for where the budget options are, and they point me in the right direction.
At the budget hotel, the boss shows me around my potential room.
The toilet has a big nugget of shit hanging on to the side of the toilet bowl. And when I say a big nug, I mean *big*. It's breaking the laws of physics, a real cliff hanger.
It’s that kind of place...
I get a *different* room. Despite the nug, the boss wants eight grand for the night. He haggles like a fiend... I manage to punch him down to five thousand, but it's like I'm pulling teeth.
It’s actually pretty decent accommodation.
Clean.
Having my own bathroom is something of a luxury.
After skipping lunch today (again...) I'm deadset *Lee Marvin*, so I head out to grab grub. Ebolowa is Goldilocks; big enough for hotels, small enough for everything to be packed into one epicentre.
I quickly find some green ‘n’ greasy cassava sauce that came with big fat curls of mystery animal skin. Imagine the curls of pork crackling, but instead of being fried or baked or whatever it’s been boiled. So it’s *not* nice and crunchy, but soft and chewy.
*Super* chewy.
It's not pleasant texturally - at all - but still tastes pretty good, like chewing the fat on a steak. That said, I’m very, *very* conscious of the fact that I’m eating an animal right now... Where the hair’s been ripped out of the skin it's all prickly, like the animal had goosebumps when they lopped its head off and it stayed that way.
Mmmm. *Yum.*
I sit at the bar where they were serving up the grub for a couple of hours and just watch the world go by. Just looking dead into space. Car and people rolling by.
Might have been the effect of not eating then filling the stomach. I don't want to move a muscle...
With the sun setting I chase down an omelette cart man - with his hot-dog stand style setup.
Dessert is a bunch of bananas and a few oranges that have been peeled for me - which is a wildly popular thing here in Africa.
I really, really, *really* want to like Cameroon.
I've been looking hard for things to blow me away and compel me to put it at the top of my "favourite places" list. But if I'm honest, it's just not there.
For a great country you don't have to *look* for the amazing, it will find you. And sure, Cameroon has been excellent, travelling has been easy, the landscapes have been nothing but green, the weather has - surprisingly - turned it on, the people are super friendly - it's got everything in spades - but it's missing some sort of "X factor". It just doesn't have *it*.
---
The border day starts out chilly and foggy.
I’m cold in my jacket again on the ride to the post.
I say my goodbyes to the decent tarmac and steel myself for a heavy day in the saddle.
The cloud eventually clears to leave beautiful blue skies and fluffy cumulus with the sun smashing down on my head to get things baking.
I make the border and check out of Cameroon with no dramas. After the Douane checks my passport (not sure why he’d do that) the guy say’s that he’s thirsty, which means I should give him a little something for a drink.
I don’t even blink. I go to the saddlebags and grab him a plastic sack of water. Cost me 5 cents.
I’m a genius. Hilarious.
I’m promising myself that I can laugh at this later. For now it’s straight faces.
He’s not happy with it.
"What? You said you were thirsty?"
"No not this, I want a beer."
"That's too bad..."
He's already nibbled on a corner of the water bag, now he tries to give it back to me... "Nah mate, it’s yours now."
I roll on to the Police post. 
In the shack I introduce myself around. One of the assistants, a huge fat lad, jumps all over me.
His name is Raoul, and he wants so badly to be an American.
This bloke’s watched *way* too many movies. The thickness of the Yankee accent he’s putting on is outrageous. Totally over the top.
He's in his element, and he’s hamming it up for me as best he can for his mates.
Despite the ridiculous accent his English is solid, and it’s a nice change to find myself on the other side of the fence - where I’m privy to a conversation and everyone else is in the dark. Like we're speaking a private language.
A girl walks into the post to get her passport stamped, and Raoul loses it.
She cops a roasting.
"Oh my god those eyes - *unbelievable*. And check out that huge *ass*! *Incredible*!"
All while she’s right there and oblivious. And, yes indeed, she’s a looker... I’m sitting in the corner grinning my head off.
The cops are still getting my details down when another bloke walks into the post. It’s pretty obvious, even to me, that he’s without papers, and he’s having a crack at bribing his way across the border. I see 10,000 CFA getting thrown around. A bit more than twenty bucks.
But the cops aren’t going for it.
The bloke gets a hard no and he goes wild. Cracks shits, bigtime.
*This is gonna come to blows...* He’s yelling at the cops, *right in their faces.*
They frogmarch him out of the tent.
As he storms off, Raoul is in his element, taunting this poor bloke no end in French. The cops are loving it. Pissing themselves laughing. And I’m laughing too, even though I don't cog a word of it.
So long, Cameroon, it’s been a blast.
---
Gabon!
We cross a gorgeous little (bridged) river and arrive at the post. The blokes there inspect my passport, write my details down on a piece of paper and tell me to go “vant-nerf kilomet”, that’s 29 kilometres, up the road to get my passport stamped.
Odd. Never had to do that before.
I go a few clicks up the road and there’s a Douane checkpoint.
Nope, no dice there either.
Why the fuck bother with a checkpoint then? Why have any border control at all?
They tell me to get a laissez-passer in *Bitam*, which turned out to be the 29km up the road.
Off I go.
And straightaway I’m shocked. Wonderfully shocked; the roads are good.
*Real* good.
So much for a mud pit...
---
In Bitam I take on the Douanes, first.
There's no need to be worried, because it's not a roped setup, which means that they can't keep me hemmed in if I get refused.
And yet...
The heart won't pay attention to rational thought; I can feel it beating heavily in my chest.
I go through the bottom few layers of plebs and end up having to sit about for longer than I’d like to in a waiting room.
Just stewing.
Eventually the chief will see me. Her name is Elizabeth.
Go Gabon.
I apologise for my French, in French, as always.
It's a ploy. It always gets a smile and a small chuckle - so I'm sure it must sound like shit - but for some reason it makes everyone try to help me out. Like I’m some sort of endearing, well-meaning moron in need of some assistance.
"Pardon pour m'Francais, cest pa bon, je'dua appran plu Fraincais". Doesn’t crack it with Liz... she flies on in machine gun, rapid-fire-French.
Whatever.
She wants to see my Carnet.
That old chestnut...
I roll out my usual spiel. It's well practised by now... Showing off all the places I've been and all that.
She tells me that it's impossible to issue a "passavant", which I think is an LP... that starts at one end of the country and ends at the other.
I pull out my Cameroon LP "Voila... Pa de problem".
Most of the time I'm actually quiet, letting them convince themselves.
Give someone enough rope...
After a long grind it eventually works; she wants to help me out.
She issues me a "passavant", even though I reckon they’re breaking some of their own rules to do it.
I've no idea about the technicalities of a passavant, but so long as it has a stamp on it I can wave it in the face of anyone who tries to stop me; and that's enough.
Apparently it's going to take them a while, so I head to Immigration.
It's a shack that looks like it should be selling food...
They want two photocopies of my passport, which is normally not required. I reckon Immigration’s in cahoots with the photocopying mob across the road. Seems a nice little cottage industry they’ve got going, and it doesn’t help that photocopies are four times the normal price.
I’ve only got just under three blank pages left in the passport; two clean blank pages and one page with the Mauritania and Ghana stamps on it. The rest are all packed with stickers and ink.
The blank pages are really starting to come in at a premium; I don't want to run out of space and have to order a new passport just to get through these next few countries.
The bloke at Immigration wants some money to stamp it where I wanted him to; right in amongst a sea of other ink all crowded in on top of each other. I pretend I don’t understand French very well. He gives in and stamps it - correctly - and tosses it back to me.
*I'm in.*
I head back to the Douanes and there's a gorgeous passavant there for me. Lovely. They don't ask for any money either. Fucking bonus.
Job done. Before I peel out of Bitam I stop at a restaurant with people eating what looks like some pretty basic food. I ask the boss "combi-yan de la mem shose" - *how much for the same thing*, pointing to one of the other guys who's eating what looks like rice and cassava. 1500cfa. Wowsers. A dish like that usually maxes out at 500cfa, and that's for a shedload, that’s like all you can eat. I make exclamations but she's sticking to her guns. No wriggle room.
Bugger that.
I go next door and have a chocopan with bread, which is Africa’s answer to Nutella, for 400cfa, which, again, is pretty outrageous.
I’m starting to smell a trend...
Anyway. We’re out of here.
---
Superb.
Fucking superb.
It's twice as good because I was expecting no road at all.
Perfect tarmac with constant corners and ups and downs like a beautiful gentle roller-coaster.
It's so nice to have rock bottom expectations and have them be thoroughly, delightfully, exceeded.
This place is possibly even greener than Cameroon.
The trees are hugging a bit closer to the side of the road and the subtle effect is noticeable. The trees shadows over the road, sometimes canopying over the route.
Wonderful. Fucking gorgeous.
We hit a joint called Oyem at about three in the afternoon. It's a confused village, with no real heart, no epicentre.
The first hotel I stop in at looks pretty standard to me, but they want 10,000 CFA. Twenty bucks.
When I explain to them that I’m more in the region of four grand, they take me to a room that's a pile of shit. Just a dirty, dirty bed.
8000 CFA.
Ah, no. No thanks.
I ride all over town, stopping at six other places I find. They're either shithouse and cheap or they're shithouse and expensive. All are “in the middle of nowhere” locations.
I'm getting tired and headachy from ripping off and squeezing on my helmet fourteen times. My ears are about to get completely ripped off...
I go back to my first option and take a 10,000cfa room for eight grand. I can certainly live with that, but it's very poor value.
I get settled and go grab some water. 100cfa for a sachet; double Cameroon and quadruple the rest of Africa.
I'm still not sure if I’m being had, or if Gabon is just plain expensive, but yeah, the correlation is getting stronger with every purchase.
Dinner’s a simple bowl of rice with mystery meats for 1000cfa, two bucks, *double* what it should be.
Gabon's gonna cost me!
---
There's a shower.
A *hot* shower.
Hot tip: If you really, really want to enjoy something, like, “the divine vision” sort of level of enjoyment, just abstain from whatever it is for as long as you can.
And then have it...
Despite the very dark, very dingy bathroom, this is still something special.
It's been forever.
It's like nirvana...
Sweet baby Cheeses!
In your life, you’ve never had a shower like this...
Well, sure you have; you probably have one every day. Maybe two. Maybe three if you’re OCD. But a shower like *this*. No. Never. Not in your life.
I can feel every drop.
A hot shower is an absolute riot of the senses. A total overload. There’s nothing that’s even remotely like it.
We’re all just desensitised to it.
The opulent and wonderful has become the mundane and routine.
This shower might be the single greatest physical feeling I’ve ever had. *Ever*.
I slid off this planet somewhere into the realm of the purely physical. Pure experience. Pure feeling.
I’m only vaguely aware that far off back in the real world I’m making involuntary noises.
After what has probably been much too long an amount of time - or maybe it was only seconds? - I snap back into myself like a click of the fingers, come back to my brain, and realise where I am. It's a shower, again.
---
Today's gonna be a gorilla.
Almost four hundred clicks worth of riding, and then into a busy capital: *Libreville.*
I’m already kicking myself for having slept through till eight in the morning. I reckon that’s gonna be a mistake...
By my numbers it’s going to be something like seven hours of non-stop riding. Ideally I’d break that sort of distance down into two days, but as far as I can tell on the maps there’s nothing going on between here and Libreville.
Even though I’m already behind the eight ball, there’s nothing that can stop me from having another shower.
---
The Shrike gets a brimful of juice at the local "Oil Libya" (yeah, that’s totally a thing...) and we’re off.
Only a small way out of the village and I come across a street sign that stops me in my tracks. Libreville: 525km
*Whatthefuck??*
That’s not right...
My planned route was going to take me on the “A5”, but this sign, I guess, is telling me to go a different way...
The A5, on the maps, looks like it skims the border with a neighbouring country – a country that I’m skipping myself – called "Equatorial Guinea" which is a small country, and, apparently, notoriously unwelcoming to foreigners. I’ve no qualms in skipping it. Anywho, the A5 - depending on which map you believe - either comes super-duper close to the border, or very briefly, crosses the border - dipping into Equatorial Guinea - and then crosses right back. Which would be totally pointless and stupid. But there you go.
I ride on. What else am I going to do?
---
At the turnoff for the A5 there’s another street sign with "Frontier Guinea Eq." written on it. The arrow points off the tarmac and onto a red dirt track that’s gone a deep red-brown with the rain, disappearing off into the thick jungle of trees...
Nope.
Nup.
No.
Too many things can go wrong.
What happens if I get a hundred odd clicks up the road, after hours in the saddle, in the middle of nowhere, only to find a border control post douchebag who gives me a flat "Nope, sorry…"?
What then?
There’s also a chance that Mother Nature might say "No. I’ve fucked the road for you with rain, sorry".
Even if that was ok, after a late start I don't reckon I can handle 300km of who-knows-what condition dirt track.
Really, there’s no option at all.
Tarmac all the way.
I take off down the blacktop, feeling a little gutless.
I miss having JB the Brit around.
If he were here, it would have been a no-brainer as well... "Yes! Dirt!! About fucking time, I’m sick of this boring blacktop!"
I would have gone along with it.
Interesting, how one person can change everything. Solo it’s inconceivable, tandem it’s inconceivable *not* to. It would have been one hell of a day to go that way.
As a solo biker it’s screaming out “death by misadventure”. If anything goes balls up you're alone in the middle of nowhere. What if I come off and snap my leg. What then? I'd be in a deep load of fucked. That’s what.
I’m not too crushed about the detour. So it goes... It make’s everything go from feeling mostly unknown to probably ok; but the trouble is that it's taken a monster of a day and turned it into a PB ride. I have to break some of my iron-butt records...
Too bad. Suck it up. Get it done.
---
Six hours in, and what can I say?
This is, maybe, as good as it gets. And if it ain’t, then it’s surely fucking close.
From shower nirvana to biking paradise.
Six hour’s worth of stunning nature and perfect, perfect road. A better ride I couldn’t design: The tarmac rides fast, with curves smooth and long enough that you can do it any speed, any gear you wish, but it keeps a tightness that gets you laying the bike right over every single corner.
It feels like a river, ribboning and snaking back onto itself over and over and over and over.
Unlike a river, the road rises and falls as well.
It never rests, never stops.
It’s a never ending dance in three dimensions in a sea of green.
Hundreds of kilometres of ever-changing racetrack.
And it's all mine.
The only hint of traffic is the occasional truck that's rolled over into the jungle from taking a corner too quick. The trucks here are even equipped with welded on roll-cages...
The surrounds are beautiful, monotonously so. A constant deep, thick green of huge trees that come right up to the side of the road.
Thick! Packed with life.
This is as good as nature gets.
In many places the road makers have had to cut a swathe sheer into the mountainside to make the road possible. The massive, ancient trees sitting impossibly on the precipice at the top make me feel like a child again; the whole world towering all around me.
The beauty is so all encompassing, the monotony so complete, that I quickly desensitise again and stop paying attention.
Every now and again I snap out of a daydream to have my breath taken away by something suddenly revealed out of the living green walls; like, cresting the top of a hill with a moment's clear view of the immensity of the rain forest sprawled out beneath. It goes on forever. A carpet of green.
Green green green green green.
In six hours I’ve barely stopped riding at all.
I’m starting to feel a little giddy.
I haven't been taking care of myself, and I know it.
No lunch.
It’s proper hot and reeking humid, and I haven't been drinking enough water; only half a litre since this morning... Which, in these conditions - with a leather jacket, kevlar jeans and a black helmet, mind you - is clearly not enough.
I snap out of my giddiness when I see a sign:
VOUS FRANCHISSEZ L'EQUATEUR.
I’m not sure whether to celebrate... The word “franchissez” has thrown me a bit; I've no idea what it means.
"Cross", or "approach"?
The sign's giving nothing away - it's just a crappy road sign. None of the fanfare that should accompany something as big as the crossing of the equator...
I get off the bike to take a happy snap, just in case. I get swamped by those little black eye-loving wasps. The air is so thick with the annoying, persistent little fuckers that I can’t get a clear shot of the sign without one of them ending up as a black blur on the picture, or jumping into the corner of my eye and digging its way under.
They're driving me fucking nuts.
They’re obviously not out on the road, otherwise I’d have a few hundred thousand of the bastards sprayed over the front of my visor by now... No. They're smarter than that. They must lie in wait for a victim...
Trick to keeping them out of your eyes is to keep walking all the time. I lead on a cloud of them behind me like the pied piper.
I get my shots, and ride on.
No other signs. I guess that was it then...
I'm into the southern hemisphere, which happens to be my favourite hemisphere.
---
A short ride after the equator the road turns to shit.
It’s evident that they plan to re-lay it – with all the machinery and foundation laid down and ready to go.
The shitty road follows the banks of a massive river. It'd take a sprinter about twentyish seconds to run from one bank to the other, I reckon. That is, if the sprinter was Jesus...
So yeah, big river. What’s more impressive is how fast the water is moving for such a huge river. Moving faster than I jog. That thing must be shifting a shit tonne of water.
I worry about a puncture. The rocks on this to-be road are sharp...
That's the least of my troubles; at this rate I'm fuck all chance of making Libreville by dark...
---
The road transforms back into flawless, brand spanking new tarmac; they haven’t even had the time to put the white lines on it...
I think that was half an hour of rough stuff. Maybe?
I’m really starting to feel myself bugging out now.
My head isn't keeping pace with the bike.
Brain not working.
I don’t know what time it is, but it’s far enough past a skipped lunch to be in some trouble...
It's stupid, and I know it.
I'm wigging out, and I'm still passing villages with perfectly good places to take a break...
The drive to cover as much mileage as possible is near *manic*. Utterly single minded. And it's to my detriment; I won’t stop to take a quick break, I won’t stop to look at something, or turn around the bike to take a photo of a funny street sign, like a village called "Plus-Tard".
I will *not* smell the roses.
The only thing I stop for is to piss, and, given I'm not drinking anything, it's a rare occurrence.
But I'm not hungry, not thirsty, not hot, not tired, not anything.
---
It comes to a head; my arms and my head feel like they're full of lead. I feel on the edge of blacking out.
My desperation to get to Libreville is finally outweighed by being terrified about passing out on the move. From manic for Libreville to manic for water.
I finally pull in at a dingy looking street-side restaurant, and it's only once I've come to a complete stop that I realise just how humid it is.
*Off the scale.*
In the absence of the airflow created by The Shrike I’ve got sweat marks forming all across the front of my shirt in seconds.
I should have known. The only place that hasn't had any airflow has been sweating profusely; my arse. The wet jeans have been pulling at my arse hair - all day. It's been mild torture; pulling out each hair, one by one, slowly.
If the rest of my body has been sweating all this time as busily as my arse, then I must've lost a tonne of fluids...
Maybe I’ve got heatstroke? *Shit*.
I sink a litre of water and pour another litre over my head. Feels good.
Chow time. It's overdue.
I force down a bowl of rice with a boiled river fish that has the taste and texture of thick mud.
It's what I needed; I'm feeling better as I feel the food and water go to work.
After lunch, I resolve to stop at the very next hotel.
Fuck Libreville. I'll do that tomorrow.
---
Sure enough, there's a decent looking hotel on the way out of the village.
I ignore it.
I want to get just a little bit further up the road than this.
*Just a little bit*.
As I crack on, I’m wondering what happens now if - so late in the day, and so exhausted, - I have a simple failure; tyre, chain, cable, whatever. Anything. Anything that stops me and needs a fix.
What happens then?
I hate riding this late in the day with no idea about where I’m going to sleep at night. But I do it again and again and again. I do it because of this baseless drive to push on, go a little further.
If something goes wrong it's going to suck. Hard.
Why the fuck do I do this?
---
I'm an hour since the re-start.
The road has swung around to the north west, up to Libreville.
The jungle has been thinned out. No more beauty.
There's been no villages either... Nowhere I can stay, at least.
I'm getting deeper and deeper in the hole.
The sun setting in the west is blinding my eyes with its glare.
I'd hit a cow at full speed if there was one the road... I can see spitting distance in front of me before blinding white light.
We're somewhere between one hundred and two hundred clicks from the capital, and I can feel myself crapping out again.
I’ve got no idea what options I’ll have for accommodation between here and there, and to stop and ask is time consuming, and I’m quickly running out of sunshine.
There are two villages between here and Libreville big enough to *at least* have sign-posted distances, so I figure they’re my best bet.
Fingers crossed...
---
The first village has nothing...
*Despair.*
Nothing doing.
I have to keep going.
I pass through the equator, again, back to the northern hemisphere.
I’m too tuckered out to take a photo.
I keep riding. Absolutely fucked.
---
Eighty clicks later, and this is my last option...
I'm cooked.
And if this village's got nothing, well... then it's a shit situation of riding at night, knackered, into a capital city.
Why do I insist on painting myself into these corners?
It’s brain dead.
On the outskirts of village number two the road turns to shit.
It's like someone ‘mac’d this thing with nothing but a shovel.
After a whole day's riding and more than four hundred clicks covered, I pull into “Le Como de Flamboyant”, if you’ll believe that.
They’ve got a shoebox room with a toilet and bucket showers and an unenthusiastic host who’s wearing a dress that makes her look like Kermit the Frog, or a colour inverted strawberry.
15,000CFA. Just north of thirty bucks.
That's shit value for a shit room; four times what it should be.
There's another room available. The sheets haven't been changed since the last guest. 12,000CFA. Just north of twenty five bucks.
This is bullshit.
Although I'm exhausted I don't take it. I can't. It's just too outrageous.
I do take directions and go looking for the next place. It’s an "Auberge", which is French for hostel.
It takes some finding. Time I don't have...
Here, they have a room with a bed and a fan.
And a *massive* spider sprawled out on the dried mud wall.
As big as my *fucking hand*.
Mean looking thing.
Looks big and powerful enough to jump clean across the room onto my face.
I ask to look at the bathroom. Filthy communal bucket showers, and an outhouse long-drop to shit in.
"Comby-an?" - How much?
7,500 CFA.
You've got to be fucking *kidding* me. Twenty bucks for a filthy shithole, rooming with a fucking bird eater.
I haggle.
He won't budge a single franc...
I can't do it; waking up in the middle of the night with that spider on my pillow, eight eyes looking at mine... I can't...
I head back to the Flamboyant and take my medicine.
My eyes roll back before my head even hits the pillow...
---
Libreville.
Finally.
On the way into Libreville, The Shrike's horn just completely stopped working. In a capital city a horn is a critical piece of safety equipment. In traffic, I found myself instinctively press the horn button, and on getting nothing, I would end up in a dangerous situation. Things like nearly getting crushed when splitting in gridlock.
I had to use my voice box as a pseudo-horn.
It did the job, but left me hoarse.
The first place I get to has a poster of my hometown on the wall - advertising it as a *holiday destination*.
Bizarre.
I cop a fat pang of homesickness.
While I’m waiting about for someone to haggle with, I notice that there’s a weird red splotch on my hand; a perfect round disk of red the size of a coin, with no raised skin or itchiness or nothing.
Doesn't look like a mosquito bite. This is something new...
Wait. There’s another one...
Aaand another one.
Fuck, here’s another one. And another. *Shit*.
What’s been eating me?
I do a head count and get nine on my left arm and three on my right arm...
The chief’s here.
He wants an astronomical 11,500 CFA a night. Minimum.
Divide 11,500 by 450 in your head... What's that? I can't do it. More than 20, less than 30.
I end up punching him down to ten grand. That'll do. I don't have the fight in me to try anywhere else.
Twenty to thirty bucks gets me a big room with a big bed that isn’t 100% clean; she looks a bit splotchy and tired...
The water doesn't work, but I'm assured that it will be on for an hour each day when the city turns on the water pumps...
In the meantime: Bucket.
The power comes and goes.
It is what it is...
Not pleasant.
I take advantage of the already full bucket and wash off the morning rides sweat and grime. 
The chicken skin on my plucked arse has turned into stubble. Delightful.
To say it feels weird would be a gross understatement.
Moving right along...
---
Libreville is a sweatbox.
The dead, heavy, wet air and the brutal, merciless sunshine combine to make things constantly uncomfortable.
Every pore of skin - the whole body over - is pumping out sweat as fast as it can make it. And when I say the whole body over, I mean the *whole* body over.
Try that, shoehorned into a “share taxi” with seven other humans. That’s seven people in a normal car. Figure that out... After a while you get used to the idea that you don’t know whose sweat is whose and what smell is coming from where anymore.
Rankity rank rank.
Anywho.
I find the Angolan Embassy. And I’m flat out, unceremoniously rejected.
Residents only.
I ask what if I *was* a resident, and they say that it would take fifteen days to issue the visa, which is more than my current Gabon visa will let me stay in the country for...
And just like that, I’m in the shit.
And - just as predicted - I’m going to keep going.
I’m going to go to Congo.
Which is dumb; I know it.
I *know* that I'm painting myself into yet another corner I don’t want to be stuck in. But I'm doing it anyway.
So, *why* am I doing it?
Dunno. No easier idea...
On the way home from the embassy the heavy air has turned into angry thunderclouds which break in one of the most impressive electrical storms I think I’ve ever seen.
I love this shit, it’s got the campfire effect to it; compelling viewing.
I head out into the middle of the street to watch the show.
The lightning is stretching and arcing its way beautifully through the sky. Rather than being a mere fleeting moment it feels like it hangs in the air silently for full seconds before fading.
Stunning. And then the crack and boom and rumble.
It's right overhead.
I’m grinning like an idiot when a bolt strikes so close to where I’m standing it’s like a bomb going off in front of my face.
It’s so close that it’s almost like I hear it a fraction before I see it and then instantly feel it.
I almost fall backwards trying to get back, hands and arms covering my face, everything tingling.
I swear all of the best words.
I reckon that’s quite enough of that...
---
So, after the clusterfizzer that was the Angolan embassy I find myself with a fair bit more Gabon time up my sleeve to kill. Nine days, in fact, till my Congo visa kicks off.
What to do?
Sloth. Of course.
I kill time and more time in my crappy room. I put away about six litres of water every day. And that’s while barely moving.
I hardly piss at all.
I catch a cold. Anyone who tells you that you catch a cold from being cold is full of shit...
I call the family because, amazingly, there is internet here, and it doesn’t suck.
It’s *not* good to see them.
They’re all scared shitless. No one can understand why I would want to go to Congo.
No one seems to get the “why”, and, listening to them, I’m not sure that I know what it is either...
They're all *genuinely* scared.
Their fear and doubt is contagious, and it’s infecting me from half a world away.
It’s not what I need right now. At all.
After I hang up I sit and stare blankly through the computer screen. I don't know how much time passes. Just staring.
I try to hold myself aloof from it, but it’s beaten me: I don’t want to be here anymore; *I want to go home.*
I’m scared.
Skittish.
Damnit. I should be better than this by now. I should be better at keeping a lid on this. New countries shouldn’t hold the fear against me.
But they do.
*Still!*
I'm a veteran at this game, for Christ’s sakes.
Sure, if there was no fear at all the border crossings might get a bit blasé...
Fear - in small doses - introduces excitement and zest.
This is how it should be: Don't be crushed by it, have fun with it. Understand how you're feeling and deal with it head on. If nothing else, think on how insignificant your tiny life is. You are a speck and a blink in the immensity of space and time. My life - which is what everyone is worried about - will end. *I am going to die.* How can I, knowing this, be beaten by fear. Have fear - fear is useful - but be the one dominating it, not the converse. Bravery isn't the absence of fear but the mastery of it. Be brave, be strong.
If it was easy, everyone would do it...
---
On a sudden impulse I head off to the Angolan Embassy, again, to have a crack at getting a super short “transit visa”.
I figure it's worth a shot and "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take," or something like that.
The bloke standing out front of the embassy cracks the shits at me. Something I couldn’t really catch, but I’m guessing was something like “this is an Embassy!” as he points at my hobo pants, which I’ve got rolled up to my knees in a futile attempt to stay cool.
There’s obviously a level of decorum here that I’ve missed, and he’s not impressed.
I roll them down to the ankles and suddenly – even in my pink t-shirt that has gone maroon with sweat and grub, I’m presentable.
Yeah sure...
Anywho, heading inside, my mate from round one of trying to swindle a visa, Maurice, is plainly the opposite of thrilled to see my mug walk into the joint. Again. The conversation goes something like this:
How about a transit visa?
No.
Pretty please?
No.
And that's it...
I guess I was expecting that. No one can say I didn’t try...
---
I kill some more time and distract myself by strolling through the guts of the city of Libreville. It’s pretty modern. There are some baby towers and the local headquarters of a few big, well known, oil companies. But despite how built up it all is the place is oddly quiet, so quiet that I feel the need to whisper, so different from the area that I'm staying in, which is bonkers.
I decide that I like the place - quiet on the inside, crazy on the outside.
---
As I get back to my shithole I finally admit something to myself that I’ve spent the last few days keeping under wraps: I still don’t feel quite right.
It's a sort of difficulty to focus. I can’t focus on something either with my mind or with my eyes that I’d normally have no trouble with. It’s like being unpleasantly spaced out and a little dizzy.
It frightens me a bit because I'm not sure if it's really there or not; it's so vague, so in the background.
What's making me feel like this?
I've thought about it, and all I know is that I don't know.
I’ve no answers, just questions.
If I stop talking about it you'll know that it's come good, just like those red splotches on my arms that have now disappeared...
I’ve decided that I’m not going to spend another week in this room. So tomorrow I’m going to try doing some exploring in Gabon, see what I’ll find.
---
I can’t fucking sleep.
I’ve been lying in this bed with my eyes shut for hours and hours and hours, and when I open my eyes I’m wide awake, completely alert. Not even close...
I get up and read a book. Get bored of that. Try to sleep again.
Hours...
Nope.
Still no good - still not even *close*.
I waste some time on the computer trying to get sleepy. I call my sister who’s just woken up in her part of the world.
I look like shit.
And I’m not exactly sharp...
Mum’s there with her.
Things are a little weird; my reply to her latest frantic email was a little brutal...
Slowly things get going. She says that I’m a good writer, which is surprising.
I've been sending home some updates, but I never really thought anyone would read them.
I've always thought that the only person who enjoys reading shit like that is the person who writes it.
For everyone else it's as boring as batshit for the same reason that going through someone else’s holiday photos is like pulling teeth; you weren't *there*.
A perfect example is Tony the Belgian. Way back in Morocco he made us watch endless hours of video and photos from *his* trips.
He was having a great time. Everyone else is wondering when he's going to have had enough and we can watch a movie or something.
There's nothing worse than someone coming back from a holiday showing you every... single... photo...
*Kill me.*
I figured that the crap I'd sent home would be a yawn fest for all concerned, and that they’d have to read it out of obligation - rather than out of interest.
But, weirdly, it would seem that some people are legitimately enjoying them.
I resolve to put the next big message home in a format that they can read while their sitting on the throne, which, let’s be honest, is probably the time of the day when we digest most of our reading.
Speaking of yawn fests, I’m finally bugging out. At last.
Sleep.
---
Up in the morning like a friggin corpse.
I don’t want to leave today. I’m not up for it. 
So I don’t.
Even though I know it’s not good for me, I don’t.
I kill a whole day glued to this screen, this fucking rectangle.
Doing useless shit.
I feel like a grub.
Is it weird that by illegally downloading some Portuguese lessons off the internet that I feel a real sense of satisfaction, like I’ve actually achieved something?
Pathetic.
The bar is set so low that I feel satisfaction for starting something that I’ll have to *actually* do in the future.
Bizarre.
Killing more time, I retroactively scare the shit out of myself by looking up some official travel advice from the British Government that covers some of the countries that I’ve been to so far.
*What an eye opener...*
The government supplies what I’m calling a "heat map", which is a “traffic lighted” map of each country.
Areas can be green – which is, of course, "no worries", yellow – which is "avoid all but essential travel", and red – which is essentially saying "don’t even think about it".
First, I check Nigeria; it’s red in the north and yellow in the south, kind of like I expected.
Then, Mauritania; I nearly fall off my chair.
Red. Lots of red. Mostly red, in fact. Places I’d been. Places I’ve spent *weeks* in.
*Holy Fuck!*
I had no fucking idea.
*Oblivious.*
The whole of that train trip, and *all* of that Sahara stuff was *red*.
I freak out for *past me*. Which is weird to say the least.
We *hitchhiked* in that!
Bloody good thing I didn’t know about this, or I never would have gone there in the first place.
No chance.
I might have not done Africa at all if I had seen any of *this* while in Spain.
Thank god for happy ignorance. Bliss, apparently.
And I wouldn't have done any of that if not for travelling in a group...
There's definitely a feeling of invincibility in a group. No matter what happens, you’re in it together and you’ll get each other out of the shit if need be. Someone’s got your back. The comfort zone moves way, way out – you can be as brave or as stupid as you want to be.
No fear.
The polar opposite is being alone. You have to take care of yourself. No one else will...
I’ve been taking the easiest, least-risky road because I don’t know if I can deal with something going wrong.
I feel like it’s an opportunity gone begging.
But. The self-discovery, if you can call it that, is magnified in the solitude. I don’t know what it is that I’m learning about myself, but I’m sure it’s something.
Plus, the sense of achievement is magnified. Mundane things in a group, like crossing Nigeria, now become a badge of honour when done solo. I didn’t need anyone’s help; I did it myself.
I reckon I would have felt like I’d cheated had I done it any other way...
But after months of solitude I’m missing companionship.
If a guy rides a motorbike solo through Africa and no one's there to see it, did it ever really happen?
---
After promising myself I’d leave Libreville today and go explore Gabon, I wake up to thunderstorms. I’m stoked: the decision has been taken out of my hands.
I go back to sleep.
The thunderstorms clear. The ball is back in my court again...
I’m going to wimp out.
I take the cop out and decide to kill another day. "Future Me" is furious; Gabon could be something incredible, and I’m wasting a free hit by wallowing in this dump. "Present Me" doesn’t give a single shit.
Show me infinite time and I’ll show you zero motivation.
Another day in the heat.
Another day in my head.
---
Something that I've come to realise, though I'm not 100% certain about it, is that I don't think that I actually miss home.
Well, I do. Of course I do.
I do.
Mum - don’t kill me - I do...
*But...*
As much as I miss home I think I miss *stability* even more.
I reckon, right now, I’d be just as happy to go to London - where I know people - as I would be to go home.
For a little while at least I would like there to be a few less "question marks" in my future.
Well, maybe not less question marks, but less severe ones than the ones that Africa poses. I reckon that's why I've been slothing in Libreville. For three days now there's been absolutely no "what-ifs?" From the security of this hotel room there's nothing that can happen to me - good or bad. And that's been nice. Here, I'm the boy in the bubble, interacting with the world through a safe rectangle.
Nothing can hurt me.
A week ago I thought that all I wanted to be was home again, but after three days of reflection it seems that that's not what I want at all. Being home would thrill me momentarily, but after the initial excitement it would depress me. Honestly, if I was dropped, right now, into home, I would be a complete loose end. I'd have no idea what I’m going to do next...
What I want is for things to be easy for just a little while.
No. No that’s not it.
My hands shake and my throat chokes up as I start to write what it *really* is. And I can’t... I can't write it. But then, I have to.
*I want out of Africa*
Is that it then? Is that what's eating me?
Not that I'm home sick, but rather that I'm done with Africa?
I reckon it might be.
I think that's why in my head I'm getting that feeling of mad desperation for the finish line.
It's not to go home, it's to leave this continent.
Which is odd.
I don't hold any animosity for Africa. I enjoy being here, in fact. I'm totally here on my own volition and under no duress to continue whatever. The stresses are entirely self-inflicted, and the worry of the unknown isn’t that bad at all. It's *me* who's doing the magnifying.
It's all wonderfully analogous to the marathon. No-one makes me run marathons; I do them out of my own choice. But just like the marathon we're at the halfway mark now and the demons are kicking in. And I want it finished with. This ride is a marathon. At the halfway point the cracks begin to form, they tempt you to panic and lift your speed with all that adrenaline. But, just like in a marathon, it's the last ten clicks where you prove your worth, where you learn something about yourself, where you earn that finish line.
The hard way.
I'm going to earn it.
I *will* keep a level head.
I will not take the temptation to blow out of proportion my fear.
I'll make it. Whenever and however that happens, I'll make it. One stride, one day at a time.
I'm good at this.
---
Another sleepless night.
I wish I had drugs.
With all this lazing around, doing nothing, the body’s not sending the message to my brain that it’s time for lights out.
My mind buzzes from one useless thought onto the next.
It's incredible where the mind runs to when given its reins; at one point I catch myself trying really hard to remember precisely the scene from one of the Mission Impossible movies, the scene where they’re swapping diamonds for nuclear launch codes in a skyscraper in Dubai...
Fuck knows why my head went there, but, rest assured, if I traced it back - thought by thought - it would make sense where that thread started. Somehow.
Makes me wonder where else my brain’s been running off to when I’m not watching.
---
It's bright...
I must have finally nodded off at some point.
The morning's come, all too soon...
I don’t want to go.
Again.
My safe little hovel that I’ve feathered out is dragging on me to stay – just one more day.
But this time I’m not giving myself the option.
After the usual morning grind of a miserly bucket shower, a greasy breakfast, packing up all my shit and humping it out onto the bike in the already filthy heat, I'm away.

## Chapter Fourty Six
I learn from my mistakes.
I stop often, drink often, lunched big and early, piss regularly, stop for photos, slow on the speed, light on the throttle.
Smell the roses.
The ride is so, so much better for it.
I pass the equator, again.
The whole wet and sweaty riding jeans ripping out my arse hair is really starting to give me the willies. So much so that I reckon I might try powdering my bum with talcum powder, like a baby, to keep it dry so that everything slides around like it should.
It's killing me *that much*.
I break after half a day's ride at a place called *Ndjole*. That'll do.
I shack up at a shitty hotel, paying an outrageous 8,000 CFA (twenty-ish bucks).
I think that a lot of sex happens here... The first room I took a look at had playboy bunny sheets. Classy. The playboy bunny room had air conditioning, which doubled the price, so I took the fan room instead.
It’s a pretty cool village, this one. It's situated right on that big wide river I was talking about before - which is still moving at a hell of a clip - and is surrounded by green mountains.
It's got a solid fresh food market, lots of tiny bars and a "strip" where everyone is cooking up mystery meats.
My kind of place.
---
I can’t sleep. Again.
It must be so late...
With two days of very little sleep, and a violent rain smashing on the tin roof, I should be out like a light.
Nope.
I can't stop tossing and turning. Restless.
Someone downstairs starts playing jungle drums...
Loudly...
Fuck them.
Then *bass*. From speakers. Bass so loud and heavy I can *feel* it as much as I can hear it.
Is this place a *club*??
Shithouse.
---
The village is soaked through.
Big, deep puddles everywhere and heavy clouds about, but it's not raining now.
I grab a greasy omelette and coffee, and again I entertain the idea of staying put, using the "wetness" as an excuse.
Not good enough.
I’m locked and loaded by mid-morning.
Before taking off I check the chain tension with my finger. It's actually quite loose. *Really* loose, in fact. That's a bit disturbing, since the last time I tensioned it I probably overdid it, and that was only maybe a thousand clicks ago...
I did Mechanical Engineering 101 (or something like that...) back in university, so I know that this probably means it's in a "plastic deformation" phase (or something like that...) meaning failure is just around the corner. Not good.
But, then again, given that I’ve been sweating on the chain failing ever since France, it's done remarkably well and vastly exceeded all of my expectations.
But that doesn’t mean I won’t be pissed off if it craps out on me in the middle of nowhere...
Right, moving on.
We’re off to national park land.
It’s a great start to the day.
Right off the bat I’m happy to just chug along in 4th gear - the slower the better.
I’m grinning like an idiot and waving to everyone. Today’s only a hundred-ish click jaunt, and it’s always these short days that bring out this slow and happy headspace in me.
It's a great way to travel, and I’m sitting somewhere between happiness and near euphoria.
I love this shit.
I come around a corner and take in a scene in the space of a few seconds.
It’s a checkpoint. It doesn’t look legit... They’re not uniformed, and Gabon’s been pretty tight on that so far. They’re being overly aggressive with people already stopped. There’s lots of yelling. The big guy doing most of the yelling’s got a massive shotgun that he’s making a point of waving around.
*Fuck*.
I pull up because they make me.
This guy’s not into my "Sorry for my bad French, haha, what is your name?" icebreaker routine, he’s straight to business - no pleasantries.
“Insurance.” I give him the Laissez-Passer instead.
“Non! *Insurance*...” Damnit. He gets it.
“Identity card.” I give him my passport this time. I get off the bike and take a drink. He's going through the papers with the bloke with the shotgun; they’re making noises about a permit...
“Permit por-qua?” I ask. He hands me back my papers, squeezes my saddlebags a few times and then without a word just walks off...
*Is that it then??*
Shit, I’m not waiting around to find out.
I’m out of there.
Despite being, I guess, legitimate, it's spooked me. Bad.
Must’ve been the shotgun.
And I was having such a nice morning...
The cheesy euphoria has given way to a drained, deep lethargy.
I feel like shit.
Exhausted in my bones.
I take the turn off for the "N3", my road to the national park.
Stoked: it's still tarmac.
Around the first bend and the tarmac gives way to red dirt...
Figures.
It’s not exactly surprising that they haven’t bothered to tar a road; according to the maps, there's less-than-bugger-all out here.
---
It's a much slower ride and, as always, a bit of a head fuck.
Riding solo off the beaten track is a mind job.
It's remote out here, un-trafficked, hardly any villages to speak of.
If something goes tits up that requires some assistance (because I’ve got no idea what I’m doing) help is going to be a very, *very* long time coming.
And there's no "legging it to the next village" either; there's fucking *no one* out here.
My mind sprints in the hamster wheel of useless, going nowhere, "what ifs".
Busted chain. That's going to suck, but I can probably fix it by myself.
It's the tyres that gets me... Again and again and again; It's the chink in my "what if" armour. I'm not sure if I could do a tyre change with my pissy little tyre irons all by myself. And even if I can, I don't have a pump... Normally, that wouldn't be a problem. Because normally there are people around...
The path is rocky and heavily corrugated.
Puncture-ville.
It'd worth having a simple hand pump in the bag just to get it out of my head.
If something goes wrong, I'm sorta fucked...
Forgetting all that; I'm on a gorgeous red dirt track that hasn’t turned completely to shit in the rain.
We dance together up and down and around deep green mountains, thick with rain forest. The sky is heavily overcast, making it a perfect temperature to ride. The whole thing, and the thumping, sweet Enfield, it’s all a thing of beauty.
And all I can think of, *still*, is something going wrong.
It *shits* me.
It takes a conscious and near constant effort to try to keep my mind positive, and stay in the "here and now". The present - where absolutely nothing is wrong and everything is delightful.
And it *is* delightful.
Just me and the green.
---
After a while in the thick crowding jungle, I blink, and the whole world transforms. Gone is the jungle in a twinkling. Replaced with an utterly cleared, rolling, mountainous grassland, that after the claustrophobia of the jungle seems to go on *forever*.
I’ve got to stop the bike and take a moment...
Stunning.
Jaw dropping...
I love being surprised. Surprised and delighted. This is *awe inspiring*.
The sheer size of the sudden expanse, green grassland all the way to a hilly horizon.
I'm like Bambi on the edge of the meadow.
I wonder if we people only find beauty in *contrasts*. In music, it's the unexpected change in the music that induces shivers up our spine...
I can't tell if this latest change is natural or man-made. Natural doesn't make sense. The altitude, I don't think, shifted *that* much. But man made doesn't check-out either; the area seems too *vast*. Plus, if you log an area you don't get grasslands, you get shitty little trees and saplings. Here, there’s nothing but grass and hills and mountains forever and ever.
As I crack on into the grasslands, letting the weight of the bike roll us down a decline, I’ve got my arms spread out, flying down the hill. I'm yelling into my helmet
"*This is what it's all about!! This is it*!"
And it is.
*This* is why I wanted to go exploring; it's to be as thoroughly wowed as this.
In an instant it feels like the whole journey has been vindicated, again.
I try my horn again. I feel like making some noise.
On the third push it comes to life again! Scares me!
Even the Enfield is healing out here.
---
As we get closer to our destination - *Lope* - a river comes along. It’s a *huge* bastard. I think it might be the same one as before, but here it seems to be somehow both wider and faster.
It’s *immense* and absolutely ripping along.
A fearsome beautiful thing.
I love it out here.
---
I cruise into Lope somewhere in the afternoon.
I follow some signs to a hotel sort of lodge sort of thing. It's a long way out of the main village but it looks pretty decent so I reckon I’ll have a crack.
I ask how much for a night and I *swear* they say 520,000 CFA. I double check. Then triple check.
I’m sure of it.
Divide that by 450…
That’s over a thousand bucks.
For one night!
Bloody hell.
*Surely not*.
I don't know any other number that sounds like “sank sant vant mill.” Sank, five. Sant, hundred. Vant, twenty. Mill, thousand.
Fuck a duck.
Back to Lope then...
---
I quickly find another joint. It's perfect. Ideal.
It's the best value place I've found in Gabon, by a long way. 5,500cfa for the night - the cheapest in Gabon by something like half.
It's clean. It has a mosquito net. The communal shower works a treat. So does the toilet. The sheets are even new and vibrant and colourful.
I’m totally stoked with it.
Lope is *a lot* smaller than I had expected. It's so small in fact, that there's nowhere that sells petrol...
I was assuming, and fairly, that just like the rest of Africa there'd be *someone* selling bottles of petrol.
Nope.
While I’m chowing down a whole chicken deep fried out of all recognition (fucking delicious mind you), I ask the chef how much further along till there's petrol.
*Two hundred and eighty clicks* down the road...
Fuck fuck fuck *fuck*.
Why the hell didn’t I add some more juice in at the last stop!
Idiot!
Fuck *shit*!
The last time I refuelled was... what? Fifty clicks outside Libreville, on the way *into* Libreville.
-ish...
So that means fifty clicks plus yesterdays ride of 250-ish, plus today's ride of 120-ish. That makes 420km.
Four hundred and twenty kilometres since I last refuelled...
That's a lot.
I chow the rest of the chicken and go check The Shrike.
Enfields don't have a fuel gauges...
I have to pop the cap and rock the bike around.
There’s fuck all swishing around in there...
How the *hell* did I not think of this?
With this much fuel I’ll be lucky to make it back the hundred plus clicks back the way I came without having to get off and push...
As for going 280 clicks forward? Forget about it.
*Fuck!*
I head back to the "restaurant", and ask the chef if there's anyone in the village with petrol in jars.
He doesn’t think so. He heads off to make enquiries.
He quickly comes back and it's good news, the bloke down the road about a kilometre sells jars of “essence”.
Thank *fuck* for that.
I kill the afternoon by taking a walk of the tiny village, and then sit on a log and read a book till the mozzies come out and force me to move on.
I head off to the part of the village with the guy who sells fuel.
He's fresh out...
*FUCK!*
I plead but he really does have nothing. Not a drop.
Alternatives...
Siphon fuel and pay someone? The big hotel might have their own supply.
Then it hits me like a thunder bolt - I *did* fill up after Libreville. How did I forget about that??
Jesus I must've been out of my mind...
Crisis averted.
This next leg might be a tight one though!
---
Finally, a good night’s sleep is in the books.
Halle-fuckin-lujah.
I head to breakfast with my mate the greasy chicken chef. 1,300 coins for an omelette with coffee. Three dollars. Bloody pricey, this joint.
First item on today’s agenda is where to find the next petrol along to road heading east. Apparently the place to go is called Lastoursville. That's good, I’ve seen that on the maps, it's only a couple of hundred clicks away. I *should* be able to get that done on the current tank of juice. Good good.
I then ask about Koulamoutou - the next town along the line. Yep, that's got petrol as well.
Bonza. All's looking good.
I ask the chef about the road from Koulamoutou to Ndende?
He says the road's no good.
Shit. I poke my head out the door and point up to the road where I came from yesterday, a useful benchmark. Like that?
No. He then does his best charades of bouncing a motorbike into a craterous pothole...
Fuck.
It’s only just now occurred to me that I never stopped to think and re-assess the plan after yesterday’s ride. Seems crazy in hindsight.
Better late than never. Yesterday’s one hundred clicks of breaking new ground on the “N3” took me roughly 3 hours. It wouldn't have been safe to go much faster given the corrugations and the rocks. In the whole ride there wasn't a single real functioning village. A few abandoned villages here and there and maybe the occasional one or two with a human. No places to stay, no petrol, no food. Not much traffic either, maybe a vehicle every half hour, I reckon. And this is the N3 - a major road - the connection between the capital and “Franceville”, which, I’m told, is the third largest city in the country.
It never occurred to me that the roughly three hundred click road from Koulamoutou to Ndende - from nowhere to nowhere - might be an untraveled, empty, nightmare of a road.
It’s occurring to me now though...
And, just like that, bang, it goes from looking totally do-able to crazy. This isn't like Liberia or Cote d'Ivoire where there’s a bunch of small rural villages on the road that I can use as a get out of jail free card should the shit hit the fan.
No.
I know I can make it to Koulamoutou, I know I can make it to Franceville if need be. But what happens from there? Three hundred *offroad* clicks in a day? I don't think it's possible. Not for me...
And then what? Where are you going to sleep? What are you going to eat? What if something goes wrong? What if the road is impassable? What if you get sick? What if you have a prang?
What if? What if? What if?
What if you do something as simple as puncture a tyre, and there's zero traffic. Lie back and think of England. Because you're fucked.
Literally, if just about anything doesn't go just right, in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, you've *had it*.
There's being adventurous and then there's being stupid and reckless. All of a sudden I've crossed the line. "Death by misadventure" again.
I’m not happy with this, at all. Even though I know it might all end in tears I still want to crack on; I *hate* backtracking and yesterday's left me with an appetite to see more of Gabon.
The other option is to go a little further south east of Lastoursville to a place called Moanda, and then head south to cross into the Congo. But that leaves 200km of unknown Congo back roads, with no alternatives, which might be even less appealing than the Gabon "N6".
It's not looking good.
I don't even have the time to go and have a look and then, if it’s a balls up, retrace my steps; my Gabon visa ends in under a week, to get to the Congo border from Franceville, the long way around, is a colossal distance, and on a lot of dirt to boot.
Fuck it all.
I’m going back the way I came.
And I hate myself for it.
What’s worse? To regret that you’re a pansy? Or to regret that you’re an idiot?
I wish I wasn’t alone out here. It’d be a different story altogether.
---
While I’m getting my shit in a pile to take off I get talking to a couple of truckers who are sitting about, taking the air. I explain to the truckers what I wanted to do and they tell me that the road from Franceville to Dolisie via Oyo is all paved, “pas de problem.”
Bullshit! *Paved*! You serious??
The pendulum swings, again.
I run off to grab my GPS so I can find Oyo, excited that I might have just snagged a life.
And... Nope.
Well, not really.
Oyo is *way* out east, near Cameroon. Sort of. The route they were describing was Franceville-Oyo-Brazzaville-Dolisie. All of it has been 'mac'd. Apparently.
I'd rather avoid Brazzaville if I can...
I explain to the truckers that I want to go from Moanda to Dolisie.
Nope. According to the truckers, the road's no good.
The pendulum swings right back again.
I give up, load up The Shrike and get ready to peel out.
I'm about to turn on the bike when by habit I reach into my pocket to grab the GPS.
It's not there...
The cold fizz in the head and frantic pat of every pocket followed by a statue - One hand on my arse pocket, the other clasping my inner jacket pocket.
*Shit!*
I fly back to the room, which, as is my custom, was already turned upside down before I left, so I turn it right side up again.
Nothing. Where the *fuck* would it be? Did I leave it at breakfast? No. Ah!! It's in the toilet, that’s it, I remember!
Big strides down the hallway to the communal toilet.
It's not there.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck *FUCK!!* Someone's taken it, either to steal it, or maybe to report it lost.
In my head - concurrent with the panic - I'm already thinking of how I'll travel without it. Thinking of how I'll make it work; it's a fairly critical bit of kit and it's almost irreplaceable in this part of the world - you just can’t buy them. My head is a blur but already I'm making plans for how it will all be ok. And this is all happening between the ears in the fractions of seconds it takes me to close the toilet door. The brain and all those panic chemicals can be a hell of a thing.
Then it hits me, the shower!
And yes, thank Christ, there it is. I'd put it down to wash my hands and then left it there on the sill.
*Fark mee*.
I breathe again.
Very lucky to jag that one.
That's quite enough excitement for one morning...
Take two. Let's get out of here.
---
I absolutely flog it back the way I came.
I know that it’s not necessary, but sometimes I just feel the need for speed. I've seen the scenery already so I’ve got no qualms about gluing my eyes to the road and just hammering it.
It’s great fun.
The combo of familiarity with the track, and the fact it’d dried out some overnight, brought on a bit of a loss of respect and an increase in complacency.
I’m moving fast and fancy free.
Bang. Right out of fucking nowhere with no warning around a blind corner there’s a fucking speeding truck.
I’ve got to react like a mongoose.
I nearly get murdered.
Because I’m all alone out here I’ve been using *all* of the dirt road to pick out the best, smoothest track. Left side, right side, right up the middle, it didn’t matter.
I was on the wrong side of the road.
No time to think and I swerve the bike over, hard to the side, and miss the truck by *nothing.*
I still can’t believe it didn’t hit my back wheel.
Tweak a couple of the variables, either speed, reaction time, a bit sooner or a bit later on the corner from either of us, him in the middle of the track, a little less luck and I’m dead.
Scared the absolute shit out of me.
I have to pull over to walk off the shakes.
Helmet off and it’s all quiet again. Peaceful, calm, still and serene.
No one’s dying.
I’m side saddle on the bike calming down and looking absently into the jungle when the tree right behind me on the roadside starts rustling I turn in a snap to see what it is, but it’s stopped.
I stare at it, hard. Even though it's was just spitting distance away I can't see a thing.
It sounded very close... But it’s quiet now.
There’s another movement in the corner of my eye, away to the right, way up the road, and I turn to Look. High in the trees, maybe fifty steps away, there’s branch moving, like something's just jumped off it or onto it. Must be monkeys...
I’m straining to catch a glimpse. Straining to hear something.
But everything is quiet and calm again.
A snort like a furious bull comes from out of nowhere, right next to my head, *roaring* through the silence.
I *shit a cinder block*.
I snap my head to look back into the jungle behind me and in the same motion swing my leg over the bike.
I blindly twist the key and hit the ignition without taking my eyes off the green and I *get the fuck out of there.*
I didn't see *anything*. Nothing.
Do they have fucking *gorillas* here??
Jesus tap-dancing *Christ*. Why didn't anyone tell me they have fucking gorillas!? It couldn't have been anything other than a very pissed off gorilla; an elephant wouldn't fit in jungle that thick.
I'd love to see a gorilla; but not that fucking close... All I can imagine is King Kong pealing out of the jungle and ripping my limbs off.
There was menace in that snort. Like whatever the fuck it was wanted to send a clear message: Fuck, off.
Message received...
My heart won't stop.
And here I was worried about trucks...
---
Not long after shitting a metaphoric brick, I start to drop my guts with a disturbing, unusual regularity.
Big one's...
Ominous.
Trucks be damned. I *fly*.
As I get back to the tarmac road I’m starting to cramp up. Badly.
Not good...
*Really* not good.
I wring the throttle and smash the tarmac like a man possessed.
I make amazing progress, but I already know it's in vain.
We've been here before; it was on a boat off the shore of Guinea-Bissau...
I *will not* tempt fate again.
I concede defeat, pull over, and run into the jungle.
*Whoosh...*
That gorilla's *literally* scared the shit out of me.
The jungle insects come out of the woodwork for this.
I think of a huge gorilla sneaking up on me while I'm taking a furious shit.
March flies are already biting my arse.
At least I hope they're march flies...
Even though I'm not entirely evacuated I reckon it's enough to make it back to Ndjole without further incident.
All in all, not as harrowing an experience as I thought it would be.
Excepting the boat incident, it's my first unsupervised crap in the wild. I'm almost proud of myself.
Nah, bugger it, I *am* proud of myself.
So what?
---
I pull into Ndjole, again.
I’ll be buggered if I’m staying in the seedy joint with the playboy sheets and the rave happening downstairs again. Stuff that.
I try a joint called the “hotel de ville”, which sounds like it must be evil and kidnap dalmatian puppies...
I interrupt a bloke taking a kip out on the front porch in the sunshine. He's a bit confused when I ask for a room. I ask again. He looks genuinely confused... tells me no, there are no rooms.
What?? No rooms in a *hotel*.
No.
We both just stare at each other. He seems to be as confused as I am.
None of it makes any sense.
In any case, it seems that that’s not an option, so I wish him a nice day and go head to my hotel/nightclub.
Same room and everything.
---
Still can't sleep.
I'm sick of this sucky foam mattress. It's another one of those one's that you just drown in.
Tossing and turning, then I *feel* something big crawl onto my head from the pillow.
*Big* big. 
Calmly I swish it off my forehead with a flick of the wrist (calmly?? How the hell am I so calm??). It goes flying over to the side of the bed. I scramble for a light.
It’s the biggest cockroach I’ve seen in my life. Some abomination of nature. One of those huge flying bastards.
Yuck.
How the *hell* has it got past the mozzie net??
I can’t believe how calm I am. How calm I was. I would have expected that an unexpected visitor on my head in the middle of the dark night would have scared the bejeezus out of me and left me dancing a wild, slapping jig.
*Especially* after seeing that bird eating spider the other day...
I lift up the mozzie net and backhander the roach somewhere across the room. Live and let live, right?
Plus, if I smush the thing it’s going to make a hell of a mess.
---
Over days the beauty of Gabon fades.
I'm just getting the miles done to get to the border.
The road is in good nick, and I make good progress.
There’s lots of very small villages, so there’s no need to worry about getting in the shit – there’s always an easy out.
On the road there’s always waving, screaming, smiling kids, and friendly villagers, always ready with a big smile and a wave.
They’re a very friendly bunch.
Except where it comes to animals...
There’s obviously a very healthy "bushmeat" trade happening in these villages, and the wares are displayed on the roadside for potential buyers.
There ain’t no wildlife conservation here. No sir...
I’ve seen a *tonne* of animals strung up.
There are creatures that look like a gofer sort of rat that are the size of dogs; small crocodiles or alligators or whatever; jungle cats, yep, flecking jungle cats! They look like a spotted leopard mixed with a large house cat. Shame it’s dead, it'd make an awesome pet; there are tiny pygmy antelope looking things; another great pet if it wasn't dead; and then something that looks like an armadillo. I don’t even know what an armadillo looks like, but I reckon this is something like it - it looks like it’d roll up in a ball for self-defence; I even see a *toucan*, or I’m guessing it’s a toucan. It looks like the cartoon versions of a toucan that I know, anyway. Huge beak, colourful. Dead.
And then there’s the monkeys. They’re ubiquitous.
And terrible.
The worst.
The post-mortal cruelty ratchets a notch for these tragic monkeys...
It’s like the locals have a little competition going to see who can put on the *least* humane display. It’s full on.
Some are hung up by the arms like they’ve been crucified; some by the legs, upside down; some by their tail which is also tied around their neck like a choking noose; some are cooked and splayed open like a starfish, gutted right up their middle. All of them have a grotesque grimace on their face, teeth bared, like they are frozen in the agony of their death. The eyes are the most disturbed, locked in a squint of terrible pain.
It makes me shudder every time. It’s fucking awful.
How does anyone find that *appetising*?? Who's eating this??
Anyway, it’s been a few days of long rides, shitty accommodations, and all in all, fairly uneventful.
About the only thing worth noting was running into a couple of travellers in a van while at a rare Gabonese checkpoint. They were a young couple from Switzerland. Two modern-day hippies.
We did the whole "you're white, I'm white, we should probably talk" thing.
Their van did a transformer routine, and out comes a picnic bench and seats.
We pored over maps and shared war stories.
They’re doing a lap of Africa in the other direction to me – going down the east coast and now coming up the west.
The adventurous are always interesting, or maybe it was all the choof they’d been smoking - the van reeked of it.
Anywho. They reckon that the east coast was a little too touristy and a little too developed. I assured them that the west coast wouldn’t have the same problem...
They reckon that Angola was a breeze, and all of the roads have been ‘mac'd.
*Brilliant*.
They tell me to be ready for a bit of a grind though, as the roads in Congo are a bit shit. Muddy, apparently. Though I'm sure that after nothing but tarmacked roads for them that they struggled with any wet dirt road...
They reckon that the Congolese - in both countries - were the nicest people they had met so far on the trip. *Big call*. And the border crossings are a breeze; no one ever gave them any grief.
All good news then!
I tell them not to be scared of Nigeria, and that Yamoussoukro is not to be missed.
It's odd that I don’t have much more to tell them.
They’ll figure it out.
Anyhow, it was nice, if only for a little while, to see other travellers; it's been since Ghana since I've met any other travellers out on the road.
Made for a cheerful afternoon ride.
---
Early to rise.
That familiar rising dread. It must be a border day.
Sixth day straight in the saddle.
My guts has taken it to the next level overnight, despite me not giving it too much ammunition in the top end.
It’s been about an hour of throne time in total across five different attempts trying to clear this cramp. I reckon I’ve sort of got it in the end, at least as well as I’m going to for today.
Fingers crossed there’s no more emergency evacuations.
It's three hundred clicks between here and Dolisie, with nothing in between on the maps except a border.
Even though three hundred clicks is big, I have to get it done, there are no alternatives.
---
While I’m brimming the Shrike with fuel I get a bloke interrupting me, telling me to come and see him at 'Immigration' before I leave.
Hmmm. Not sure I will...
I reckon it’s just another official wanting to be a pain in the neck, and I usually avoid that sort of thing. Plus, we're nowhere near the border yet.
But, thinking about it, and how it all went down with the Gabonese on the way in, with the stamps all happening miles away from the border actual, I reckon I’ve got to check it out.
I ride over to where the random bloke was directing me, and it's legit.
Thank fuck I stopped here and didn't get turned around at the border to come back, a good forty clicks away; an eighty click round trip.
That would have sucked. Hard. My long day would have become impossible.
They stamp my passport.
---
About an hour out of Ndende, on not-so-bad-road, I hit the Gendarmes who catch all of my details. It’s just one bloke in a gutted out house, all by himself. Then it’s on to the border post proper.
I’m not sure what these blokes are, but they want *all* my details.
They offer me some palm wine, and then ask for some money for whisky.
With a bit more hassle than usual, I’m out of Gabon.
It’s been fun.

## Chapter Fourty Seven
Hello, Congo!
It doesn’t even sound like a country. It sounds more like a mystical, made up place.
“The Congo...”
There's no more evocative a name anywhere on the continent.
The border post is butted up against a gate on the road, with a few buildings and some other clingers-on.
Getting into “The Congo” turns out to be equally a hassle; everyone wants my details and papers but no one wants to give me what I need.
The Police, then two lots of Gendarmes, and then the Douane. And I've still got no stamps or papers. Nothing.
It’s all taking a bloody long time. Time I don't have.
I'm anxious to get going
On the second trip to the cops I get my stamp - they didn't want to stamp me in till they were sure that I'd been to see *everybody*.
Apparently I can get papers for the bike later; as there’s no one between here and Dolisie to give me the shits anyway...
I’m about to head off but one of the cops is trying to tell me something.
My French isn’t really good enough to catch it... He’s talking about a *path*, or something to do with *listening*. I’ve got no idea what he’s driving at.
I apologise and ask him to repeat himself - and he does - but it’s in one ear and out the other. I can’t catch any of it, which is a shame because he seems pretty earnest about it. I'm a little embarrassed...
I apologise again and he gives up, wishes me good luck, and I'm off.
I round the first corner, and straight away I'm faced with an impossibly long puddle.
Fucking hell.
It just keeps *going*.
I spend a good minute with the bike in idle, hand on the clutch, just staring at it, because I can’t do anything else...
It’s impossible. Impassable.
I know already it can’t be done. It’s too big.
Something tells me it's deep. I can just *tell*.
Hopeless...
The dirt road is lined with African scrub so thick that I’m no chance to bush bash around it. And even if I could, there’d probably be mud under that too...
The dry scrub is higher than my head. Like a stone wall....
The nearest other road is two *hundred* kilometres away.
This is it. For the next three hundred clicks: *this...* 
What *the fuck* am I supposed to do now?
Nothing else for it but to have a crack. I guess... What else can I do?
Before I have the chance, two kids from the border village have come running and jumping and screaming out of the scrub.
They're waving for me to follow them into the scrub.
They sherpa me off to the side where there’s a tiny, hidden bypass track.
Thank *Christ*.
I scratch the Shrike through the scrub, and pop out into what looks like the cleared front yard of someone’s hut... That’s a bit rude, and none too subtle...
The track wind’s around other huts parallel to the road. *Everyone’s* staring at me as the kids lead me around the huts and scrub like the pied piper.
We poke back out onto the road at the other end of the puddle.
Excellent!! Thanks kids!
---
It's one deep muddy quagmire after another, some of them are properly deep; the trucks have come through and carved out *deep* tyre tracks that fill with brown water. It's impossible to gauge how deep a puddle is until I'm swimming in it. Well, that's not true, I *could* get off the bike and walk it first, but doing that every half-click for three hundred clicks isn't exactly a practical solution...
Anyway, from what I’ve learnt in Cameroon, puddles usually look a lot worse than they are. I just have to do my best to divine the right track and go for it.
Left side, right side, down the middle. Pick and go.
I pick a right.
Go for it.
The bike buries the front tyre into watery mud and I lose momentum fast. The exhaust note drowns with the pipe going under the water.
*We’re not going to make it.*
I *wring* the throttle but we're still slowing down.
Progress is down to inches at a time. *We're not even half-way.*
The engine’s still giving a muffled roar, as I vault off the bike and into the puddle, keeping the throttle pinned.
I push. I push but instead of the bike moving forward my legs just sink deeper backwards into the mud.
Up to the knee.
Every straining inch I gain by pushing and lifting is lost again when I reset to have another push, sucked back into the mud.
The motor is screaming; the tyre is just a water-wheel of brown. 
Wet brown shit's going *everywhere.*
I can't stop. If I stop, it's over.
I take two deep breaths. I give it all I’ve got. I throw my whole body into it. This is my *only* shot. It *has to* work.
I can *feel* the adrenaline, the kind of adrenaline that lets people lift flipped cars.
Five seconds of ultimate effort.
I make no progress.
There are *meters* left to go.
I can't.
I stop pushing.
The throttle is still going, the wheel still spinning.
I can't let it stop. Can't.
But what else can I do?
I panic.
With another bolt of adrenaline I heave again.
The veins in my head are going to explode under the pressure.
The bike moves forward an inch.
I push again.
It *has to work!!*
Nothing. It doesn't move at all.
I roll off the throttle and the engine dies with a plop and a bubble.
*Silence.*
I look around. All at once I realise how completely alone I am out here.
How isolated. How vulnerable. How very not bulletproof.
I can feel my neck tighten. Choking up. Mouth turns down.
Like I'm about to *cry*...
Jeesus. Must be bad...
I let go of the handlebars and the bike just stands there all by itself; the mud’s that thick that it’s holding it upright.
Welcome to the Congo...
---
Alright then. SitRep.
The Shrike can die in three different ways:
One, the exhaust pipe fills with mud and water that the engine can’t clear the blockage, choking it.
Two, the motorbikes "computer", is right on the mudline, if water gets into that box with the electronics it's gonna be game over.
Three, the air box, which is on the other side of the bike, is also just above the mudline. If mud gets sucked through the air box and into the engine where things go “bang”, who knows what that could do...
Any one of them will be fatal for the bike, and might even kill the journey.
And that’s just the showstoppers, the lesser impacts of covering everything in thick mud can’t be great.
Oright. Better get on with it.
The back wheel has dug a watery hole down past the axle.
The saddlebags are *just* clear of the mudline, but they’ve still copped a shitload of mud from the back tyre painting everything brown.
I reckon that without the bags and me sitting on the Shrike I might be able to push it out of the shit.
I chuck the bags, the spare tyre and the tent into the scrub.
I suck in a few deep ones, getting ready for another ultimate effort.
Turn the key and hit the ignition, The Shrike fires up without a moment’s hesitation. I can't believe it... I drop the clutch, pin the throttle and push like hell.
Without the saddlebags to parry and block the mud it’s making a right fuckin mess.
Mud fills the sky.
Regardless of the lighter weight, we're going nowhere fast.
I let the engine die again.
I try lifting the front and then the back wheel out of the mud.
It's the biggest effort I've made, just a straight up deadlift where I can use *all* of my strength.
Each effort buys me an inch up and out of the mud. But the moment I stop straining it gets sucked right back down to square one. 
I'm *not* going to be able to do this by myself.
Time to wait. I guess.
---
Ok, it’s obvious that no one’s coming.
Despite this being the main border with Gabon, it’s not particularly popular – I’ve hardly seen anyone on this road since I started out this morning. Hours ago.
There's no option. I've got to walk back to the border.
I sling the muddy saddlebags over my shoulder. I'm past caring about a little more mud now. I'm caked with a thick layer of wet brown from my boots to my waist, with flicks of brown covering the rest of me pell-mell.
It looks like I've been dipped in chocolate.
I grab my jacket too, and wetly trudge it back to the border post, mud squirming between my toes.
I don't even go around the puddles; my boots can't get any wetter...
---
I've already got raging blisters on my feet.
I feel knackered.
---
I'm finally within cooee of the border post when I hear motorbikes coming from the direction I’ve *just come from*.
They've managed to negotiate the mud...
I stop and drop my bags and wait for them.
Around the corner come two scooters.
Two tinny little Chinese made *scooters*. 
*SCOOTERS!?*
How the actual fuck have they made it through the shit??
Unbelievable. I literally do-*not*-believe it.
It must be written on my face.
The first bloke to ride past me just laughs at me and keeps going.
The second bloke is *pissed off*.
He’s chewing me right out, pointing in my face and giving me an angry earful in French. I'm not sure what he's saying, but I know I'm being chastised... He's waving his arm around, pointing back in the direction of The Shrike.
Wait... Did he just call me an idiot??
*Crazy* was definitely in there: *"Foo"*.
I can't make any sense of any of this - the whole situation.
Why is *he* pissed. What's it to him? How's it any skin off his nose that I'm stuck?
The dots just don't join up...
Now he’s yelling something about a *"piste"*. A path. Something about “making your own path” or some shit like that.
Despite looking fucking miserable, and covered in shit, neither one of them offers to help me out. They ride on to the border post...
*Arseholes*.
---
The scooter riders have given the handful of people at the village the story before I can: the dumb-fuck is stuck in the mud, because he’s a fucking idiot...
It was written all over me in mud anyway.
The only explanation I’ve got to offer is a shrug and a sheepish grin.
No other explanations required.
I think they’re gonna help me.
No one actually says it, but I get the feeling they’re gonna give me a hand.
But they’re in no rush.
About half an hour of sitting about later, killing time, a group of four who have a truck finally finish their lunch and hop into their truck. There’s no space for me in the cab through, and so, exhausted, and with really pissed off feet, I’ve got to trudge back to the bike through the mud again.
---
It’s a long, quiet walk.
---
They’ve beaten me back to the bogged bike by a fair bit, and two of them have already stripped down to nothing but their underwear and waded barefoot into the mud. They're trying to lift the bike out on their own. Wasn’t expecting that... Neither three naked blokes, nor for them to be making such an effort without me.
But they’re not going far fast, the suction of the mud is too strong.
I drop my bags and wade in to give them a hand.
Even with three of us it’s a struggle, the mud is just too *awkward*.
With a full effort from all three of us we manage to break the pull of the sucking mud and haul the bike out backwards and back onto dry land.
She’s an absolute mess.
*Covered* in shit. There’s mud *everywhere*.
The truck driver offers to put the bike in the back of the truck so we can take it to a mechanic to fix it.
Good chance...
I bang the keys in, press the ignition and she starts.
Everyone's surprised.
I give it a few revs and the exhaust pipe vomits a lot of mud and water.
Projectile vomiting.
It clears. The Shrike seems pretty content. Just another day...
Unbelievable.
I’m grinning like an idiot.
You *can’t* kill this bike. You just *can't*.
What a fucking warrior.
The Congo lads are nodding their head in approval.
“Il est fort eh?”
Yeah. It's strong alright.
---
While I’m loading up again - and wondering what to do now - I can overhear the blokes who lifted the bike talking in hushed tones about 5,000 CFA. I don’t think that they think that I have a very good handle of French. I come up to them with a 10,000FA.
They’re even more stoked with the cash than I am with having the Shrike back... They’re literally thrilled.
One of the scooter's are back; looks like they were just doing a round-trip to the border.
He offers to Sherpa me through the shit.
Thank Christ. I won’t be alone.
I fire up the Shrike and brace myself.
I'm curious to see how he's going to handle this puddle that I apparently got so wrong as to meerit a tongue lashing.
Good luck!
He gets a run up and then just vanishes off the road and into the scrub.
*What the fuck?* Where’s he gone? How’d he do that??
I turn the Shrike around and sure enough, there’s a tiny, scratchy goat track that’s been hidden by the thick scrub.
The whole fuzzy picture of nonsense finally snaps into focus in a blink.
*That’s* the way of it...
---
Most of the puddles we still have to go through - and make a mess - but for every one that looks impossible to pass there’s *always* a hidden little goat track somewhere.
Imagine if I had of gotten bogged any further from the border... a hundred kilometres from the border...
*Lucky,* really; getting bogged was *inevitable* without this nugget of know-how.
What I thought of as the worst luck ever got revealed to have been *incredibly* lucky.
This road is without a doubt a top contender for the worst roads of the trip.
Just a bloody mess.
My Sherpa guided me till we reached his mud hut village, and I’m on my own again; but this time I know enough to get it done.
---
I’m tuckered out. Knackered.
Two hours of hard yakka.
I hit a benign looking crest in the middle of two puddled tyre tracks and in the blink of an eye front end slides out sideways like it's on soap, and everything goes for a splash.
The bike into the right tyre puddle, me into the left.
The engine cuts out.
Fucking. Great.
I’ve had enough. The last five riding day’s in succession and then this clusterfuck, all come home to roost at once in the spill. And there’s *still* riding to be done...
I lie face down in the puddle doing a half push up. What a wreck.
I pick myself up, and then pick up the Shrike.
It starts.
We're off again.
I go a ways up the road and pull over for a drink and a break. I need it.
I check that my travel papers and money in my breast pocket aren’t wet...
They are.
*Fuck this!*
The bottom of my passport is damp and brown at the bottom with mud. And the rest of the documents are all a little damp as well.
I guess it could have been worse...
Been saying that a lot today...
---
The rest of the afternoon goes like a hamster wheel. It feels like I’m making no progress at all, and the kilometres being ticked off by the GPS feel like they take an age each.
There are tiny, tiny villages scattered here and there, and when I go past I don’t get any waves. The villagers run out of their huts at me, yelling, and not in a pleasant way either...
They want me to stop... But I don't.
---
It feels very late as I come across the biggest village since the border. Which isn’t saying much. In fact, that’s saying nothing at all. It’s a handful of dingy buildings and a Customs post.
I’m shattered.
I’ve had nothing to eat today except for three bananas for breakfast and a stale baguette for lunch back when I was waiting around at the border post all covered in mud; not nearly enough for today's exertions.
There’s still a couple of *hundred* clicks to Dolisie. I’m not even going to get within cooee of that today, or maybe even tomorrow for that matter.
The Shrike’s starting to sound a little crook too; that tonking noise from Cameroon is back...
The lad at Customs tells me there’s a hotel around the corner down by the river.
That’ll do.
The Douane lad will happily write me a Passavant. That’s a plus.
While he’s doing that I head off to find the hotel.
---
It's a pile of shit.
5,000 CFA a night. Outrageous.
But beggars can’t be choosers...
While I’m offloading my shit I watch my host go grab a bucket of brown water from the muddy riverbank for me to take a shower in.
River water... In *The Congo*...
Suboptimal.
That bucket must be a fucking petri dish...
Speaking of petri dishes; the room.
Good. Lord.
This might be the crappiest place I've ever stayed in.
Yep, I’m calling it.
The crappiest.
It’s dank and dingy and foul smelling.
I’m not sure I’d be happy to stand barefoot on that mattress, I don’t know how I’m going to sleep on it...
And don't get me started on that pillow...
Now, my standards have become pretty low on this trip for accommodation, and I can deal with rank hotel rooms without much fuss, but this is beyond the pale.
In a word: Filthy.
But, there are more pressing matters at hand: The Shrike.
---
Mud. Fuckloads of it.
It's *everywhere*.
Each time I want a new bucket of river water I have to go *barefoot* down the steep muddy riverbank to collect it.
After taking a few trips I cog that those gnarly, fat blisters I picked up today on my feet have burst wide open, and filled with filthy mud.
That can’t be good...
I’m so *done* with this.
I leave the Shrike after doing my best to wash off what I can, and now it's my turn. I head inside and clean myself up with that river water bucket shower.
I leave my jeans in another bucket of water to soak all the chocolate mud out, and head to the "village" for lunch.
---
I pick up the Passavant, which is only valid for a week...
I quaff a pretty iffy lunch of rice with some some very gnarly cubes of mystery meat.
On the way out of the restaurant I make a friend.
He’s made a beeline at me in the hope that I speak English - because he does.
We have a chat.
As part of the small talk, I ask him what the people eat here in the village.
“Monkey”.
“*Monkey???* Okay... Right... Sure... *What else* do you eat?”
“Just monkey”.
Fuck. Monkey…
Jesus…
Cubes of god damn *monkey.* I prefered it when it was a mystery...
Anyway... Apparently, the road to Dolisie is “very, very bad” and it’s going to take eight hours to ride there, *at best*.
Great.
Fuckin. Great.
What scares me the most is that no one who ever gave me advice ever *over*-estimated the time taken for a ride; in my experience you can safely tack on a few extra hours to what anyone tells you... 
I reckon that I could do an eight-hour-plus slog if I was fresh, but I’m not.
What other option is there though?
---
Dinner is two oranges in the light of an old kerosene lamp in my shitbox.
Morale is at an all-time low.
I can feel myself choking up for the second time today.
I’m right on the edge of a complete burnout or breakdown or some other b word. I can feel it.
I’m in trouble. *I’m not ok.*
I’m so *alone*.
I'm lying on my bed. My floor is covered in mud (my fault), my room smells like a swamp (my fault), and the bed reeks of old sex (someone else’s fault). I'm lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, just so that I don't have to touch this pillow with anything except for the back of my head.
After a day like today I ought to be counting my blessings... Absolutely everything is working at the end of the day when it had no right to be.
I broke nothing.
I'm in a bed.
I have food.
I have money.
I don't *live* in this place. Seriously; not living here is enough of a blessing to put my life into perspective. I get to *leave*.
I seriously need to count my blessings and fix my attitude. No one and nothing else chooses my attitude but me...
I've been very "woe is me" of late, and that's *bullshit*. My life is incredible. Who gets to *do* this shit?
Not many, if any.
I'm healthy. I'm safe. All of the problems that I'm having start between the ears, and I'm the only one who can fix that up...
This is, actually, what it's all about. Well, what it was *supposed* to be about anyway; being tested. Embracing the grind.
The last 10k...
That’s what this is.
How do I respond?
Panic? Fear? Freak right the fuck out? Run home?
Or get on with it.
Africa was never meant to be easy; I never came here for easy.
Welcome to the challenge. Enjoy yourself.
Smile, ya wanker.
---
I snap awake to a demented rooster throwing the first salvo of the day’s shouting match.
Half my face and my open mouth are smeared up against my pillow that smells like someone’s done a lot of fucking *on* it.
Fucking delightful.
I check the time; it’s 3am. It's not even in the *ballpark* of dawn, but all the other roosters wake up and take up the chorus anyway.
Motherfuckers.
Good morning Congo.
---
A few hours of on and off sleep later I hear something scratching around in my room.
*Inside* my room. *Scratching*.
Whoever coined the phrase "as quiet as a mouse" didn't know what the fuck they were talking about.
Or is it a rat? It *sounds* big...
Do I do something about it?
No...
*Aaaargh* but what if it makes a little rat nest in my saddlebags and shits everywhere and eats everything?
What if it crawls into bed with me?
*Fuck it.*
Up I get and follow the noise with my flashlight over to the bathroom.
It’s a rat.
I interrupt it taking a bath. It's wringing wet. I'm not sure if that's from the toilet or from my water bucket...
When the light beam hits it it shits its pants. Freaks *right* out. It *bolts* for the drainage hole in the floor in a flash - and shoves its head into it.
No good. Won’t fit.
Not even close.
It pulls its head out of the hole and rams it in again, and again, and again, and again.
It won’t stop.
For the longest time it just keeps head banging the pipe while I just watch it, not sure what to do with myself; I haven't moved a muscle.
Finally it joins the dots that that idea ain’t gonna fly and changes tack, making a flying run at the toilet, launching *into* the bowl and it just disappears into god knows what awfulness...
Well... That was unexpected...
*What next?*
---
I’m as stiff as a board when the sun rises, and not in the customary way. I feel like death warmed up. *Rigor mortis*. I can hardly move I’m that sore. My muscles complain with the slightest movement.
I know that yesterday was tiring, but I’d no idea it was anything like *this* bad.
I feel like I've torn every muscle in my whole body from trying to lift The Shrike out of the bog yesterday.
To ride on today would be asking for trouble, both physically and mentally.
I’m not ready for it.
Physically I can't do *eight* hours more of yesterday; not on top of seven days straight in the saddle already, back to back to back...
Mentally I feel on the edge of something snapping. If I don't have a *perfect* riding day (and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't), I question my ability to handle it like an adult.
If anything were to go wrong, *anything*, I reckon I'd throw my toys and go sit in the corner to sulk.
But to stay here another night?
The thought of spending any more time here than absolutely necessary seems offensive to me.
To go or not to go. That is the question.
For now, all I have to do is go through the motions...
---
On the walk into the village the thought of food is making me nauseous.
I just *really* don't want to eat.
It's odd. Fair enough to be not hungry, but nauseous?
It makes me wonder if something's wrong with me.
I think I'm just really, really, *really* tired. It's nothing...
My musing walk is interrupted by something stabbing me right through the bottom of my toe like a shard of glass.
I hop around, let vent to a few *days* worth of pent up swearing. All the words. All the *best* ones. It comes out in a torrent.
Well?? "*What the fuck* was that??"
I gingerly pull my foot up where I can see it...
"Son-of-a *bitch*!!"
It’s a thorn, big bastard, the size of toothpick and as sharp as an ice pick. It’s gone clean through my thongs and *right into* my toe.
Yuck!
"Can I catch a fucking break??"
How the fuck does this even happen? Why are there spikes just randomly on the ground waiting for me to put my foot through it?
Fuck’s *sake*.
If my foot hadn’t of reflexively jerked itself in the air before my brain even knew what was going on it would have gone clean through my toe; the thing is needle sharp and metal hard. In one end and out the other. Nothing surer.
Lucky, again.
I think...
There's been too much "lucky" that's actually really fucking unlucky lately. I’m getting fucking sick of it.
My leg is probably going to fall off now; because of course it is; it's the Congo.
If I wasn’t convinced of buying something for those furious burst blisters on my feet I’m sure as shit convinced now.
Get me some alcohol...
---
Fuck riding today.
Fuck it.
Fuck. It.
After breakfast of an omelette I've killed the rest of the morning sleeping on a grubby couch at the "hotel".
I go eat another omelette for lunch.
I'm going to get scurvy.
Post-lunch I head back to the hotel with the resolve to do a little work on the bike, just to do something, *anything*, productive so that my day's not a complete wipe.
First item on the agenda - the air box.
I pop open the bike’s little built in "toolbox", where all the tools are kept, of course, and it dribbles out a weak little vomit of brown water.
I take out the tools and then unlock the lid of the metal box that protects the air box itself. Like a babushka doll. Only not.
Water comes dripping out.
A fair bit of water, actually...
*Fuck.* That's *definitely* not supposed to happen.
We're still ok; so long as the *inside* of the air box is dry we're ok...
Off comes the ice-cream tub air box on the engine side of the air filter.
"Oh... *FARK!!*"
It's got droplets of mud sprayed *all over* the inside, and what looks like baby diarrhoea pooled up in the bottom corner.
It's supposed to be *spotless*!
Off comes the air filter, quickly, aaaand, oh shit. Horrorshow.
It's absolutely *caked* in mud.
Half an inch thick *all over*.
*I had no idea...*
How did The Shrike even *start*? How did it move?? How did I not notice??
How the fuck did it not die?? 
Incredible.
Unbe-fucking-levable.
Shit - the electrics...
I hop around to the other side of the bike and pop open the electrics box.
It's *swimming*.
The water level’s stopped *just* under the fuses. Another centimetre and the electrics would have fried.
How did none of this get splashed yesterday with all the bouncing around?? Beats the shit out of me.
I leave all the compartments open to dry out and wash up the air box and filter with the river water. There's also dried mud through the front disk brake’s “cooling holes”, so I punch those out.
I try to get the baked mud out of all the exhausts nooks and crannies, and fail.
I oil the chain; it's muddy and rusty and isn’t one bit happy about it.
All the manual work has put the jam right back into my doughnut.
I’m feeling alive again.
Chompin at the bit to get on the bike and hit the road.
The appetite’s back, with a vengeance.
Let me at it. Let me at all of it!
---
Morning.
I want to stay...
Can you believe that? What the fuck is that? What a mad roller coaster. I can’t explain it.
But I *really* want to stay here now.
This place is the pits. The worst. I should leave. Plus, there’s no reason *not* to leave today.
I've river water bucket showered and hoovered yet another omelette; five down in thirty six hours. The Shrike is all back in one piece.
There's nothing else for it... gotta go.
---
Dolisie.
Rock bottom expectations are the best expectations to have; they're so very often succeeded.
The road was far, *far* better than the dire predictions and my imagination had dreamt up.
Rather than call the road difficult I would instead call it "irritating".
Less mud, more rocks. More potholes, more corrugations.
It wasn't difficult, just slow and uncomfortable.
There were some small villages on the road but with big, long distances between them. There was hardly anyone using the road at all.
Not exactly confidence inspiring...
The people aren’t particularly friendly anyway...
Coming from Gabon, where there was hardly a single shout from the side of the road - just big smiles and waving hands - to here, where it's less waves and more running, shouting, and making the international sign for “money” while they do.
Even the kids.
It feels tacky.
After lunch the whole thing opened up into a beautiful, stunning, deep-red dirt road.
The depth and vividness of the red was magnificent. Like I’m riding a road of paprika.
It was hands down the best quality red dirt that I’ve had on the trip. Especially after the shit that had been before it, it felt like paradise.
I smashed it at tarmac speed, spraying a rooster tail of paprika dust in my wake.
It was nice to feel the wind on the face again...
The surrounds looked like something out of Super-Mario: really weird green hills in the shape of upside-down cones, lots of them, just popping up out of nowhere.
After six hours - and not eight - I rolled onto tarmac.
The rest of the ride to Dolisie was a cakewalk.
At the crossroads to Dolisie it's ‘mac in all directions off to the vanishing point.
Fucking thrilled with that, because those are the roads I'll have to take when I leave Dolisie again.
At Dolisie I chance my arm at a local ATM and get a wad of cash back.
Everything’s coming up Milhouse.
And it’s about fucking time.
---
I kill a weekend.
It’s a dead town.
The hours are long.
I catch myself doing soul destroying internet trawling for *hours* after I’ve already finished what I went to the "cyber" to get done. When not doing that, I’m either sleeping or lying in my hotel bed doing nothing.
I'm waiting for Monday, because there's an Angolan Consulate on the outskirts of the village. I *have to* have a crack at it; it's only one country away...
---
Monday finally rolls around.
I’m armed to the teeth with papers.
I’ve even taken the liberty of pre-forging a “letter of invitation” and even a “permission letter” from the British Embassy in the capital, which apparently I'll need.
I’ve just typed up both letters - complete with official logos pinched off the interwebs - and printed them out. They actually look pretty legit.
I have to admit, impersonating an Embassy official feels very dodgy. Like, "I could get in real trouble for it" kind of dodgy.
I head to the Consulate.
I shake the hand of the security guard out front - who’s a friendly enough bloke.
He tells me to come back at three o’clock this afternoon...
"Por-qwar?". (Back to Portuguese for the Angolans)
Then he waves another bloke over, who I'm guessing works here, and he said to come back *tomorrow*.
Today’s no good.
In amongst the French I didn’t catch I pick up one word: "Fete."
I’m gonna guess that means it’s a public holiday today...
I take a long walk back to the hotel room.
More boring soul destroying?
Ok.
That’s the afternoon.
I skip dinner; I just don’t feel like it.
---
Well, skipping dinner was a hell of a premonition.
My early detection is *on point*.
Trying to get some shuteye and I’m as bloated as a Biafran and cramping up in the guts.
Badly.
Great. This again.
I’m nauseous and crook as a dog, but my body’s got no *ammo* to work with.
Nothing to fire out the ends.
Feeling crook isn’t even the worst of it.
Not even close.
That honour goes to the delirious, sweating, one foot in a dream and the other foot out of it that goes on for the entire night.
I can’t rest.
Can’t find peace.
The dreams are a mix of confused, unpleasant delirium. I hate it. I *fucking hate* it.
For reasons I don’t understand I’m always rolling onto my back and putting my arms above my head. It's not comfortable - and certainly not a position that I've ever fallen asleep from - but it's just what happens on instinct.
Time draws out.
I just want to rest.
---
I wake up feeling like ratshit.
I'm half out of my mind.
My brain jumps into the worst case scenario: Malaria.
It's not hard to believe - because I can't put my finger on another possible cause.
I’m not sure I can do the Consulate today - I feel like a zombie. Totally and crushingly exhausted, sapped of all energy.
But nailing this visa is too important. *Crucial*, in fact - without it I’m going to have to either ship out or fly out of Congo. I won't be able to go on.
So I can’t put it off any more.
I go through the motions and my demented brain throws up the word "passavant". I check my papers and, sure enough, the passavant for the Shrike runs out today. I'm glad that my sub-conscious is keeping a tab on this stuff, because I'm not...
I skip another breakfast - I'd rather be a zombie than nauseous.
Consulate first.
There's a rigmarole just to get into building, with two security guards both taking down all my details, and one of them even giving me a *metal detector*.
It's over the top.
I also have to leave my bag with the security guard.
Annoying.
I find the secretariat and her crony, introduce myself and explain that I'd like a transit visa. They speak French and a bit of English, so there's no problems understanding one another.
The Sec asks me where I’m from, I tell her England - a half truth.
She tells me to go and get the visa in England.
Fucking great. That old chestnut.
I laugh a nice, good natured laugh even though all I want to do is lie down flat somewhere and cry.
I explain my "mission" and the big trip and how going back to “old Blighty” for a visa isn’t really an option right now...
She considers all this with a bit too much scepticism, but asks to see my passport and a “letter of invitation” anyway.
Back on track.
I go back to my bag outside and fetch my bogus hotel booking and that forged letter from the British Consulate. For good measure I bring along my “letter of motivation/letter requesting a visa”, which is sometimes helpful. I’ve translated it into Portuguese, which I thought was a nice touch...
Cross your fingers.
She looks through all this crap and makes the observation that I'm going via the DRC.
I confirm it.
She fobs me off. Says that I can't get the visa here and I would have to get it in some place called Matadi, because the "system has changed".
Fuck.
Sounds like BS to me.
Time to scramble...
I tell her that the DRC is far too *dangerous*. It’s *unsafe*. So it’s a much better idea to get it here, where it's safe.
It falls on deaf ears. She says that I'll have to go to the Embassy in Brazzaville and plead my case there.
*Shit.*
This isn't going well.
As a last ditch hail Mary I say that I might *actually* go via Cabinda – which is a little, weird enclave of Angola’s on *this* side of the Congo River. Skipping DRC altogether.
I'm getting doughnuts... Can’t be done. Sorry.
I don’t have the energy to argue my case anymore, and my brain’s not crisp enough to be coming up with something clever to turn the tables.
With my brain hamster wheeling on the spot, a woman from another room comes in and has a chat with the woman I've been dealing with.
I catch a *tiny* snippet of it, it’s about *me* – she must’ve overheard from the other room – she’s saying something about Matadi being difficult. I’m straining to understand but it’s all too *quick*.
They finish their chat, and now I'm being asked for passport photos and my immunisation certificate...
Abra-fucking-cadabra! 
I reckon I've jagged it!
I supply everything they ask for, which isn't a whole lot, and get told to come back at one o’clock.
*Hallelujah!*
And, just like that, the final bureaucratic piece of the jigsaw falls into place. After this, there’s no more Embassies or Consulates. *Ever*.
In spite of the crushing exhaustion I could still tap-dance.
This is *huge*.
---
While I wait I head off to the Douanes.
They ask for 10,000 CFA just for an extension. More than twenty bucks... It doesn't cost half that much for an *original* passavant.
I tell them that it's way too expensive.
“Ce un camion?”
Is it a truck?? *What*?? What gave them the impression I'm driving a truck?
“Non... ce un moto...”
The price comes down by half. Weird...
---
I kill a bit of time doing nothing and then head back to the Consulate at one o’clock, sharp.
I get told to go away for another half hour.
I sit on the road out the front for half an hour, then head back in.
I’m told to come back tomorrow morning, at ten o'clock.
The Sec is telling me this while she's playing video games on her computer... Apparently, I’ve got to wait for “the chief” to sign the visa, whoever that is...
No worries. I don't give a fuck. I've got nothing but time.
---
Back at the Consulate with a headache and a guts ache. I've eaten nothing but three bananas in the last 24 hours.
I wish I could eat more, but, in my experience, if you put in a lot you’ll get a lot coming back out. With interest. Food rent.
It’s ten o’clock on the dot.
I get told to come back at one o'clock.
---
At one, I get told to come back tomorrow. At one o'clock.
I’m ready to crack it...
Why is this happening?
No one tells me what's going on.
If they took all my shit yesterday and said “come back in two days” that would have been fine. But the way it's being handled I'm not so sure of the result anymore.
Fuck. I've already chalked this up as a win...
Maybe they're *actually* giving my application a good looking at...
That would *not* be good...
It wouldn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out that there's been a lot of fraud going on. What could they do if they found out?
I hope it’s just that the Consular is too busy faffing about like everyone else here.
I’m torn between tearing them a new one - verbal vitriol - and not wanting to rock the boat...
I steam back to my hotel.
I'm sick of being in here.
---
Day three. One o'clock. Sharp.
I'm not rejected.
But it's the next worst thing; they want to send my application to Luanda - Angola’s capital - for "processing". It's going to take *fifteen* days.
I'm livid, and shattered.
I’m halfway between crying and venting my spleen. My heart slops into the bottom of my guts. I don’t have the energy for either.
Fifteen days kills it; I can’t do that. Firstly, because my Congo and other Congo visas will expire if I stay here for two weeks. Secondly, because even a modicum of scrutiny will reveal that my application is nothing but bullshit.
I tell her that that’s impossible for me, we need to do this now.
I get the equivalent of "too bad".
I beg. I grovel. I plead. I give up my dignity.
They won't budge. Fifteen days.
The secretariat says something to her crony, and they both have a little laugh. Some joke...
It dawns on me that they could have told me this *three days ago*.
I crack it. *Snap*.
They cop an *earful*. I don't even know what I'm saying... Something about incompetence and keeping me rotting in this shitheap of village and more and more and more. I don't know where I'm finding the energy, or the words. It's just rolling off the tongue in French.
I drop mic and walk off.
I'm fucked.
---
Here are my options as I see them.
One. Pull the ripcord. Always an option. Just *leave*. Go home.
Two. Go to this "Matadi" in DRC and cross my fingers. If that doesn’t work out then my options become very, very limited, and none of them are fun: Hell road, or ship out.
Three. Head to a place on the coast called Pointe Noire. Many things can happen there. I can go to the Cabinda border and have a crack there. Or I can go to the Angolan Consulate in Pointe Noire and apply for a visa, there. Or I can maybe ship out because it's on the coast.
Four. Actually wait the fifteen days for the visa. I hate this option. Especially after what’s just happened...
I'm not thrilled with any of this. My emotions are on a bit of a roller coaster ride. I go from being depressed and anxious to the point of *shaking* to being stupidly optimistic about my chances of jagging a visa in Matadi.
A fool’s hope.
What to do? All four options are equally rubbish.
Pick the least worst option and go with it. Whatever that is...
---
Fuck it.
Just get me out of Dolisie.
The Pointe Noire option would have ended in tears; if it didn't go *perfectly* I'd have only two or three days to cover six hundred clicks to get to the border with DRC before my visa expires...
I'm going with option two; Matadi in the DRC.
I know that's stupid. I *know*. But it feels like the least worst option.
It sounds crazy to even say that...

## Chapter Fourty Eight
The shutters open, and as the dreams fade away and the realisation sinks in of where I am - and what that means - it’s greeted with a dollop of dread and anxiety.
Right in the pit of my stomach.
Here it comes again; that little hell. That small terror of detaching from the familiar and going out into the unknown.
Today it’s stronger than usual. *Much stronger*. It makes me want to stay in my hovel, which I hate, and wait for help to come.
I get up and go through the motions like any other day. For lack of a better breakfast alternative I’m stuck with Chocopan and bread again.
Eating’s less like something I want to do and more like a mechanical ramming of the food into my face.
I feel like shit. Nauseated for no reason.
I know that this feeling is irrational - and extremely unconstructive - but instead of taking the time to change my outlook or attitude I just suppress it; it’ll change when I’m on the Shrike, the Shrike always changes everything.
I load up and wheel out. It's the first time The Shrike's seen the light of day in over a week.
The chain is absurdly loose. The word to describe it would be "flappy". By streets this is the loosest that it's been the entire trip.
It's absurd that I had an *entire week* of practically doing nothing to work on the bike, or at least give it a looking at, and I didn't bother.
For the whole week in Dolisie I can’t think of a single moment that I had any motivation to do anything, bike or otherwise.
I ponder fixing it up here and now.
No, fuck that, it'll be alright.
*I'm off.*
The only road that I’ve got on my GPS is the one that I’m going to take. It's a *humongous* detour, but my primary concern is not getting lost. And I've been told that the more direct roads are a crapshoot - a few hundred kilometres of scrubby goat track.
Bugger that.
As part of the detour I'll have to go through the “Pool Region” of the Congo.
I've been told it's *super* dodgy. The "Boko Region" within the Pool Region is even worse, I'll have to go through that too...
It'll no doubt be character building.
Hooray.
But, for now I've got four hundred kilometres of fresh tarmac to ride.
Be happy.
I hit the "N1" and it all rolls off me.
I feel better.
The sky is darkly overcast and looking pretty ominous on the eastern horizon, I'm making a beeline right at it...
There’s always something to stress about, right?
---
The tarmac road ends. It just *finishes*...
There’s a forced detour, it's signed “OLD N1” with an arrow off to the side. It's a shitty, dusty dirt track...
I can't...
---
Six hours.
*Covered* in dust, half blind and all brown. I roll into Loutete.
The tarmac was just a tease. Nothing more.
I spent about half the ride on well graded dirt - the foundations of the "NEW N1" - and the other half on the "OLD N1", which was a fucking *nightmare*.
*So* many trucks.
So narrow.
So much *dust*.
The road’s a goddamn moonscape. The base layer is hard, pointy, solid rock. Punctureville. Floating on top of the base is a thick layer of sediment with the lightness and fineness of talcum powder. I'm not exaggerating.
Big long haul trucks would come flying through at a stonking, breakneck speed and kick up a biblical amount of dust.
And getting stuck behind one... *Fuck.*
Imagine someone throwing gritty talcum powder right in your face - every moment - for six hours...
Shithouse.
Dangerous.
So much for a merry jaunt on the tarmac...
---
In Loutete the Shrike gets a half arsed service. She needs it.
I check the air box and I'm delighted there’s no dust on the inside.
That filter’s doing a bang up job.
All the bolts get tightened.
The chain gets re-tensioned. The links are all very loose and jingle. Can't be long now till that carks it...
I'm in the mood, so I decide to muck around with the clutch play. I jam an allen-key into the clutch pivot where it connects to the engine cover, just to keep it engaged while I remove the cable. The fucker lets go like a crossbow. The allen-key goes flying, lucky not to take out my eye...
Anyway, I replace the nut and grease the actual clutch handle, which has been squeaking. I notice that the cable at the clutch end has worn out a section of its conduit. Then I realise that in Accra I'd put it in all wrong; there's a sleeve that slots into another sleeve to hold the cable straight. This is why the cable wouldn't fit the first time... I fix it and now instead of the clutch motion feeling like shit, all heavy, hard and grungy, it's as smooth and as light as you like. I'm thrilled with the outcome and wish I'd picked up on it sooner. After that the chain gets an oiling and it's job done.
A good afternoons work and it makes me feel really good.
A real morale boost.
---
I’m still on that pendulum. On the roller coaster ride with my eyes shut.
All extremes. No peaceful middle.
I go from feeling like going for a jog to feeling like passing out.
Feeling vulnerable to feeling invincible.
Feeling like crying to grinning like an idiot in bliss.
Feeling rushed to feeling like I’m going too fast.
No stability, no level-headedness.
I know that it's all a choice, how I choose to think. How I choose my attitude.
And yet I just let my emotional state ying and yang where it wants like sheets in the wind.
---
Someone's banging on my door.
*Hard.*
Three times.
It’s dark, I’m naked on my bed, bolt upright.
The initial jolt passes. I'm *shitting* it.
I listen, keenly.
There’s *nothing* that anyone could *possibly* need out of me at this time of the night.
*Nothing*.
They knock again, even louder.
It’s either someone wants me to open the door so that they can do some form of violence to me, or someone wants me to open the door so that I can move my motorcycle or something trivial and stupid.
As far as I'm concerned, both of these people can get fucked.
They bang again...
I’m tempted to get up and give this person a piece of my mind, risky or not...
I hear them walk off.
I lie back down and try to get back to sleep.
Good luck with that...
---
I cog where I am and immediately the dread sets in.
It's becoming the status quo.
And I don't know why; I’ve *no* attachment to this place - I haven’t even been here for a single day yet. So why this feeling? It’s all out of place.
I go through the motions and get out of town.
I'd been told that the road to Mindouli is pretty shit, but that it comes good out the other side.
Here we go...
---
I hit Mindouli.
The "NEW N1" *disappears* completely. Only the "OLD N1" is left.
And it's even *worse* than yesterday, if that's even possible...
The intel couldn’t have been more wrong.
I’m *pissed*.
Furious.
It shits me to tears. This happens *all the time*; people won’t ever tell you that they don't know something if they don't know. Ever. They just can’t ever say “I don’t know”. I've never heard those words. Instead, they'll just take a guess and present it as fact.
This fucking road is a case in point.
You'd think I'd learn my lesson...
---
It gets worse, *again*.
Nothing's flat.
I'm on a constant bounce. All over the place.
Nothing but *constant* attention will suffice. To pick the right track is to bounce, to pick the wrong one is to bottom out the suspension with a *bang*.
If yesterday was like having a fistful of talcum powder thrown in your face every minute, this is like having a snow blower hose you down with the stuff. *Constantly.*
Like someone throwing a bucket of sand in a mulcher pointed at your face while you're trying to keep your eyes open or you might crash and break a fucking leg.
The thickness of the powder seems to have doubled. It's so thick that the tyres are starting to *slide* on it. Like riding on soap, even though it's completely dry. Unbelievable.
It puffs when I walk in it, and when I kick a pile of it it's like kicking air. Like being on the fucking moon!
The traffic's worse. Even *worse.*
Yesterday the majority of the traffic was coming toward me, so you'd get a quick flash of dust and after maybe ten or twenty seconds the slight cross-breeze would shift it off the road.
Today most of the traffic is going *in my direction*. There's no crosswind. Not a breath.
I'm spending half my time trying to pass trucks.
The plumes of dust are biblical, and hey go back forever. There's never any respite; no matter how far back you are from the next truck you're always in it's wake.
Trying to get around trucks is a goddamn *nightmare*. So *flaky*. I have to tailgate a truck while getting pumped full of powder, and then blindly overtake when I'm feeling lucky, squinting through the sepia tinted visor, trying to spot the oncoming truck before it kills you.
It’s terrifying.
At least twice I thought that "this is it"; life, over.
Each time the oncoming truck missed me by a few feet, spraying me with dust out the other end.
Whenever I’m not dicing with death I’m struggling constantly with tyre grip. I'm in a constant state of sliding around on this shit.
When I bury into a deep section of it, or accidentally put The Shrike onto any sort of sideways gradient I can't do much else other than cross my fingers; the tyres will do whatever the hell they want to do.
Over and over and over and over again I’m a fraction away from washing out the tyres and binning the bike. Every time I use the brakes I lock up the tyres and slide.
It’s impossible, tough, white knuckle riding.
After a few hours my throttle hand cramps and locks up from hanging on in a monkey grip.
*And there's still so far left to go...* We're not even close.
---
Somewhere along the line, the trucks thin out, and I’m left on the road all alone.
The talcum powder thins out too.
Instead of dust the air is choc-full of butterflies - more than I’ve seen anywhere on the trip – they’re *everywhere*, and they seem to say “it’s over, well done.”
I wonder if they've been there all along, and I haven't seen them because of the dust...
At this speed it's only little hits once every so often on the helmet.
I open my sepia tinted visor, and see colour again. I feel the wind on my face for the first time in a long time, and suddenly there’s peace.
It’s been a long time coming, and the day's almost over...
---
Something doesn’t *feel* quite right. I can’t put my finger on it...
No, something’s *definitely* up.
I duck my head around to inspect.
The rear tyre is just a little bit deflated...
Shit! *Nightmare!!* No no no fuck fuck fuck!!
Can I make it to Kinkala, the next stop? It’s *so* close. Only thirty clicks away.
If I make it there I can get help...
Damnit! Of course not, ya dickhead. You can't ride on a flat tyre for thirty clicks!
Shit!
So here it is, then, one of my nightmare scenarios that I mentally derange myself with while on the road (the puncture of the rear tyre and having a chain explosion are my current favourites).
I pull over.
*Here we go.*
I whip off all my hot riding gear; my first concern is sweating out; I've got no water left...
Second concern is the fact I've skipped lunch. Again. A poor choice.
My third concern is the actual tyre...
I'm full of nervous adrenaline. I can’t stay calm.
I inspect the tyre.
Sure enough there's a dirty great big flathead nail right in the middle of it.
That's a good start; because at least it's *obvious*. It'd be worse if I couldn't find the cause and just end up with the same problem a little further down the road. That'd be a disaster.
It's also good because it's not my fault; a more skilful rider couldn't have avoided it.
The sun's already got me sweating, it's mixing with the brown dust in my shirt to make mud.
I look around for shade.
Shade on the road here is *extremely* rare, yet there's a small patch in a ditch on the other side of the road where a small embankment has cast a tiny slither of shade.
It’s enough.
I roll the bike over with the rear tyre wallowing about and complaining.
I park it up in the ditch and get to work.
Step one, remove nail.
I can't get at it...
I haven’t even started yet and I can’t even do that; the nail’s all the way in and flush with the tyre. My pliers can't get a purchase on the bastard. They keep slipping off the head of the nail. Doesn’t matter where I try to grab it from, or how hard I squeeze, I can’t keep a hold of it, and the pliers slip and snap shut again and again and again.
It’s like a giant splinter, and the pliers are the tweezers. Like one of those hateful splinters you’ve got to go dig for, and end up butchering your skin to get to...
I use one finger to put downward pressure on the head of the pliers so that the bloody thing won't slip off, and squeeze like hell on the plier grips with the other hand.
The pliers slip off the nail and my finger gets crushed.
I *hear* the skin crunch.
"*Son-of-a-fucking-bitch-idiot! Fuck!*"
Moron! *How did I not see that coming?*
The top layer of skin didn’t break, but all the other layers did... The blood’s welling up and swelling into an enormous blood-blister.
I need to change tactics...
Out comes the screwdriver.
I wedge it under the head of the nail and it levers out. Easy. Shoulda done that the first time...
Moving on.
A car’s coming round the corner. I flag it down and ask the driver – via charades – if he’s got an air pump.
Nothing doing.
They point at a scooter coming the other way. I flag him down, and, yep, he’s got a pump.
You ripper.
My saviours as tatty and covered in dust as I am. His name is Albert.
Problem is though, he’s come too soon; there’s *a lot* of work to be done before I need a pump. It's literally the last thing I need to do... I’m conscious of wasting Albert’s time.
I *almost* tell him to keep going, and think better of it at the last moment. One scooter with a pump doesn't make a trend...
Ok. Here we go. I’ve never done this before... Cross your fingers...
First, I have to unscrew the rear brake pivot just so that I can get at the axle wheel nuts with the spanner.
It’s a pain in the arse.
The wheel and the exhaust get in the way of the spanner, so I can only give the nut a quarter turn at a time, there are a million turns to get through; the thread is as long as a pen.
I *know* the exhaust is molten hot, but I sizzle my forearm on it anyway. I hardly even notice it. Must be that adrenaline.
The fat, swollen blood blister on my finger explodes.
Lovely.
A small forever later and that simple job’s done.
Now, the wheelnut. I take off the "castle nut" using the special tool that came with the bike. It's just a glorified lock nut. The other wheel nut, the big one, requires the fat spanner, and that comes off too.
It’s then that I realise that, through some mechanical witchcraft, I didn't have to take off the big wheel nut... the axle would have slid right out with it still attached to the bike. Somehow... So that means that I didn’t have to take off that piece of shit brake pivot nut...
Albert must think I’m a retard.
What’s worse, with the big nut gone, all that’s holding the whole lot on now is the chain tension on the sprocket (the sprocket is the same thing on a bicycle; that spikey circle of metal that the chain goes on...).
Anyway. The whole thing could just fall apart.
Pretty thick by me. Not smart. Must be the adrenaline again... So many rookie errors.
Out slides the axle and out comes the whole wheel and tyre.
Albert comes alive.
I haven't asked him to, but I think that he's cogged I've got no idea what I'm doing, so he's put himself in the driving seat.
He can have it.
Albert chucks the wheel on the ground and stands on the tyre, doing a weird little crab walk around the perimeter. I don't know what this does exactly, but without exception, *everyone* I've seen change a tyre does this.
Go figure.
With Albert standing on the tyre we both start levering the tyre off the other end of the wheel rim with my pissy little tyre irons.
It starts out in a rush, making excellent, easy progress.
After levering off about a quarter of the tyre out of the rim it suddenly gets tight. The irons are bending under the strain. The metal sticks deform so easily, it’s impossible to get any leverage into the rubber without either ripping a strip out of it or warping the irons.
After a few minutes they wouldn’t look out of place in a packet of twisties...
Albert goes and grabs my wheel cam adjuster - a flimsy shard of metal - and uses that as a third pseudo tyre iron.
It actually works, but we're still not making much more progress.
I wonder if it's impossible with the tools we have... 
We - and when I say "we" I mean Albert – keep at it.
We try and try but we're at a point where the rubber just won’t come out any more.
It’s requires so much force, and yet it's so finicky.
It just won’t go, no matter what we try...
And then it goes. I've no idea how.
That was the crux, it seems, and the rest of the tyre gives little resistance.
Albert was sensational. He was the opposite of the the two blokes in Guinea who just forced everything; he was the one telling *me* to "du-semall", which means "be careful", I think...
Out comes the buggered tube and in goes the new one.
The two are *very* different. They *should* be the same.
The old one is much fatter than the new one, and the thickness of the rubber is like chalk and cheese. The old one is thick and the Chinese piece of shit replacement is thin like a balloon.
The *tyre* has 4.10 written on the tyre wall, but the replacement tube only has 3.00 written on it.
It’s not the same fatness...
I’ve bought the wrong spec...
*Shit.*
Nothing I can do about it.
All it has to do is last me thirty clicks, that’s all I need.
I feel an overwhelmingly urge to take a shit. In my squat position I very nearly shit my pants.
*Where the fuck did that come from??*
I *really* need to shit. *Right this second*.
It'd be rude to ask Albert to wait a moment while I go evacuate. Right?
So I clench.
And move. Fast.
I start levering the tyre back in place in a frenzy.
The start is easy, I levered in all but a quarter in a few seconds...
It tightens, again...
*Shit*. I don't have *time* for this...
It won't go.
We manhandle it but succeed in doing nothing other than warping the irons and shredding the rubber; the tyre won’t budge.
I'm sweating my ring off. Knackered.
And I’ve hardly done anything...
It goes. Again, I don't know how, but it pops into place. There's no knack...
I seize upon Alfred’s hand pump and go at the tyre with gusto.
It actually pressures up surprisingly quickly...
Pump pump pump pump...
I'm *dying* for a shit.
There’s a loud bang and the sound of leaking air.
I'm *fucked*.
*So* fucked.
Wait... It's *not* the tyre... it's the *pump* that's exploded!
The tyre is still losing air, quickly.
I pounce on the valve and unscrew it as fast as I can to keep as much air in the tyre as possible.
The valve comes off. Silence.
I give the tyre a squeeze.
I reckon there’s still enough to ride on.
Well, there’s going to have to be...
I chuck the wheel back onto the bike, axle in and tighten everything back up again.
Each turn of putting that brake nut back on again I'm *sure* I'm on the verge of making an unholy mess.
I ask Albert what he wants for the pump. He says 5k so I give him 10k. He puts his hands together to pray and gives me a humble bow. I guess he's happy with that deal then...
Between contractions I load up the bike again to fly to an appropriate location to get this thing out of me.
Or maybe I can make it to Kinkala...?
*Whoosh.*
On it comes in a rush.
I skid to an emergency stop and dive behind a shrub in one motion.
*Not a second too soon.*
Just another day in the office...
While I'm doing my thing I reflect: That, really, wasn’t so bad.
The punctured tyre, that is...
Another nightmare scenario put to bed.
Whenever I actually have to do something that scares me I always seem to come out the other side having lost my fear of it.
Punctured tyres, snapping a cable, being crook on a ride, getting stuck in the middle of nowhere, I know I can handle it. Once I know I can handle it, I stop worrying about it.
There's something to be said about taking on your fears...
---
Kinkala.
Pool region...
Small village, not much to do, but I *need* a day off.
It's the junk day that I had to have: repairing tyre tubes, washing clothes. Admin.
Despite being a non-riding-day I’m still filled with dread when I wake up. I can’t place it. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense why it’s there; there’s nothing to be scared of today...
It seems to wash off me as I take a bucket shower.
Talking to my host, he reckons that here all the way to Matadi is a total cakewalk. Lots of tarmac with a little bit of offroading in between. It’s too good to be true; which probably means it isn't. Once bitten twice cautious.
Much later in the day I realise that this is my three hundred and sixty fifth day abroad.
One year.
Probably the longest year of my life. Shit, getting on the plane feels like a whole different *lifetime*...
It doesn’t feel like an achievement, a year. Pretty arbitrary, really, and less of a milestone and more of a mental flag that it’s time to refresh the travel insurance, time to forge a new insurance certificate for the bike, and time to ask just what the heck happens in the UK after your motorcycle rego expires.
*Thrilling.*
What’s more interesting is dinner. They give me a questionable fish and rice in a convenient plastic shopping bag. They just slop it into the bottom of the bag... Take away: African style.

## Chapter Fourty Nine
Fade in. And I cog.
Border day. Boko day. Democratic Republic of Congo day.
Unknown. Unknown. Unknown.
And there’s no dread. No nerves. No hesitation. No fear.
It’s *weird*.
I feel *nothing*.
I just get up and get on with it.
I don’t think I’ve *ever* been this relaxed for a border day.
I can't figure it out.
Just like the dread of yesterday’s junk day, I can’t place the calm. It’s totally out of place, especially for a border as gnarly as this one. It's *Zaire* for fuck's sake.
Anyway. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth and all that...
I pack up and shape up and get going.
Kinkala’s not big enough to have any *legitimate* petrol, so I head to the bloke on the side of the road who’s selling jars of the stuff.
Grubby jars into a grubby funnel.
He's spilling fuel *everywhere*. All down my tank. Don't know what happens if it drips onto the engine...
I put in three bottle’s worth. However much that is...
The second bottle is full of shit and sediment at the bottom. Petrol shouldn’t have *chunky* stuff in it, I’m pretty sure...
I hit the road. And road it is. The intel was solid.
Tarmac all the way.
Wonderful.
It’s a one-and-a-bit lane road that twists and bobs its way through the gentle washed-out-green hills.
Very picturesque. No dust. No trucks. Just me and the Shrike.
I could get used to this...
We chomp the mileage.
It's delightfully easy and uninvolved. Chilled. I love it. I've missed it.
It's the first day of the entire trip that I've packed my wet weather gear way down the bottom of the bag.
So of course it rains...
Figures.
Luckily it doesn’t get too bad, but it's another lesson learned: don’t pre-empt *anything* here.
---
Boko.
It's a nothing village.
I have a little scratch around for an Immigration post; I have the feeling that this was going to be one of those posts that are nowhere near the border itself; still fifty clicks to go till I cross the line.
I don’t look too hard. Which is probably pretty thick, really.
I don't even ask anyone.
I ride on.
And *just* outside of Boko the tarmac disappears.
Vanishes.
Replaced by a very, *very* bad, hard rock path.
It's not a path of rocks, it's a path of *rock*. As in stone.
Singular.
The flat bits aren’t all that bad, but anything on a slant has had the rainwater gut fat channels out of the rock, leaving deep, eroded tranches all over the road.
We’re in the hills. Good luck finding something flat...
Even in a beast of a 4x4 this would be impassable.
I reckon I can do it on two wheels.
We grind our way on, bouncing all over the "road" in first gear, suspension moving like a jack in a box. It doesn't take long to realise that there's going to be nothing out here.
Not a damned thing.
This road couldn’t service the *smallest* of villages.
No chance.
---
I nearly bin it, over and over and over again.
In the space of hours I've seen two people on the path. *Two.*
They’re walking around with stuff on their head, as they will, but I’ll be buggered if I know where they’re coming from, or where they’re going.
The track has become so overgrown, crappy and remote that I’ve got to check my GPS to make sure that I haven’t somehow taken the wrong path.
Nope, this is the one.
I’m constantly worried that around the next corner the road is just going to say “nooooooope, sorry, you can’t keep going, impossible”, just like it did back in the mud.
Like a cliff or something.
---
Not far from the border and the track merges into a wide, beautifully graded dirt road.
*"Where the fuck did that come from??"*
The pleasantest of surprises.
These tracks are hands down my favourite to ride.
I *fly*.
Kicking up a huge plume of dust in my wake like a rocket ship.
It’s *glorious*. And the rolling gentle green hills make a gorgeous backdrop to the ride.
In a twinkling I'm at the Congo border post.
Time flies when you’re having fun...
I’m stoked to see them in their little tin shack.
I give them my passport, and it’s the easiest checkout of my life; they go fetch the stamp, asked if I have a photocopy of my passport, which I say I don’t (but I do), they say no worries, thwack some ink on my passport, have a nice day!
Not a *single* detail was written down, just all smiles and laughs and “who gives a fuck”.
Excellent. I wish more were like it.
I ask my new buddies about the condition of the road to the next village in DRC: Luozi. The answers is "bad". They reckon it will take four hours to get there.
They better not be underestimating that...
I peel out.
The good road disappears just as fast as it came.
Bummer...
I cross the “border” line - because my GPS says so.
There’s zero fanfare of any sort. No border post. Nothing.
I crack on.
---
The road is arguably worse than before.
It’s rough as guts.
I'm back to involuntary swearing in my helmet and wrestling with the Shrike for control as we bounce all over the place and try to avoid flipping off the edges into the trenches.
If I bin it in a trench it'll be - at best - a long walk to get help, probably with a broken bike. More likely will be a broken bike and a broken leg.
I'm not sure how that would end...
If I fuck something up out here I'm going to be waiting a long, *long* time for someone to walk by.
I haven’t seen a single other vehicle since all the way back in Boko. Not one.
---
After who knows how long of riding I finally come to my first village; a scattering of mud huts.
I ask around and, surprisingly, one of them is the DRC Immigration post. Excellent.
There are two blokes in plain clothes and another bloke who’s sitting outside, oblivious to any comings and goings. I think he’s locked onto the Shrike. It might be love.
It’s handshakes and smiles all round. I duck into the hut and we get to it.
They look at my passport and straightaway one of the blokes gets on the phone. I try to follow the French as best I can. The words "Britannique" and "Togo" pop up. He’s asking someone about my visa. He doesn't seem thrilled...
My guess is that they don't like that I've got the visa in Togo, because I'm not from Togo...
And it shits me. I applied for a visa, and I got one. These border mugs shouldn’t have *anything* to do with it; they shouldn’t have to re-validate and interrogate all the details that have already been checked at the Embassy.
I don’t need any of this.
He gets off the blower.
Sure enough he's saying something to me in French that includes the words “resident and Britainnique”. The words and body language are telling me the visa is no good.
Right. Buckle your seatbelts. This could get rough.
I explain that I'm a British citizen but a *Togo resident*. I *live in* Togo.
I get a look from both of them that says "Pah-leeze mate, don't bullshit a bullshitter".
He smugly asks for my Togo residency permit.
I'm ready for it. I pull my Togo residency permit out of my jacket pocket, unfold it, and hand it to him with a smug smile.
Stick *that* up your arse.
The two of them look at the permit, share a look, and then back at the permit, then at me.
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
Check. Mate.
They scrutinise the permit again, but all the details check out.
While they’re figuring out that curve ball, I improvise a story to try to make it all fit together, and I sell it with gusto: I’m an engineer working for an oil company in Lome, *where I live*. For this trip, I quit my job, flew to England, where I’m a citizen, and then did the whole trip - everything that you see in the passport - and *then* picked up the visa for DRC on the way through, *in my hometown* of Lome, Togo.
Not likely, and not particularly strong, but there’s no way to tell that it’s *not* true. At least not all the way out here in bumfuck nowhere.
They’re not swallowing it...
They’re more interested in the date that I picked up the residency permit: just two days before the visa was issued...
Well done, Sherlock.
Scramble time.
I explain that I never *needed* a residency permit while I lived in Togo. Why would I? The only time that I needed a residency permit for anything was when I tried to get the DRC visa at the embassy and they asked for one, so I got one. Right?
They’re not thrilled with this.
The bloke gets back on the blower again. I try to follow, but I'm not catching any of it.
He hangs up the phone and explains to me that that was the “chef”, which is French for "the boss", and that his chef needs to call *his* chef to get the green light.
Christ, how long’s *that* going to take??
---
We listen to the mice squeaking in the corners of the mud hut for an hour or so.
Now that I notice it, there’s mouse shit *everywhere*.
Lovely...
I’m starting to run low on patience.
In the purgatory we’ve talked mostly about the soccer. I’ve close to no interest in soccer, but I’m interested in it because every man, woman and child in Africa is interested in it; it's the best water cooler fodder I've got.
I slip into the conversation my plans for the future: Angola, Namibia, South Africa and then, of course, I'm going to ship everything back home to Togo.
I'm not sure if it's cementing my bullshit story, but it can't hurt.
I *need* to make this work now, even if it means taking a risk I wouldn't normally take: I ask them what more do they want from me, what more can I give them? How can I help move this along?
A thinly veiled offering of a bribe.
They take the bait; the bloke without the phone says kind of half-heartedly that I can give them 10 dollars for filling out details in their book.
I pounce on it and re-direct it. If I pay now I get the passport stamp now? Yes?
"Non."
Bummer.
Back to the wait.
---
The day is getting on...
What happens if this takes the *whole* of the day.
And what if I’m unceremoniously rejected? Then what?
I’ve no fucking clue. It’s never happened before.
I guess these guys aren’t above taking a bribe, so I guess it’s more of a question of how much it’s going cost me, if anything...
I hope...
While I’m checking the time and doing the math for how much longer they can keep me here at the post before I’m in the shit, the phone rings.
I strain to cog the conversation, or at least get the flavour...
*It’s a green light.*
Fucking ripper. The artful dodger strikes again!
Despite having done nothing to help me out the guys ask for that ten bucks anyway to stamp the passport. Sorry lads, that ship has sailed.
Unlucky!
I make up another story about how I don’t have any money, not a cent, and I ask where abouts I can find the closest bank to get some cash.
I'm so full of shit.
They stamp me out.
Hello, Democratic Republic of Congo.

## Chapter Fifty
Twenty clicks to Luozi and I go mad.
*Euphoric*.
Off my face.
Twenty clicks out. That means that whatever happens now I know that I can jog it in.
Might not be the most pleasant run, sure, but I know I can get it done without water or food.
I know I’ve made it.
I'm singing in my helmet like a madman as we bounce around the road, which has started to flatten out a bit, the rock's gone to light sand, and in small sections it’s glorious and quick.
And the urge to cry comes flooding out of nowhere.
I’m singing at the top of my lungs.
Screaming it!
This is what it's all about. I love this!
Why the hell do I want to go home after South Africa? Going home seems *insane* now. Why would I even *think* that? This feels *amazing*!! I could do this forever!! I’m going to do this forever.
Bring on South America!
---
Ten minutes of the divine vision and I bonk out.
Exhausted.
Tired. Hungry. Sore.
I take the risk without even really thinking about it and open the throttle a little and chance my arm, moving a lot quicker than I have a right to.
I’m still bouncing off everything, but it’s just a lot faster now. But it’s working out alright.
I *ying* when I should have *yanged* and go flying out of control into a hedge.
I get good and scratched up before I get things under control again and haul The Shrike back onto the road, wide eyed and paying fresh attention.
---
I pull into Luozi.
It’s a fair bit less than I was expecting.
Big enough to have proper buildings and some official looking stuff, but too small by a long way to have things like banks, a range of accommodation, or a good road coming out the other end of it...
After a fair bit of asking around and playing Marco Polo with the locals I find somewhere to stay.
It’s Spartan as fuck.
The room has nothing within the bare mud walls other than what looks like an army hospital bed from world war one, and a small writing desk.
It’ll do. And for six bucks, it’s really hard to complain.
I’m just happy to have somewhere to stay.
I really can’t be bothered doing anything, but my desire to be out of this room for as long as possible is stronger than my exhaustion. So I drag my arse out to go get shit done.
No one wants to trade money with me, so I get put over the barrel on the price.
Forty bucks worth of cash here in the local "Congolese Franc" is almost too much cash to hold in one hand. I feel like I'm in a burger commercial.
Forty bucks must be a king’s ransom here or something...
The notes are *filthy*.
I head to the Douanes.
One of their plebs asks for fifty bucks worth of francs to issue me a laissez-passer.
I tell him that it ain’t gonna happen and that the most I’ll pay is five bucks.
He gets on the blower to the chef, and then hands the phone to me.
*What the fuck does he think I'm going to do with this??*
I put the phone to my ear and say “allo?” and someone on the other end blasts two minutes of continuous vitriol into my ear.
I’ve no idea what he’s saying – it’s not even a conversation; all I can cog is that he well pissed off.
I think I’ve offended them somehow...
I hand the phone back while he's still yelling.
With nothing cleared up, and obviously making no headway on my five dollar offer, I just walk out.
---
Back to the Shrike.
I’ve been hanging on to a spare speedo cable for the one that I snapped way back in The Gambia.
Ever since it snapped I’ve had no idea what speed I’m going at, or how much distance I’ve covered. I just ride as fast as feels right, and take a break when I feel like it.
Honestly, I haven't missed it.
But, my GPS is telling me that I’ve done roughly ten thousand clicks between here and The Gambia. So now seems to be as obvious a point to replace it as any.
The light’s fading but I reckon I can still get it done.
It’s a pretty simple thing, a speedo cable, it’s like a long, thin spring that’s been wound up super tight. About the length of your arm. It’s bendy and flexible, so you can manoeuvre one end into what’s called an “assy”, or something like that, down by front wheel’s axle. The other end goes into a hole under the speedo, in behind the bike’s headlight.
I’m sitting on the dirt of the hotel’s courtyard, fucking with the cable.
It’s not fitting properly.
Doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t get both ends in.
It’s starting to give me the willies.
It’s tight quarters in the very busy headlamp space, full of shit and wires and cables and plugs. There’s no room for fingers. It's very fiddly. Fiddly when you need to be forceful makes for a maddening pain in the arse.
This was supposed to be an *easy* job.
Six lads step into the courtyard and come over to me. They start asking me inane questions.
I’m usually cool with this sort of thing, but right now I know I’m not handling this well.
I’m racking my brains to figure out what’s going on with this cable, the sun’s setting, I’m running out of time, I’m *frustrated*, tired - exhausted, even - and these blokes won't stop with their questions.
Like answering the questions of six irritating kids.
I'm trying to give the subtle hint that I'm a bit busy right now, and I'm happy for you guys to watch, but just let me work in peace. *Please*.
Nope. They’re not picking up what I’m putting down.
They go on and on and on. After half an hour I still haven't got this fucking cable in and they won't stop fucking pestering me; *I can’t deal*. But I think I've just figured out what's up: I need to rotate that “assy” around on the front axle to give myself a tiny bit more space, which is a bit more involved than it sounds, because the assy is locked in with the wheel’s axle nut, and that ain’t going anywhere...
Now the six are saying my last name. They’re *fascinated* with it. The way their saying it is giving me the shits.
A chorus of guys butchering my name, saying it over and over and over and over and...
I crack.
Snap.
I blow my top.
I lecture them like children.
The guys take huge big fistfuls of offence, and I feel awful straightaway.
Without another word they just walk off and leave, with me apologising profusely as they go.
Five minutes later the job’s finished.
I feel like an arsehole.
I head back to my hovel hospital bed. Things quickly go dark, and then something shits on my head...
That's karma for you.
---
Not much to do today.
I'm not sure if I could handle anything but a short day.
About a hundred clicks of dirt road out to the main highway and then another hundred clicks of tarmac to Matadi.
Come to think of it, this is going to be my last day of dirt for the rest of the trip. After today, it should be ‘mac all the way to Cape Town.
It makes me sad.
Like the end of an era.
I miss it already. I’m going to soak it up for all it’s worth today. Make the most of it. Savour every moment.
I head into the village to change money. On the way in, a guy comes up to me on the street to shake my hand, and then he just stands there, still, holding my hand.
I’ve let go of the shake, my hand's limp, but he won’t let go of my hand.
He looks a little crazy.
I walk off, thinking he’ll let go, but he doesn’t, so I’m dragging this crackpot along behind me.
After quite enough of that I forcefully shake my hand hard enough to get it back and walk on.
He won’t leave me alone.
I hate people like this. Hate them.
He follows me around ranting shit about who knows what to god knows who.
He follows me through the *whole fucking village*.
I try to shake him off, moving quickly through the narrow and busy markets, but I can’t lose the tail.
I’m not about to change money with this bloke following me around like a bad smell. I tell him - mostly with body language and with some broken yet forceful French - to fuck off, but he seems oblivious to it all. I don’t want to be any more forceful because I’m worried it’ll rub some people in the village the wrong way if it looks like I'm verbally lashing this bloke, and that’s the last thing that I want.
Bugger this.
I head back to the hotel.
He follows me all the way back to the goddamn courtyard. He must’ve tailed me for a good half hour at least. I feel like I’m being chased, harassed, friggin stalked. Feels bloody awful.
I tell him to wait (“attanday”) at the entrance to the open hotel courtyard and, thank god, he obeys, and I just leave him there.
As I go into my room I quickly turn my head to the entrance. He's still there.
---
I've been twiddling my thumbs for half an hour in my room.
I poke my head out of the door to see if he’s run out of patience.
He’s gone.
I head back into the village in the most roundabout and stealthy way I can imagine, and manage to get my money changed free of hassle.
Hoo-ray.
I change two hundred bucks worth.
If forty was enough to be a lot, then two hundred is enough to not look out of place in a gangsters briefcase.
It’s a shit-tonne o’ money.
Heading back to the hotel with my treasure trove, Mr I'm-Fucking-Crazy spots me and comes running over and gets right in my face.
Nup. None of this shit. Fuck that. My patience is out. Bugger rubbing people the wrong way.
I switch to English and tell him with forehead vein popping intensity that if he doesn’t fuck off I’m going to cave his fucking head in.
Does the job.
Some things just transcend language...
---
While I’m gearing up to get going some guy comes walking into my hotel room. He introduces himself as the 'Chef de Immigration'.
Ever heard of knocking, mate?
He’s wearing the African equivalent of a Hawaiian shirt and a silly Scottish golfers hat. Hardly threatening.
He wants me to stop by at Immigration to photocopy my passport and visa and residency permit on the way out.
Bugger that.
Why would I?
What’s in it for me? All that I’ve got to gain is a headache.
But then, if they catch me out while I’m trying to do a runner I might be in the shit.
And what if they tell someone down the line to keep an eye out for me when they realise I've skipped town. I don’t exactly blend in...
Alright, stuff it, I’ll go.
---
On the way to Immigration I grab four stodgy bottles worth of fuel. The bloke pours it through *a food strainer* and into my tank.
Righto...
The Immigration office is dimly lit, and the bloke manning it is a different guy. I sit down and we get to it.
I give him my papers, and I cop the *exact* same rigmarole from him that I copped from the blokes at the border.
*The visa is no good*.
We’ve been through this. I don’t need this again...
The two of us make the same circular arguments over and over and over again...
---
Somewhere in the vicinity of an hour has passed.
He's getting shitty.
He's not the only one...
The aggressive wanker starts filling out some sort of form that I never asked for, and then says "give me money".
*Fucking great...*
He tells me the form costs twenty dollars to fill in. I want to tell him to go fuck himself. Instead, I tell him I have no money.
It's a great card to play. What are they going to do? Deport me?
I pull a shitty 1000 CDF note out of my pocket – about a dollar’s worth - and tell him that this is *all the money that I have* until I can find a bank, knowing full well and good that there isn’t a bank in the village.
This is *all I have* for my lunch today.
This is bullshit. I mentally count my cash: I’ve got a fat wad of CDF’s in my other jean pocket, a king’s ransom in my inside jacket pocket, more money in my saddlebags outside, and [about seven hundred] U.S. dollars in my secret jacket pocket. I’m rollin’ deep.
He keeps me around for a long time talking to "the chef" on the phone.
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that there’s no one on the other end of the line, that he’s just having a conversation with himself...
I don’t think that he knows that *I* know the chef...
When he's off the phone I tell him to get the chef in the building, and then go ahead and give as precise a description of the chef as I can.
Suddenly, it’s “only a photocopy and no embarrassment”. I can leave.
Is he shitting me?
I’m happy and pissed off and confused all at once.
Whatever.
I jump on the Shrike. It won’t start...
It makes noises like an old car trying to fire, but it won’t turn over.
*What the fuck?*
What’s that supposed to mean?
I give it another go and it boots on the fifth or sixth turn, and blows a big plume of black smoke out its arse.
Sounds crook...
There are misfires everywhere. The Shrike's unhappy, and so am I.
Air filter?
Dunno.
We make it to the other end of the village, and we're stopped by The Congo River.
I thought it was going to be big, but I didn’t think it would be *this* big.
It's *immense.*
The other riverbank is so far away that it’s shrouded out almost completely by the humid fog.
It's as still as a lake...
I sit and take in the view while I wait for the barge to get going.
---
An hour and a half later and it's finally time to start loading up the barge.
It's past lunchtime by the time we get to the other side of the river.
The Shrike won't start. Again.
Eventually it turns over enough and blows black out the back.
It's really not happy.
I can tell that if I roll off the throttle to let it idle it'll conk out.
It's *suffering*.
I roll off the throttle.
The Shrike gives a few coughs and bangs and then dies...
*Yuck.*
Probably that fuel, right? That shitty fuel?
What if it dies on the ride?
It chews my head as I chew a banana.
I hit the ignition again and when it finally fires I don't waste any time. We're off.
I'm not going to take a break for the rest of the day if I can help it; the last thing that I want to do is to turn off the bike in the middle of nowhere only for it to refuse to start again.
So, that’s going to be - minimum - three hours. Probably more.
I’m not sure if I can do it.
That's a *long* time in the saddle. That'd even be a long time to sit on a couch.
It’s really hot and *really* humid.
I’m already sore from the last week and last night’s hospital bed.
I'm already tired.
But what else can I do?
The marathon begins.
The road is practically the same as the one on the north side of the river, if not a little easier. There’s still hardly any people, traffic or villages. Nothing really.
It’s going to be a lonely ride.
---
My arse is already telling me I need a break, and my throat is telling me I could really use a drink. It's only been about an hour. I ignore it.
I'm bouncing up a hill, and I can sense...
What *is* that?..
Something’s not quite right...
Something...
I go cold all over.
I lean my body over and take a look at what’s going on; but I already know.
The back tyre’s got no air in it.
None.
Empty.
It’s rolling and lolling and flapping away noisily.
No. no no no no no no no no no no no no...
I *swoon*.
Oh shit fuck no! Not again! Not *here*...
I pull up, and the Shrike coughs and splutters to death by itself.
Silence.
I’m not sure I can deal with this...
But. Well. I’ve got to. No choices. Get on with it.
I know this should be an easy job.
I know it, alright? It's ok...
It’s just a tube change, it’s not rocket science, no big deal, right?
Well, yeah. But no.
Get started.
The tyre is *hot* to touch. Jerk-your-hand-away hot. *Not* a good sign. Must’ve been riding on it for a long time for it to get that angry.
Hope I haven’t fucked the tyre and the tube... If the tyre's fucked then I'm *definitely* fucked.
*“Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.”*
I look for signs of a puncture culprit, but find none.
No dirty big nail this time.
I take a quick squiz at my GPS.
It looks like I’m almost perfectly stuck in between where I came from and the next village along; fifty kilometres forward, fifty kilometres backwards. And nothing in between.
Figures...
So, it’s up to me then.
Well, no it’s not. If it’s up to just me then I’m a dead man; I need someone with an air pump.
*Shit.*
I do a quick stock-take of supplies. I’ve got a banana that I picked up on the boat, and a bottle of water.
I ain’t gonna be jogging it in. Not *fifty* clicks.
Well, maybe... I *have* done a fifty clicker before. But that sucked. Hard. And was under *much* better conditions. *I* was in much better condition... And it wasn't ripping hot and reeking humid.
So, *no*. Nothing left to do but to cross my fingers and hope that someone eventually comes along. Other than that, I might as well get to work and do what I can.
I wheel the bike around to face downhill so the bike will tip forward on the stand and let me work freely on the rear wheel.
I’m sweating before I’ve even taken my shit off the back.
My clothes are already starting to soak through in the dead air.
The sound of a motor cuts through the silence...
I stop everything and prick my ears up. It's a long way off...
I wait.
Sure enough, a big 4x4 comes rumbling past.
*Bizarre*.
He must’ve been up my arse this whole time, ever since the barge.
The vehicle is packed with humans. I mean *packed*.
Swimming with them. I can’t even do a headcount... Must be pretty fucking uncomfortable in there in this heat and humidity and all the bouncing around...
It’s obvious that the driver’s keen to move on. But I manage to hold him up for long enough to explain that I’ve got a puncture and no pump.
He has a pump.
*Hallelujah*.
He’s not going to stay to help me, he needs to leave now.
Despair. I'm crushed. I don't know if I'll get this chance again... I beg him to stay for just a little bit.
He can't. But he will sell it to me instead for twenty bucks.
Deal. Fucking deal.
That’s a great deal for him and a fucking saviour for me.
Deal, deal, deal!
Merci et au revoir, mon ami!
The noise of the 4by fades, and now it really is all on me.
I can do it.
Out comes the wheel, which is less of rigmarole after learning my lessons a few days ago.
It's not arduous, but the sweat is already dripping off the end of my nose like a leaky tap.
Shit.
I take a drink.
This bottle isn't going to last...
Time for the real work; getting that fucking tyre out of the rim again.
Even with four hands and three irons I wasn’t sure we were going to get it last time.
I don’t like my chances...
But, then, it *has* to work. I have to make it work.
The first three quarters of the tyre come out easily, but just like before it tightens for the last quarter, and won’t move.
No matter what I do it won't lever out. Exactly the same as last time. It’s too tight. The bastard thing is designed to stay in that rim, and that’s exactly what it wants to do.
Anything I lever out just slides right back into the rim again.
It’s so *tricky*!
If I try to go further in to get at a bigger section of the tyre I just end up pulling so hard that I bend the metal. The tyre won’t budge a fucking millimetre.
It’s hard, frustrating work.
Not frustrating; *Infuriating*. That’s what it is. I want to take the wheel and hammerthrow it into the bushes.
There’s no outsmarting this.
I want to give up. But it's not an option.
Sweat is drumming onto the tyre with a steady “doonk, doonk, doonk…” like a metronome.
I’m going to snap.
---
I give up.
I need a break.
I go check my GPS for the time. I've been at it for something close to an hour...
*I can’t do it*.
I feel like I’m just pushing shit uphill. Smashing my head on a wall.
My hands are blistered and filthy.
Half the bottle of water is gone. My throat is tight with thirst. It's biting at the back of my mouth, but I don't dare take a drink.
If another car ever comes by I’m going to get in.
Leave everything.
But what if a car doesn’t come?
When do I start walking?
Nah. It has to work. I’ve *seen* it done.
*It has to work*.
I get back onto the levers.
I’m shredding up the tyre wall now. It doesn’t really matter if I ruin the tyre if I can’t get the tube out anyway. But, then again, there's no point in replacing the tube if I've destroyed the tyre.
Fuck it.
*"Fuck you!!"*
I carve the fucker up.
I carve and carve and it's a mess.
The bastard pops out.
*Thank fucking Christ*.
I sit on the dirt floor and catch my breath and flex my fingers.
I can see the wires or canvas or whatever that is that’s under the rubber on the tyre. *That can’t be good...*
Out comes the shitty busted Chinese tube.
I pump it up and give it a good looking over. But I can’t find the puncture. It should be hissing air at me from *somewhere*.
It must be tiny.
I look and look and look. It’s important. I *have to* find it. If I can find where the puncture is on the tube, that'll give me a ballpark area to look at on the tyre for the cause...
Nothing doing.
*Nothing*. The tube is losing air but I can’t find where. I need water so that I can look for bubbles.
But that ain’t gonna happen. I ain’t even going to spit on it.
Bugger it.
Get on with it.
I tuck my old and re-patched tube into the tyre like tucking in a blanket.
Even this has to be tricky.
The prick of a thing is too fat to fit in between the rubber and the rim.
It won’t slide in easy. I know I shouldn't, but I have to force it.
It goes.
Now, damn it, I’ve got to lever the tyre *back* into the rim.
I step on the tyre, just like Alfred did, and half of it pops neatly into the rim.
Good.
At the three quarters in mark my feet and weight can do no more.
Tyre iron time.
Again, it’s fucking impossible.
Once I reach “the crux” - that last quarter - I just can’t make *any* progress. The tyre refuses to obey, and obstinately bends the crap out of these pissy god damn mother fucker tyre irons.
And it's even more risky than before, because now there’s a thin tube on the inside that if I accidentally catch between the tyre iron and the rim... well, I don’t even want to think about that...
Point being, the job requires a huge amount of force, and I’ve got to, somehow, be delicate at the same time.
Time passes. I work.
---
No progress.
None.
I’m gutted.
Spent.
Covered, saturated, in sweat – sweat that I’m not replacing.
It keeps rolling into my eyes, stinging, and I can't wipe my eyes because of my filthy hands, covered in grease and dirt and blisters.
Thirsty. Tired. Scared.
The blisters on my hands explode.
There’s flappy bits of stinging skin all over my hands, weeping whatever that is that blisters have. The blister fluid collects the red dirt off the ground, and the road grime off the tyres.
The crushed thumb from a few days back has peeled right open.
I’m in trouble.
I can feel myself crapping out.
My brain is slowing. I'm running out of kilojoules.
The tyre pops in.
I don't know how, but it gets past the impossible limit, and the rest of the tyre happily pops in, easy as you like.
We’re done.
I don't have anything left to even be happy.
*Get me out of here.*
I get out the air pump and work away at the plunger.
The tyre inflates quickly, and before long it passes my thumb-squeeze pressure-test.
I unscrew the pump off the valve as fast as I can; air hisses and escapes through the valve while it’s still attached.
The valve comes off.
But, there's still a little noise...
What *is* that??
I stick my ear onto the tyre...
I can hear a tiny, *barely* audible hiss.
Oh no...
*No*...
No no no no no no no no! Oh *fuck no*!
I'm fucked.
*Fucked!*
I’m going to cry.
My grubby face collapses into my grubby, mauled, hands.
All that for nothing.
No more options. No more spares.
Nothing.
Fuck the bike. Fuck my stuff. I’m in trouble here.
I need to get out.
I’ll be lucky to have another car, and even luckier if that’s not swimming with people like the last one...
I’m no chance to bring my shit with me. It will all have to stay here.
Everything I own. Everything. On the side of a road. In the Democratic Republic of Congo. Overnight. Probably.
What chance do I give that?
50/50?
*Worse?*
What to do...
I can’t move the Shrike into the bushes to hide it – it’s missing a wheel... – so I lock the steering, lock my chain on the front wheel. And that's all I can do...
I chuck all my shit deep into the roadside scrub *precisely* twenty strides away from where I've parked the bike.
I mark a waypoint on the GPS, and call it “EVERYTHING”. 
That’s all I can do.
Time to wait.
And pray.
---
How did it come to this...?
*What am I doing here??*
---
That’s a motor!
Is it…?
Yes! *Definitely* a motor. Coming from the direction I was headed in.
I don't know how long I've been waiting...
A 4x4 comes around the corner.
It’s jam fucking packed. It looks even busier than the other one. This one’s even got blokes hanging off the sides and some mad bastard sitting on the top.
The driver stops for me.
He looks like he’s never cracked a smile once in his whole miserable fucking life.
It’s pretty obvious what my problem is; one look at the Shrike tells the whole story. I get straight to business (I'll save you the French...).
Do you have a puncture kit?
Non.
Can I come with you?
Non.
Fuck. I *have to* go with him...
I’m looking down at the ground while I think of what to do next, and I cog that *his* tyre is deflating.
Fast.
*Pissing* air.
Ha! What are the odds?! There’s karma for ya, jerk!
I point it out to him and I’m on the verge of going full, delirious, cackling maniac on him.
I don't think he appreciates my outward happiness at his misfortune, but it’s *hysterical*.
Misery loves company, and now all of you are stuck with me! Suck eggs!
The “hangers on” on the side of the car launch into action.
They switch out the tyre for the spare with the efficiency of a race car pit crew.
This mob have played knifey spoony before...
And they’re gone.
They just drive off.
---
My imagination gets vivid.
All the bad outcomes.
It’s driving me nuts. But there’s nothing left to think about.
I sauté my nerves in a rolling simmer.
It's a slow cook.
Even though I’m not moving. I’m still sweating.
The water's gone...
I *need* to get out of here.
Another sound. Is it..??
Yes!
This one’s big.
Real big.
Gotta be a truck...
It’s a fucking truck!
How is that even *possible* on this road??
Doesn’t matter, it’s *perfect*.
Everything can come with me!
Thank *Christ*.
Perfect perfect perfect!
Deliverance!
I wave him down.
He pull’s alongside me. But he doesn’t stop.
Why isn’t he stopping??
The truck keeps rolling slowly on. I half-trot to keep up.
He's not stopping!!
I’m waving, shouting, pleading, begging, running alongside. But the truck starts making more noise, and slowly pulls away.
"Fucking *mug*!!"
---
I can’t do this anymore. I can feel the snap coming on.
What happens then?
A meltdown in Congo? And after that?
No one knows I’m here. There’s no one who will help me. No one who can save me.
*No one’s going to save you, no one’s going to save you, no one’s going to save you...*
Another sound.
Definitely.
Small. *Whiney*.
A scooter comes around the corner this time.
Useless; it's got three blokes on it...
It’s already violating the laws of physics.
If that wasn’t enough, there are wooden crates stacked up high enough to be a fourth man on the back.
They pull up alongside me, and take the chance to have a break.
I dejectedly explain the situation to the driver while he hoses one out into the scrub.
I’m about to ask him if he could send me some help when he gets to the next village, but he beats me to the punch; he says that he’ll help me.
I can’t see how...
He says he’ll take my wheel to the next village, have it repaired, and then bring it back to me ... for ten dollars...
*I don’t have to do another tube change...*
Deal! Deal deal deal deal!
That’s a deal!!
My friggin *saviour*.
It's weird. I'm mostly thrilled that someone's taking care of the repair for me, rather than being saved.
Weird...
Anyway. My personal Jesus wants the money now, *before* he leaves.
I reckon that’d leave him with very little incentive to do what he said he would do... Something tells me that he’s not doing me this favour out of the goodness of his heart...
The only thing worse than the current situation would be the current situation minus a stolen wheel, minus ten bucks, and in the dark.
I convince him it’s better for both of us if I give him the money once he comes back.
It's a deal.
The two other blokes are trying to strap the wheel to the top of the leaning pile of wood crates with a couple of rubber straps.
They’re struggling.
It slowly dawns on all of us that it’s a bridge too far, it ain’t gonna fly. There’s nowhere else it can go...
Despair.
Just when there was hope, it’s snuffed out again.
I'm sure that this is my last chance. It's too late in the day for more traffic.
I’m about to ask him, again, if he can send me help from the next village, when he pulls a *brand new* tyre tube from out of the bike somewhere, like a goddamn magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
It’s an 18 inch tube, which is *exactly* my size.
*Is this real life??*
Twenty dollars.
I make that fucking deal!
He’s stoked, I’m saved. Everyone’s happy.
Then it dawns on me; I'll have to change the tube... Again.
I look at the tube in my hands, terrified.
I don’t know if I can do it...
I feel so *weak*. Crushed.
I’m not sure I can do it again with these mangled hands, and with the added pressure of knowing that this - probably - is my last shot.
Jesus and his disciples ride off, and leave me to it.
Nothing’s changed from the first time. There’s no knack that I’ve learned. No tricks.
Here we go...
---
It won't go.
Everything’s taken to shaking now.
I’m not sure what’s causing it; the exhaustion; the dehydration; the fear; or the crushing nervousness.
I can't stop it, so I've stopped paying attention to it.
The tyre pops out.
I collapse.
---
The old tube’s too fat and won’t come out.
My patience ran out hours ago; I manhandle the bastard out of there.
Rough as. 
Right. This is it. This is the *last* chance. Botch this and it’ll kill me.
I’m *terrified*.
I handle the new tube like it’s made of tissue paper. I feel like I should be wearing white felt gloves.
Gingerly, delicately, I tuck it into the tyre.
No force. I make sure that it's positioned *perfectly*.
It’s tyre iron time.
*God help me...*
It doesn’t matter how long it takes; I *can not* pinch this tube. If I fuck it up I’ll be waiting around a few hours anyway.
Or all night...
---
There is no doing this gently.
It's just *not* possible.
The bastard of a thing is either going in with force, or not at all.
Fuck it.
Roll the dice.
Tyre wall: shredded.
Hands: beyond.
Nerves: shot.
Tyre: ... *In.*
It's in.
It's done...
I screw on the pump and I’m ready to cry.
I can’t deal with this not working. I’m welling up anyway...
What a fucking mess.
The tube takes the air. The tyre inflates.
It passes squeeze test.
Or does it?
Not enough air and I’ll get a pinch puncture on these rocks. Too much air and I’ll blow the tube right here, right now...
I don’t know... I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know...
Off comes the valve to a rush of air.
Then silence.
I’m going to cry anyway...
I need to go, right *now*.
---
I’m all at sea as I reassemble the bike
*Swooning*.
I’m out of my mind, my body’s really giving it up now.
I know this feeling; out of kilojoules, out of water.
I walk three trips back and forth the twenty strides to "EVERYTHING".
Load up.
I check the pressure with a squeeze and it seems to be the same.
Ok.
Now, the Shrike.
Please. *Please*. I need this.
I turn the key and wait for the fuel pump to finish its little whine.
*Please* start.
*Please.*
I hit the ignition button.
It turns past where it would normally fire.
Keeps turning again and again. *Shit.*
Turning, turning, *coughing*, *coughing…*.
*Please!!*
The Shrike roars to life.
Angry.
Misfires everywhere.
Black flying out the exhaust.
Sounds fucking terrible. Running like a dog.
But running.
It’ll do...
I jump on without taking my hand off the throttle, stomp down into first, drop the clutch, and we’re away.
We’re away, but I’m a mess.
I can't stop *shaking*.
I'm dragging the whole day along with me.
My nerves are shot to hell. I don’t want to play this game anymore.
---
*"NO!"*
No no no no no no no!! *Oh my god.* I *can't!!*
The Shrike is wallowing around; same feeling as the last two times.
I pull over and get off the bike, I keep my hand lightly on the throttle in neutral gear to stop the motor cutting out.
The back tyre isn’t totally flat, but it’s definitely *squashed*
Puncture? Or underdone?
It doesn’t matter. It’s irrelevant.
Only option is to put more air into it and crack on and see what happens.
I take my hand off the throttle, it stays in idle, somehow doesn't die.
The tyre gets a boost.
We ride on.
---
*Everything* is scaring me.
*Every* movement. *Every* wiggle. *Every* noise. *Every, single, time*. I panic.
*Panic!*
I check the tyres.
I panic and panic and panic...
Up pops a village.
*Out of nowhere*.
It’s small, but big enough to have a shop. Selling bottled water.
It's going to be ok.
*It's actually going to be ok.*
---
Water's never tasted so good.
I ask around about a place to stay the night. They have one.
I follow the directions, and then get shown my room.
The bed is covered in little morsels of mouse shit.
Thank god.
I’ll take it.
Stress rolls off me. At least some of it.
It’s going to be ok... I’ll be ok....
I unload the Shrike into the mouse nest, head out the front of the “hotel” and fall into a plastic chair.
Fade to black.
---
*Neck!?*
Aaaaargh! *Jesus*! What’s happened?? My fucking neck!!
I open my eyes and see a crowd of faces staring back at me.
*What the... fuck?*
I squint and blink out my eyes and try to straighten my neck. Won’t happen.
Where *am* I?
The last year comes rushing back to me.
Oh. Right... *Damnit.*
My muscles remind me of the day before my brain can bring it up.
*I don’t remember falling asleep...*
I feel even *worse*, my neck’s *fucked*.
Looks like half the bloody village has shown up to have a look.
Not too close though...
They all look pretty cagey.
Like I'm a stray dog.
I give a half smile and a half wave. I’m not in the mood for this...
I need to eat something.
I’m up, nearly everyone leaves.
Did they think I was dead? Ha! I reckon they might have...
I must look like *shit*.
I'm surprised I didn’t wake up to someone poking me with a stick...
---
I can’t believe I’m here, and with all my stuff.
By rights I should still be back there on the road instead of hoovering this delicious huge plate of rice and beans.
I’m shoving the stuff into my cheeks like a chipmunk, trying to chew and swallow and breathe and talk to my new buddies all at once.
I nearly cough a huge gobful over everyone when I accidentally ram something down my windpipe.
I put away a plate of food the size of a wheelhub in what must be a record time.
I wonder if these guys think that this is normal...
They’re a pleasant enough bunch.
One off them introduces himself as “Papi”. He clears landmines for the Red Cross.
There are landmines, are there? Ah. Righto. *Noted...*
I tell him about my fun introduction to DRC and he says he’ll patch up my two busted tubes for me.
Legend!
While we’re working on that he says that he wants to ride “ensemble” with me tomorrow into Matadi.
*Fuck yes*.
Papi you hero.
This is *exactly* what I need: A wingman.
We get straight to patching the two old tubes.
It looks like I “pinch punctured” the first tube I popped, because the hole was on the rim side, not the tyre side.
The other one I must’ve buggered with the tyre irons because the hole is somewhere near where the rim and the tyre would probably meet.
No surprises there.
Papi and I are nearly done with patching the tubes when a bloke rocks up to the village on a scramble bike with a punctured rear tyre. He looks like he's been riding on it totally deflated.
Papi and I check it out. It’s exactly the same brand and model and spec as my tyre.
*Identical*.
How is that possible??
It looks like we'll be doing a *third* tyre change today.
And when I say we, I mean them. I’ll sit this one out, thank you very much.
Papi goes and fetches his tyre irons.
Tyre irons as long as your arm...
They whip the back wheel off the bike quickly and efficiently, and then Papi peels the tyre off the rim with comical ease.
Foomp. Foomp. Foomp. Foomp... Pop!
Done. *Unbelievable.*
He did in *twenty seconds* what took me *three thousand six hundred seconds*.
No sweat...
I want to cry.
Papi takes one look at my face and laughs his head off. He thinks it’s hilarious.
*That’s* what a tyre change should look like: non-life-threatening.
I *must* get a pair of those tyre irons.
Papi whips out the tube, finds the hole, patches it, puts it back in the tyre, stomps three quarters of the tyre back into the rim with his feet, and peels the rest into the rim in a *single* go.
Job: Done.
No big deal.
I look down at my fucked up hands, touch the swollen and bruised knees from having knelt on the hard rocks for *hours*.
Schools out. I've learnt my lesson.

## Chapter Fifty One
The roosters start their shouting match.
The world is still pitch. Whatever is up there in the roof finishes off it’s particularly industrious night. I'm guessing it's the same thing that was shitting on my bed.
I’m up.
Still knackered. But I can’t sit still.
Today’s the day; the last day of dirt.
*Ever*.
I’m bursting with nervousness.
Even in convoy mode with Papi, I’m still not ok with this.
The idea of another puncture, or something going wrong on the bike, or that donkey piss petrol conking the Shrike out makes me squirm.
I’m not sure that I have the reserves to be able to deal. We’ll see...
Today’s my first "real" day in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The first taste of what the place is really like.
It’s not something that I've been looking forward to.
*At all.*
The Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, formerly just plain Congo.
It's probably the most fucked up place in all of Africa.
And that’s saying something...
Maybe the most fucked up place in the whole world. It’s got to *at least* make the shortlist.
The wars they had here are the biggest wars you’ve never heard of. The biggest wars I’ve never heard of anyway.
They weren’t that long ago; they were in my lifetime.
I never remember seeing it on the news, probably because it had nothing to do with anyone I know. So, naturally, no one I know gives a flying fuck; hooray for humans.
But I’m here now. So, yeah, I do give a flying fuck.
It was *bad*.
It was so bad that people – what people I’m not too sure – but people call it *World War Three*. Seems a poor choice, given that the rest of the world didn’t really want anything to do with it.
But yeah, that bad.
And *super* rapey.
That’s about as eloquent as I think my brain can go this morning; super rapey.
War crimes.
Crimes against humanity stuff.
While the whole country was going to hell in a handbasket, the president - a bloke who renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko Koko Ngbendu wa za Banga, which means "the all-powerful warrior who (I shit you not...) because of endurance and an inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake(!)" – was using all the country's money to fly chartered trips to Paris on the Concorde.
*The* Concorde.
The supersonic one. *That* one. Flown to Paris. From his private, enormous palace in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Congo.
*Just him*.
Him, and the national youth choir...
Seriously, you can’t make this shit up.
What I can’t believe is that Air France was totally cool with it...
Anyway. The country was a total clusterfizzer, a basket case, a deadset mess, and then it *exploded*.
Things turned horrifically, *brutally* violent.
I don’t really want to think about it...
It's the Belgian's fault. Who would have thought? They ruined this place and then left it with nothing. Look it up. It's bananas.
---
I'm not the only one walking around in the shadows of the village on the edge of dawn.
Breakfast is two deep-fried doughballs. It’s all I can find.
I go back to the hotel, take a bucket shower in a basin where the ceiling is only half as tall as I am, and the concrete walls are covered in a slimy, wet growth. There's no light.
It's hard to pour water over your head when there's no room above your head...
I do a shit job and just towel off while I'm still soapy; I ran out of water...
I get dressed and load up.
The Shrike won't start.
I give it a bit, and then hit it again. Nothing.
What do I do? If I keep trying I'll flood it...
What else *can* I do? I hit it again, and let it go and go and go.
It skips a turn and then coughs and roars into life.
So much black smoke...
I don't know how it's still living through this...
I ride out of the hotel courtyard and into a prominent spot in the middle of the village, which is starting to come alive.
I've got to kill the Shrike again to wait for Papi.
I hop off and pace the village.
I want to go *now*.
My brain’s already a blur of bad outcomes...
I’m pacing and pacing. A bloke nearby gets my attention and makes some weird gestures at me. He's trying to tell me something...
It's a *weird* charade. A tin soldier? A man climbing a rope?
What are you on about??
I shake my head at him, shrug, I’ve got no idea mate. “Qwa?? Ce qwa??”
He just keeps doing it. He won’t explain himself...
I say, louder, “Mon ami! Je ne comprend pa... Ce quoi??”
He’s keeping his mouth shut. Won’t *talk*. He stops moving and stands dead still, looks dead ahead.
I cog that the village is *dead silent*. Not a sound...
I look around, 360, and everyone, *everyone*, across the whole village, is standing *dead still*. No one’s moving an inch. No one’s saying a word.
I shut up. Stand frozen.
*What the fuck is going on here?*
There's the most pregnant of pauses.
What are we supposed to be doing??
I’ve never seen anything *like* this.
I don't even dare move my head anymore...
A whistle trills over the silence and the whole village re-boots like someone just pushed play...
Papi shows up. “Papi. Ce quoi, tout ca?”
He say’s something in French and makes charades just like the other bloke. Like he's climbing a rope.
So the whole village shuts down so a bloke can *climb a rope*? *What??*
“Drapo” goes Papi, and points at the sky.
Drapo?
Oh! Drapo! A *flag*!
*Bizarre*.
Papi fills me in.
Apparently, every single day at 7:30am on the dot they raise the national flag in every village in the *whole country*. The entire country needs to be silent and standing for it.
The penalty for non-compliance is an eye-watering $1,000.
I can't really believe that, but I think I might have just gotten away with one...
I also think I’ve been getting away with calling Papi, "Papi", when his name is actually “Baby”. I'm not sure I believe that either...
Anyway. Baby’s ready to rock and roll, but there’s one more thing he has to grab... He heads around the corner, and comes back with a big smile on his face and hands me two big tyre irons.
What a fucking legend.
I love this bloke.
They’re not *really* tyre irons; they’re just two lengths of iron “re-bar” that have had the ends smashed out with a hammer into a sort of spaded paddle.
Agricultural, sure, but it’ll work a charm.
Best gift I’ve ever been given.
I insist on giving him something for it but he insists back that he doesn’t want anything.
What a lad!
Baby jams a ridiculous plastic gridiron helmet on his head that looks like it's been made for a child, The Shrike coughs to life, and we’re away.
---
The warm fuzzys of the thoughtful gift don’t last for long.
I’m *tuned in*.
My whole body and mind are bent on picking up on the early signs of problems.
I jump at shadows again and again and again and again, each time looking down to the tyres, expecting disaster.
Anything sets me off; sounds, wobbles, how “hard” the tyres feel under the terrain...
Baby toots his horn at me from behind. I glance in my mirrors and he’s signalling me to stop.
But I already know what it means...
The tyre’s gone.
I’m *crushed*.
I get off the bike and the tyres are fine. They’re still full of air.
It’s the saddle bags that are on the piss... They’ve somehow shifted violently to one side, even though I’ve been taking things very conservatively.
It makes no sense.
I thank Baby for looking out for me, and straighten out the bags.
What I really need to do is straighten out my head.
I need to calm down.
This worrying about the tyres shit is frying me out.
We crack on for a while till we get to another village where Baby has some Red Cross work to do.
The poor bastard is caked in a layer of red dust from following me much too closely on the bike.
On the way out of the village we hit a checkpoint.
I shit my pants; I can't control it; I don't have the LP for the bike. 
The cop asks me for my name. Where I’m from. What am I doing here.
Then he tells me to have a nice day.
*Really?*
I'll take it.
---
I countdown the next twenty five kilometres, one by one, till, finally, the red dirt fades into tarmac.
I could kiss it.
I get off the bike and dance a jig.
That’s it.
We’re done.
It's the "goodbye dirt-road-Africa" dance.
There's not a shred of melancholy sadness left from yesterday morning. It's been tortured out of me.
Bye.
---
We rush on to Matadi on *really* good tarmac.
And it is a *rush*. I don’t know why, but even on the tarmac I’m still feeling spooked and in a hurry for no reason. I can’t shake off the feeling of urgency. Like I’m being chased. Or it’s a race or something.
I want to be in Matadi *now*.
Halfway there and Baby has to peel off; he's got more work to do.
He asks me for money for the tyre irons.
Of course I'll pay him, but it changes it from a nice gesture to something that seems a little more shrewd and a little less genuine.
It’s cheapened it a bit for me.
I give him twenty dollars and he's overjoyed.
I'm back to being solo...
---
The ride into Matadi is pretty nice; I could totally convince myself that I’m cruising some European foothills (except for the traffic, the demographic, the heat and the humidity, that is).
A couple of painless, shit-your-pants inducing checkpoints later and Matadi comes into view.
It’s pretty speccy.
It looks like a massive, sprawling village that’s been draped over a steep hillside.
I roll into the outskirts of Matadi and, unbelievably, there’s a proper, modern, petrol station there.
I fill the Shrike up right to the brim.
*Straightaway* it sounds healthy again.
It's done very well to put up with that stale, filthy donkey piss they call petrol.
Next stop, Matadi.
---
It’s fucking insane.
*Chaos*.
Completely out of control.
Panda-fucking-monium.
*Packed* roads – even for Africa – with trucks and cars and motorbikes and people and no fucking rules.
I want to shack up on the other side of the hill; over by the Anglolan consulate.
But, I’m not sure I'll make it...
The lions-share of the traffic are trucks carrying shipping containers. They're doing whatever the hell they want to do; they’re *all over* the road, impossible to predict.
The only thing they seem to be consistently and reliably doing is trying to run me over...
It’s close call after close call after close call.
I'll only need to be hit once...
The people aren’t much better.
I’m copping way, way more hissing and yelling and gesturing from the side of the road than is normal.
*Way* more.
With people swarming between the gaps in the trucks and all the other traffic they seem intent on trying to hold me up, trying to get in front of the bike and get in my way. It doesn’t help that they all tower over me.
It’s claustrophobic, belittling. It’s freaking me out.
This is *the bad* Congo, and the people aren’t helping me feel safe. Not one bit.
Then all at once some fucking insane bloke steps off the curb and onto the road right in front of me, shapes up to a fighting stance, screams, and feints to give me a judo chop right in the fucking neck as I ride past.
I nearly prang trying to avoid the hit.
I shit my pants for the second time today.
I wouldn’t have even come *close* to getting out the road if he wanted to belt me.
*What the fuck was that?*
My body's ready to fight someone.
I’m watching the clown in my rear vision mirrors to make sure he’s not chasing me, or that anyone else is going to have a go, or just figure out what the hell that was that he was getting at. But he’s just standing there, screaming something into my back.
I was on edge before, but that adrenaline dump... It's got nowhere to go. I'm off the charts. *Fizzing.*
DRC isn’t looking like a bundle of laughs.
---
I switchback up the hill.
A few more close calls with a few more trucks later and I crest the top, and head down the other side of the slope.
It’s like flicking a switch.
It’s almost *chilled*.
Tale of two cities...
I chomp over to the Angolan consulate through the spaghetti network of roads with relative ease.
The consulate is impressive – a proper, modern, big two storey building with a big perimeter wall and big metal gates. Imposing.
Time to find accommodation then...
---
It’s a clusterfuck.
Of course it is.
Hours of dicking around sizing up a number of shit options, only to go with the first shit option.
I’d fobbed off the first joint the first time around because it’s was outrageously bad value.
Problem was that all the other options make me want to kill myself.
*Truly* bad.
But, that said, I don’t think any of them had the bed covered in little nuggets of mouse shit, so they’re all a leg up from last night.
I’m not in the mood for going uber rough, so I had to go crawling back to the first joint.
I unpack the Shrike.
Time. To. Wander.
---
On this side of the hill things aren’t that bad. In fact, it feels like practically every other oversized village in Africa.
I go get cash. The machine works. And gives me some fresh U.S. dollars. Didn't expect that...
Things are looking on the up and up.
Honestly, I’m just happy to be in some civilisation again.
But, that said, I’m getting eyeballed on the street by *everybody*. I haven’t been eyeballed like this since, well, never...
Nine times out of ten it *seems* to be just out of plain curiosity, but the other time, well, I’m not too sure what *that* look is...
All fun and games.
All part of it.
---
Tomorrow I get the last roll of the dice; Angola visa or bust.
After these last few weeks I don't think I could handle the "death road" to Zambia, or whatever the fuck it's called.
2,000 clicks... 2,000 clicks of "death road".
I don't think it's something I could do even if I wanted to. And I don't want to.
I want that tarmac. I want those easy miles.
I want to get this thing *done.*
I want the end.

# BOOK THREE
## Chapter One
Morning.
Democratic Republic of the fucking Congo.
I front up to those big, imposing gates.
Angolan Consulate.
Last chance. It *has to work*.
I’m a ball of nerves.
I know that every action that I make from here on could be the difference between success and disaster.
Here we go.
*Smile*.
Grinning like a happy maniac I introduce myself to all the guards with the guns - handshakes and smiles all round. I stick around to have a chat with them in some rough French. Once I’m convinced that we’re all buddies, I follow their directions into the building.
Into the room and there’s a bloke standing behind a counter. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before... *Standing*, at a *counter*...
Anyway, he’s busy, so I make myself comfortable along with the other’s in the room and start sizing things up.
On the other side of the counter there are two blokes; a kid in uniform doing all the talking, and an old chubby fellow in plain clothes who’s just hanging around. They’re talking in Portuguese, so that’s no good. I watch carefully. From what I can cog, I reckon it’s the old boy who is the one to watch...
I stew in my seat, watching a clock on the wall tick for every second of nearly half an hour till I’m called up.
*Smile*.
Shake hands, try some Portuguese: “Mew nomee ee Luke”
The kid in the uniform is called something like “Doobrey” and the chubby checker is “Costa”.
So far so good. I try to go further: “Desculpo, senoras, no faalo Portu-ges, faalo Onglaise ooo francaise?”
Looks like we'll be talking in French, but I reckon that might get a little weird; them speaking their second language and me speaking a language I have a habit of butchering.
Well, it’s better than my Portuguese...
I ask them for a transit visa and hand over my passport.
The first question is like a broken record: “Why didn’t you get this in your home country?”
My heart breaks. I'm already scrambling. They can't knock me back that easy. They *can't*.
At least they’re asking me, not telling me – A question, and not a *statement*.
I tell them that I’ve been travelling in Africa for *years* – which is a bit of an exaggeration... I let it hang there, as though that's explanation enough.
They ask for my motivation letter. I give it to them.
No, not motivation, *vaccination*. The young fella does his best charade of shooting up heroin.
I'm lost in translation already...
I’ve freshly forged my “yellow card” - which is a vaccination certificate - so that it’s got yellow fever written in it. I'm glad for it; they can't trip me up there; it looks legit. (Just to note, I *have* been vaccinated for yellow fever, I just don't have the stamp; I'm not *insane*.)
They read my letter of motivation, I think that they’re pretty happy that I’ve gone to the effort to translate it into to Portuguese...
Brownie points right there.
They want a photocopy of every single page of my passport, even the blank ones, and photocopies of every page of my yellow card, even the blank ones, and photocopies of any and all of my motorbike’s papers, and two passport photos.
*Progress!*
They ask when I want to leave.
I don’t know what the right answer is... I want to answer anything that doesn’t get the reply “impossible”.
I say "next Thursday?" with a question mark...
Wrong answer.
Too conservative.
They say not to bother with any of it today. I should come back after the weekend on Monday morning.
Yes sir, that's fine, sir.
I don’t ask how long it will take, or how much it will cost, this meeting has gone well, I back away quietly.
---
So, I’ve got a weekend to kill.
What to do?
Cyber.
Soul destroying.
Things have not been going well... My extended time "off the grid" without warning, has whipped my family into a frenzy.
When I say my family, I mean Mum.
I go through the messages...
Imaginations of the violence being done to her son in the Congo after radio silence has gotten the better of her.
She finally snapped a few days back and had a meltdown.
I feel sorry for dad. He’s the one who has to tidy it all up.
I’m torn between sympathising with mum, and wondering at what point the umbilical cord is going to get cut...
I know already that her creepy answer would be “never”, but for me right now, lateish twenties would be fine.
Anyway. Like most sons who can do no wrong, I can do no wrong.
One message clears everything up.
I still reckon she’s going to kill me with her own hands if I keep this shit up.
After putting out that fire there's nothing left to do, and the connection here is so slow that it's like pulling teeth.
Time. To. Wander.
I head off downhill towards the river Congo.
It’s a bit of a walk, about an hours worth, but I’ve got nothing better to do than to walk through generic, mad Africa.
A warm, hot, smoky hour later and I hit the river and an impressive suspension bridge.
Looks pretty new, pretty solid. It’s completely out of keeping with the theme of the village.
The river Congo is moving along underneath it with a gentleness that hides the monstrous amount of water that it’s shifting. Throw in some gentle rolling, uninhabited, green mountains in the backdrop and it’s all quite neatly picturesque.
The guys with the guns won't let me cross.
I soak it in for a while and start the long walk back.
*Swoon*.
The world spins ever so slightly and sickeningly.
I can’t think straight. Can’t stand straight.
It’s so heavy that I have to stop... I bend lower to the ground to decrease the height of the fall a little bit.
Unpleasantly drunk, *wasted*, yet sober as a judge.
*I’m in trouble.*
Something’s very not right.
I strain against it. Grimacing.
It comes off a bit. I have to walk...
I can't think straight, but I can walk.
I’m ok. It’s ok. *Keep walking.*
---
For the whole hour back to hotel I can’t focus.
Not really.
I don’t *feel* like *me*.
I can’t stop fucking *swooning*. I feel like I’ve been spun in circles over and over and my head can’t catch up when my body stops turning.
Woozy.
I've been dying to lie flat. I even thought of doing it right there on the street...
I get back to the hotel.
Crash.
*What the fuck is happening to me?*
The room stops spinning.
What now? I've got nothing to do...
I read a book to kill some time and take my mind off it for a bit.
*War and Peace.* It’s been a grind. My e-reader say's I'm only 54% through...
For a book like this, reading to halfway has to be the equivalent of reading a shitload of normal books; every time I sit down to read it for what feels like an age I only lop off another 1%.
Fuck this.
I’d rather watch paint dry.
Or head to the “cyber”...
Yep. Done. I'm off.
---
This is just as bad...
The speed of the connection is like pulling teeth...
*Swoon*. Another *episode*.
I grab the screen of my laptop tightly to hold on to something that’s not moving as the whole room does cartwheels around my head.
I nearly fall off my chair; my balance is *rooted.*
Choked up. Spinning out.
I freak - the fuck - *out*.
I’ve righted myself. I *know* I'm up straight, but it doesn't *feel* like that. My head's lolling around. I can't *think!*
Hospital??
*Should I go to hospital??*
I can't *deal* with that...
Big, panicked, breaths through my nose.
Was I holding my breath?
My head's all fizzy, like my hair is electric on my scalp.
Am I hyperventilating now?
It’s time to go...
I throw some dirty money at the lady who runs the joint and rush back to the hotel room.
Onto the bed.
Lie flat.
Still.
---
And that’s where I stayed.
More or less for the rest of the day.
And then all of the next day.
I feel ok when I’m lying down, and I’m normal when I’m sleeping, I think...
Every time I go to go get up I feel that faint wooziness coming on.
The only time I take the chance to get up is to eat; because I have to.
And even when I’m lying down, my breathing won’t take care of itself. At least that’s the impression that I get. It *should *be something that just happens without conscious attention - of course - but I keep getting the feeling that when I'm not paying attention to it I'm not breathing enough.
Or I'm breathing too much...
So, I do it myself. I literally do my own breathing.
It’s exhausting.
Inevitably, I get it wrong. When that happens I feel faint. I’m never sure if I've been underdoing it or overdoing it, and I don’t know whether to breathe slower or faster to fix it.
I have to cop it all day - there's no alternative.
Even lying flat out on the bed, watching the ceiling, I still feel nothing like *normal*.
*Manually controlling my breath?* What’s *wrong* with me?
I should be fine; I’m not exerting myself, I’m getting plenty of rest, I’m eating plenty of food, drinking plenty of water.
I don’t feel crook.
Physically I���m fine. I couldn’t say a single thing that’s wrong.
So what’s going on then? Why can’t I even stand without losing my bearings and feeling like falling?
What’s going on?
I feel only a *sliver* like myself.
What happens if it gets worse? Worse than *this*... What happens if it gets so bad that I can’t help myself anymore? What if I wake up in the middle of the night and I *can’t move*, *can’t get help*? What if the room spins, spins worse, worse than I can handle... what if it doesn’t stop? What if I fall over and can’t get up again?
No one knows where I am... No one knows that something’s wrong with me.
I’m completely isolated out here.
I feel every ounce of the solitude. It's *crushing*. All day, every second I'm aware of it.
I just wish someone was here with me. Anyone. It would change *everything*.
Instead, I have to make the conscious, constant effort to hold back the screaming panic that’s *right there*, all the time. The tether is as thin as a thread.
I’m at breaking point. I can feel it.
All the time.
And I can’t support it...
It’s not bursts, it’s a *continuum*. Small forevers.
Forevers that don't break; that don't let up.
I can't do forever...
Sticking my head in the sand isn’t going to fix it. What are the alternatives?
Do I go to the hospital now?
Fuck I hate that idea... Not here - not in this place...
But what else is there? What else can I do?
I *can't* go home. Out of pure pigheadedness. Bloodymindedness. I *won't* leave now. Not unless it gets worse...
There's really nothing else. Either go to a hospital, go home, or keep going.
Here are my ranked thoughts on what it *actually* might be:
"Very, very bad": I have cancer in my brain. Angry cancer. And this is "End Game".
"Very bad": I have something that I've picked up - Malaria or Typhoid or something of that ilk - or I have a parasite that’s eating my brain. Something exotic and African. Something you get from showering in river water. When it chews I *swoon*.
"Bad": I've fucked my brain on weed - which I smoked one time and had a similar "I'm not me/spinning room/out of control" reaction to. With the fucked brain, I'll be having these episodes at random for the rest of my life - but they are harmless.
"Not so bad": these episodes are a bad vertigo or something that's transient and not specific to me or my situation. Just shit luck.
"Also not so bad": this is my body’s way of reacting to the stresses I’ve been having.
So yeah, that’s the rap sheet of bandits.
That’s what I reckon. But what do I know? Frag all. I only have guesses.
I think that’s what’s chewing at me; I don’t know what it is. It kills me not to know if this is going to get better by itself or if it’s going to get worse the longer I avoid doing something about it.
That uncertainty...
Well, there’s always suicide.
I’m not thinking of it. Well, that’s not true. I *am* thinking of it. But thinking of something isn’t the same as considering something.
That’s different.
I’m not *considering* suicide.
That’s absurd.
But the thought of it, and knowing it’s there, well, it’s weirdly comforting. Something’s telling me though - morally or ethically or something else ending in a “double l + y” - that suicide's not right. That it's a bad option.
I shouldn’t be thinking of it like a comfort.
But I do; it feels like a parachute, like a handbrake. I think... It’s like no matter how bad it gets, there’s never no getting out of it.
I’m not *trapped* here.
At the very end, there’s *always* that option, it’s *always* there.
It's an option I’d *never* consider, *never* entertain - but an option, nonetheless.
---
Monday.
Consulate.
It's the first time I've left my room in days, except occasionally to eat.
Meals have been skipped.
I've been sleeping long hours. Sleeping is the only time when things seem to be taking care of themselves - like normal. That can’t be a bad thing, so I’ve been spending most of my time trying to sleep.
I've tried to read books, but I can’t stay focused long enough to make any progress; I catch myself reading the same sentence or paragraph over and over and over again because I can’t pay attention. None of it’s going into my head. All I see is words, and my brain can't make meaning. It might as well be in Swedish.
When I try to force it for too long I start to feel lightheaded again, and start to feel things slipping out of control.
So I sleep. It’s my only respite. When I can’t do that, I stare blankly at the ceiling.
I've emerged from it squinting and with a limb numbing lethargy.
I look like shit. Sickly.
The morning has been an out of body experience.
I've been busy getting all my shit in a pile, armed and ready for the Consulate, photocopying *everything*.
When I find myself talking with the guard at the front gate I’m not sure how I’ve gotten here...
Time to switch on.
This is important.
I know it. But I can't snap the woozy fog...
Should I try again tomorrow? I might feel better then...
And do what? Spend another day in that bed?
No. Get on with it. This *has* to be done.
I head in.
My mate behind the counter, Doubre, doesn’t seem too happy to see me. There’s no chubby Costa either.
Despite being the last thing I feel like doing, I plaster a smile on my face. I try to make small talk.
He takes my pile of papers off me and starts with the passport.
He’s flipping through it and then says something.
Something bad.
He’s pointing me out something. He’s not impressed... He’s saying words to the effect that it’s no good because it needs *three* blank pages and I only have *two* blank pages.
*Panic*.
I hate hate hate this. Loath it. Tiny little semantic bullshit that can get you tripped up. If he wanted to he could help me. I know it. Instead, he’s being a piece of shit. He knows how important this is for me. He knows this is my last shot. He must; I could throw a rock to the border. But he’s going to reject me for being one page short of the requirement, just because he can.
This would be so *easy* for him to let slide.
I hate him.
I scramble. And default to an old tactic: pretending I don't understand the French.
I'm hoping he can’t be bothered explaining it to me again and again and again in his second language and eventually just thinks “fuck it” and gets on with it.
It doesn't work; he’s remarkably patient...
I tell him I’ve got *another* passport - an Australian one - back at the hotel that’s good. *Lots* of pages. Nothing but empty pages. He tells me to go and get it and he wants all the photocopies for that one as well.
I’m not dead in the water yet...
I’m not too sure how they’re going to deal with my dual citizenship, and I've been keeping that hidden in an attempt to avoid misunderstandings; like them thinking that I'm some sort of James Bond spy. But I've gotta give it a go.
What else can I do?
---
You wouldn't know that I'm shaking, but I am.
This time Costa the chubby is here.
I hand everything over to Costa.
He seems confused.
He shuffles through the papers again and again. He can’t figure it out, and then asks me in French something along the lines of “why are you applying for two people?”
*Shit*.
It’s sort of a fair question; my passport photos couldn’t be more un-alike. One is an eighteen year old boy; the other is a twenty six year old man. Even I can hardly connect the two. What chance does a total stranger have?
I try to explain to Costa that they’re *both* me, and explain what Doubre was saying. He just shakes his head and gives me back all of my Australian papers and copies.
The British ones are fine.
Halle-fucking-luiah.
Costa: my saviour.
I fill in all the necessary forms. Funnily enough, it’s the first visa in a frighteningly long time that I haven’t had to lie on. Not once - no fabricated hotel bookings or letter of invitations or two references. None of it.
B-e-a-utiful.
They’re running out of things to trip me up on.
Costa tells me it’s going to cost $101.
U.S. dollars...
One hundred and one dollars, for a *transit* visa that lasts *ten days*.
It's the worst value visa on the planet.
Do I care? *Nope.*
I’m cashed up and ready to do this deal *now*, but Costa says that’s no good. I can’t pay *here*. Instead, I’ve got to go and make a “bank deposit”.
*Pain* in the *arse*.
I can see why they do it – not handling the money themselves leaves a lot less wriggleroom for corruption and cooking the books.
Whatever. I’m just glad to be making progress.
---
The bank's a goddamn trek. Half a village away.
I’m not doing well.
All I want to do is lie down for a bit to clear this dizzy light-headedness.
How do I, in French, say "Hello, I'd like to make a bank deposit to the Angolan Consulate for $101 to pay for a transit visa, please"?
This isn't going to be easy...
I try to open the front door, but I can't.
It’s not locked... There’s just someone blocking the door on the other side.
I poke my head in, and it’s packed.
*Packed*, packed.
There’s hardly enough room inside for me to muscle in through the front door.
It's not a small room either, this is a big bank; it’s just *that* busy.
What a fucking mess.
So much for worrying about my French. That’s the least of my problems.
What now?
I muscle through the crush to get to the tellers once, twice, three times, each time only to be sent to the other corner of the bank to talk to someone else...
It takes a long, *long* time before I finally hook a fish and I get taken into the back.
We head through a lot of random corridors, with random people, getting told to wait and then being picked up again at random intervals.
Something feels very shady about this. Like I'm getting through the layers of security into some sort of unlicensed dog fighting or something...
There are locals carrying around *armfuls* of the local currency, walking through the corridors like worker bees carrying nectar.
I get marched down a set of stairs and through a dimly lit basement. It's *filled* with a small army of money counters, crunching through *piles* of currency.
Yep. Shady as fuck...
*What’s going on here?* I get the feeling I’m seeing something that’s definitely not for my eyes. What do they think that I want to do?
Did I mess up my French?
I'm escorted through the piles of cash and up another flight of steps and told to wait outside a door with a small group of people.
A cantankerous middle aged woman - in one of those see-through green visor caps that wouldn’t look out of place at a smoky poker table - pokes her angry head around the blacked-out door from time to time to pull someone else into the room...
When it’s finally my turn I head in and see what I’ve gotten myself into...
Turns out I’d got it right, which is more astounding than if I’d gotten it wrong; this is where you come to make a bank deposit...
It's painless. I pay in cash.
That done, and little bank slip in hand, I head back - without an escort this time - through the money counters and maze of corridors and the crush of the mob, out the front and into the light of day.
African banks are fucking crazy.
I make a beeline back to the Consulate. At the desk it’s Doubre again, and some new player - a middle aged woman.
I introduce myself, her names Maria, said with a Portuguese flair.
They go and get my file and come back. Maria flicks through my passport and says that there aren’t enough pages.
*Fuck*.
Doubre wants to know where my other passport is.
*Fuck!*
Maria wants to know *what other passport?*
The bastards are ganging up on me...
I panic.
*Shit*.
I explain that Costa said that it was all good. Can we see Costa?? Please?
They oblige.
Please, please, please, please...
We find Costa.
He saves my bacon, *again*.
I leave the new money slip with them and I’m told to come back in two days.
That's not exactly confidence inspiring; I’ve been in *that* situation before...
But, I’m still in the game.
---
Two days.
Two days with the uncertainty hanging over my head.
All of my uncertainty.
It sits on me.
What’s the longest amount of time I've spent with zero outside stimulus? Just me in my head, on a bed?
It’s *maddening*.
Nothing’s changed.
There’s still not a single waking moment when I feel anything close to “normal”, and there’s the constant threat that any second, *imminently*, everything could go balls up in a way that's irreversible.
Unrecoverable.
Forty eight hours of it...
It’s simmered my nerves to the point where I’m going to snap.
I’m scared of what that might mean.
I’m not taking care of myself.
This isn’t good for me, and I know it, but I can’t make myself do things, because what if that makes *it* worse. Whatever “*it*” is. 
How the fuck am I going to *ride??*
I wish there was someone here with me. 
---
D-Day.
I’ve still got an invisible tremor I can’t stop.
Walking up to the gates, I’m so tense and nervous I can’t stand it.
They’re going to reject me on a technicality. I know it.
Fuck, I can’t deal with this anymore.
It’s too much.
I head through the gate and head in.
It’s Doubre the Arsehole again. No knight-in-white-shining-armour Costa the Chubby.
*Smile*.
Doubre, the shithead, says that they don’t have my visa.
Come back in the afternoon.
My tension ratchets a notch.
I don’t know if I can take it.
I keep pumping myself up to leave the hotel room and face the prospect of getting rejected and they keep leaving me in the dark.
Fuck. What if they say they’re going to send the application to Luanda again, like they did back in the other Congo...
I don’t think I could take that.
I think that’ll be my snapping point.
The straw that broke the camel’s back.
---
Another half a day lying in the head spin of the hotel room.
I head off to the place that I’ve been heading to eat every single meal during my time here - when I eat...
It’s a little tin shack just up the road from the hotel.
Closeness to that bed where the world stops spinning has been the priority, but I’ve also lucked out for my week here because the food is some of the best I’ve had in the whole trip.
There's something chewy called *quanga*, which is like eating a tasty rubber dildo, along with three other piles of indistinguishable goop and some beans. Okra’s in there somewhere, not that I've ever known what "Okra" is... The other goop tastes like fish, though I’m not sure that it’s supposed to... It tastes pretty damn good.
Addictively good, in fact.
A middle aged bloke comes into the shack with one of those nasty little double sided razor blades. I’ve never known what they’re used for... It’s just a flat, thin piece of flimsy metal the size of a matchbox with each edge of the metal honed to a shiver-inducing sharpness.
Scalpel sharp.
No one seems surprised when the chef comes out of the kitchen, sits down on the razor man’s stool, and gets a good, dry, face shave. Totally routine.
Razor man’s paying very careful attention to what he’s doing, just like a barber might give someone a straight shave, I guess, chipping away with careful little tremors. But it still looks rough as guts, not to mention bloody dangerous.
For me, it’s like having a TV dinner; meal and entertainment at the same time. I forget the consulate and the visa. I sit, rapt, while absently shovelling food in my mouth; ready to see if something goes horribly, horribly wrong.
I wonder how many people he’s shaved with *that* blade in the neighbourhood? I bet it’s a number close to “everyone”.
Did I mention that the chef is a woman?
Yep.
And she’s getting her face shaved.
It’s *actually* happening.
Casually as you like. No one’s batting an eyelid.
If we’re being honest, it’s a pretty important service. Hair gets pretty out of hand here if not kept in check. I guess faces are no different.
And, when I say face, I don’t mean the old five-o’clock-shadow either.
I mean *face*.
*All of it.*
Forehead. Nose. Cheeks. All come in for close attention.
The shaver guy *literally* chips away with the razor blade over the *entire* surface of her face, leaving only the eyebrows, eyelashes and eyelids behind.
With a *razor blade*, for Christ sakes. Talk about razor burn... that’s gotta hurt like hell!
Razorman’s played knifey spoony before, he’s an *operator*, and he’s done the job in impressive speed and efficiency.
He eyeballs me and my pre-pubescent, many-month-old, scraggly effort at a beard and holds the razor up and raises his eyebrows.
Nah thanks mate, I’ll pass this time...
---
I head back to reality, back to the consulate, and the tension ratchets one more time.
I’ve been in and out enough now for the security to just give me a knowing nod to let me through.
I head to the desk inside and it’s still Doubre the wank-stain. He sees me and before I can say a word he walks off.
Is he *avoiding* me?
Long minutes pass.
What the fuck is going on?
He comes back and hands me my bashed up passport.
I look at him and then back to the passport and back to him.
“Ce ici??” I point. *Is it here??*
“Wee”.
I rifle through the passport, and there, on the last page, is a new, full page sticker.
“Angola Visa” is written across the top.
I’ve never been happier.
This is better than all Christmases, all birthday’s, all anything’s all put together.
Pure, euphoria.
It’s *over*.
It’s finally *over.*
I check the details, and I’ve never been happier for a shittier visa.
Single entry, *five* days.
Five!
Doubre the cunt's fucked me even on the duration.
At one hundred and one bucks, it’s hands down the worst value visa I’ve ever had.
But I could hug Doubre, the piece of shit.
I try to maintain my professionalism till I’m at least out of the gates and around the corner.
But I can’t.
I fist pump and shadow-box my way through the consulate courtyard. I jump and click my heels as I walk through the gates and down the street.
---
Today’s it.
Goodbye to “*Africa* Africa”.
Finally. Paved roads. Proper infrastructure. Modern living.
Bring that on.
I’ll miss *Africa* Africa, in a Stockholm Syndromey kind of way... But I can’t wait to just relax and, I don’t know, eat a tub of yoghurt.
Whatever.
It was about the time that I got the passport and Angola visa in my hot little hands that I’ve started to feel a lot like myself again.
It’s weird, and it makes me think that it might somehow be related.
I’m not totally there yet... I still feel a little weird and, well, *off*. But, for 90% of the time my head is clear, I can think like I normally do, and I have my coordination back. I feel “orientated”. Planted. *Here.*
My head’s back on my shoulders.
The whole week - regardless of whether I’m feeling alright at the moment - has left me feeling a bit fragile and vulnerable.
Honestly, it's scared me shitless.
I don’t know what’s going to happen next, and the speed at which an *episode* comes on has left me pretty spooked.
But, I've got to get on with it.
I've got one last hurdle for this trip: Getting through the border.
From there, it’s five big days of riding to traverse *massive* Angola – which won’t be a cakewalk, but good tarmac will help. After that I'm on to Namibia and lovely, modern South Africa; both of which do visas on entry.
Then I’m home and hosed.
It’s close. It *feels* close. So close that I can, maybe, measure the "time to home" in weeks. Maybe even *days*.
Bring *that* on.
The Shrike gets loaded up and I take one last look at the hotel that I’ve wallowed in for the last week with something approaching disgusted nostalgia. It’s been good to me, but Jesus it’s sucked.
I head off.
It’s a darkly overcast day and the whole town feels gloomy and *damp*.
The border is spitting distance from Matadi.
In ten minutes I’m onto the "border road", which - unsurprisingly - is untarred and a bit of a mess.
It's not long to the border proper.
It’s got a little mini village sprouted up around it, but all of it still feels like an extension of Matadi. 
Strategy for this side of the border: Avoid Customs at all costs; I don't have an LP, which is definitely something that border Customs would crack the shits over.
I park up right up at the boom gate.
It’s another one of these posts where it’s not particularly obvious what’s what.
I get handballed about for a bit and I’m at risk of looking like that guy who’s got no fucking idea what he’s doing – ripe to being taken advantage of...
Through more arse than class I get picked up by a middle aged old bloke in a *very* serious looking uniform.
I get the feeling he’s the boss around here...
His hands look like a packet of twisties; totally, uselessly crippled. Gnarled like old tree roots. They look to me like they’re good for nothing but picking your nose, but, sure enough, he manages to shove a pen between the digits and somehow starts writing down my details in a massive fat ledger book.
It’s excruciating to watch.
Not least because of how long it takes him to write each letter...
Poor bastard has the writing of a six year old... I’m not sure I could do any better with the tools supplied.
I feel like taking over for him, but I’m not sure that he’d go for that - he seems to be the proud type, what with that fancy uniform he's got and all...
I spend the very, very long interval wondering how his fingers ended up like that, and if it had anything to do with the DRC’s colourful past.
Who knows? I’m not about to ask.
He finishes off the thirteenth labour of Hercules and tells me to go see Customs.
Shit. Can’t do that... My French suddenly melts into shit, and, by magic, I don't "understand" anything he's telling me; I hope he just thinks I'm an imbecile and gives me the stamp.
We go in circles again and again and again. He’s as tenacious and as patient with me as he was with his handwriting...
*No stamps till I see Customs.* He won't budge.
It's a first; no one at Immigration has ever sent me to Customs before... Not for *leaving* a country anyway...
Had to happen when I don't have the papers, didn’t it?
*Here we go..*.
I head around to the Customs building I'd been ducking and weaving since I got here.
I've no idea how I’m going to tackle this...
I stump up to the bloke at the front and go through the usual introductions of apologising for my terrible French with a big smile and handshakes all round.
He’s another one from the population of people who’ve never smiled once in their life. Not *once*.
I explain that he needs to go and tell the Immigration guy that it’s ok to stamp me out of the country.
“Papy-airs.” Papers. *Great.*
All I can give him are my flimsy rego papers. They’re a bit of a fragile mess these days, not unlike me, so I add “dousa-mon, dousa-mon” which is how I imagine the word is spelt for “take it easy”.
He looks all over the rego with a face of confused annoyance.
He tells me that they’re no good. He wants to know where my carnet is...
Fucking *great*. Here we go...
I tell him that that’s all I have, with no other explanation, because I don’t really have one... I figure that all I’m going to do is hang myself if I keep talking, so I pretend to be very interested by something else going on in the fairly busy room.
It’s not going to be enough...
He continues to scrutinise my papers and then accidentally tears them in two.
*God damn it!* They so very nearly made it all the way, my battered and bashed papers... Cleaved forever.
I'm *furious*.
I revert to some English that the boss wouldn’t know the meaning of and let fly. He gets the gist...
I think that he thinks that he’s just fucked a document that is a little more important than it actually is...
He freaks out, says it’s all ok, hands it all to his stand-by lackey and points us out the door and back to Immigration with instructions to give me the ok.
Lucky break, I guess...
The passport disappears with the lackey somewhere deep into the Immigration building and they won’t let me follow it to keep an eye on things; which I’m *not* a big fan of.
I wait around outside for a long time. I'm the squeaky wheel, making a lot of noise...
My mate the boss comes out front with the passport in his fucked up fingers. Stamped.
DRC: in the fuckin can.
Half way done...
## Chapter Two
Angola.
There’s a massive, *massive* mob out front of the Immigration building, which, apparently, won’t open till nine o’clock.
No bother; I don’t have to crush a massive distance today. It'd be handy, but I don't *have* to.
At nine there’s a mad scramble to get into the Immigration building. A proper African scramble.
One of the officials spots me out in the crowd and comes and grabs my passport and drags me in.
Not sure why I should get special treatment - I was well back in the crowd - but I’m not about to refuse it.
Straightaway the language barrier is a nightmare. Border crossings in French are hard enough, but at least I can make myself understood.
Portuguese? Forget about it. I thought I had enough of the basics under my belt after spending a few days doing audio lessons.
Nope.
I can’t explain *shit*.
It takes a while of frustrated charades from both sides to finally get some progress.
I get my passport thrown onto the pile, and from there it's just a question of watching and waiting.
It’s a slow grind.
Even though all anyone's doing is picking up a passport, finding a page and stamping it, it all seems to happen in slow motion.
A fair whack of dead time passes before I’ve finally got my stamp and we can move on to Customs.
---
Customs doesn’t exist...
At least, I can't find it.
It’s driving me nuts.
Each person sends me off somewhere new, somewhere newly wrong.
After a lot of frustrated asking around in Portuguese, and mostly deferring to French - which despite being no one’s mother tongue seems to be easier - I’m ready to throw in the towel and roll the dice for Angola just like I did for DRC.
Some guy comes over to me and tells me to follow him, and we head into an office where all the furniture is still covered in plastic, like they just moved in.
He asks for my Carnet.
I’ve no idea how to do this in Portuguese...
Passavant. Laissez-passer. Temporary import permit. I say all of them. The guy's got no idea what I’m talking about. He wants to see my *carnet*...
We go around and around and around in circles. He wants to help me - I can tell - but he can’t. He only seems to understand carnets, and doesn’t seem to understand how I’ve come all this way without one.
He’s looking at my rego papers with his pen like he’s trying to find the part of it that he writes in and stamps...
I pull my other Congo “passavant” out of my bag to give him an example of what I’m talking about.
He scrutinises it and doesn’t look pleased. Says something in Portuguese that sounded a bit like “Sorry, haven’t got any of these...”
He flips it over onto the blank side and starts writing something on it.
Scribbles a signature.
Whacks a wet stamp onto it.
Solemnly hands it back to me.
Hilarious.
Full marks for effort, I guess...
*It'll do.*
I've no idea what he's written on that paper, but, whatever it is, I'm sure I can talk my way around it.
In any case, it’s better than nothing.
Righto then. It’s already past eleven o'clock. I don’t know where those two hours evaporated off to.
But I don’t care.
I’m *in*.
*Africa* Africa is finally done.
It’s the beginning of the end.
What a relief.
---
I peel off down the shitty border road.
I pass a shitty border town.
The road for some reason gets shittier.
It's gone rocky and bouncy.
I laugh.
I guess *Africa* Africa wasn't done with me just yet.
I have some fun with it, as I bounce and zigzag all over the place.
*The last hurrah...*
Coming around each new bend I’m leaning out to the side to try to catch my first glimpses of the good tarmac with a grin on my face.
Can’t be long now.
I pass a tiny village that looks *dirt* poor. No corner shops or any semblance of modernity whatever. Just village people in a handful of mud huts along the roadside. They're just taking the air - there's nothing else for them to do.
It’s *way* sub-par, even for Africa. 
I’m chompin for the tarmac. *I can’t wait*. Hankering badly for it.
I make a trickling progress.
It might be one of the worst roads I’ve been on in the whole trip... Hard. Technical. So *bouncy*.
Just a mess.
There’s fuck all out here, nothing but reedy scrub lining the road and the occasional tree.
Is this a *“Savannah"*? Could be...
I pass another dirt poor village.
And then another.
No traffic, very few people.
It all feels half-way abandoned.
I go and I go and I go, and it’s still dirty, bouncy, tricky rock track.
*Where’s the tarmac??*
---
Two hours pass. *Two hours*.
Not even a sniff of tarmac.
*Piss on this*. I’ve had enough.
I’m far enough from the border now, right? There’s been enough villages gone past, *surely.*
My expectation of getting in a couple of hundred easy clicks in before the end of the day has been shat all over.
*It wasn’t supposed to be like this.*
Nothing like this.
Every man and his dog has told me that the roads in Angola are good enough to eat off.
I'm not ready for this...
I light up the GPS.
I’ve made no progress. *None*.
Haven’t even put a dent in the line I wanted to chart today. The last two hours of hard work have been for close to nought.
At this pace, on this fucking road, I might be able to get - maximum - another hundred clicks before it’s dark. *Maximum*.
And if something goes tits up? If *I* go tits up? Well. Fucked then, I guess.
A deep heat starts in the middle of my sternum and it quickly invades my whole chest, spreading outwards all over, crawling all over. It runs up my neck, tightening up, strangling me. Choked.
I’m ready to pull over the bike and bawl my eyes out.
I want to. But it won’t happen for me. For some reason it all just stays bottled there. It won't spill over the edge and be let out.
I don’t know why. I wish it would.
Self-preservation?
I don't know.
I don't skip a beat, and keep bouncing on.
*I was finished with dirt*.
I think that’s what’s worse. I’d finished it. Celebrated. *Danced a jig*. I was expecting a cakewalk and I’ve got a grind. It’s blindsided me. Oblivious.
I haven’t got *any* food with me. Not a bite.
I’m running pretty low on water. A smidgen swishing around the bottom of my bottle.
I *need* tarmac and I need *proper villages* with food and water. I need them soon.
---
Another hour.
I'm desperate.
Zig-zagging, up and down, bouncing, grinding, rocky, first gear crawl.
I hit a village.
"Village?" That’d be kind... It’s a handful of buildings. One’s got bricks - which is a first. Promising, even. The rest are all small huts.
The joint looks deserted. Though there’s one bloke that I can see, and no one else.
The moment I pull to a stop I’m drenched in sweat.
It won't evaporate and just pools everywhere, the air's so stale.
It’s fucking warm.
It’s those thick, dark clouds overhead that are doing it...
I start up a conversation with the last man alive. I get the pleasantries out of the way and skip the small talk altogether and get down to business – my Portuguese isn’t hot enough for chat, and English or French would be worse...
On to charades.
I gesture my fingers near my mouth like an expressive Italian: Food?
Shake of the head from last man standing: No.
*Shit*.
I tilt an invisible can of coke into my mouth: Water?
Shake of the head and even a wag of the finger this time: Nope.
*Fuck.*
I can go without food, and go hungry, but water? Well, no... Not in these conditions.
Shrug of the shoulders from me with hands up near the shoulders like an Egyptian carrying invisible turds: Where?
He points down the road where I’m going.
“Quanto?” from me, which is about as eloquent as I’m going to get for "how much?" in Portuguese.
“Quanto? Mmmmmm… *Bar bar bar bar* noventa queelometros”
Noventa?? Did he just say *noventa*?
Noventa sounds a lot like the Italian "nove". Nove is nine...
Ninety then? *Ninety*?
Better fucking not be.
Ninety clicks will have me there, at this rate, by six tonight. And that’s not going to work. Clearly.
I point at the ground and stamp on it with my boots, and do a flat hand dance from the 80's: Tarmac? I take a punt at the Portuguese, “Tarmaco? Bitumeno? Asphalto?”
Zombie apocalypse survivor perks up.
“*Assfallto?*”
Ha! Who said language was hard? "Si! Assfallto? Quanto?"
*I Am Legend* points again, down the road. “Assfallto *bar bar bar* Noventa.”
Fuck. Off.
This is a fucking ordeal now...
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
I make like a guy taking a standing nap on prayer hands: Somewhere to sleep?
“*Bar bar bar bar bar bar*, Noventa. Noventa.”
Oh *god*.
Four questions, four answers. Ninety kilometres. Ninety. With *nothing* between.
I’m *fucked*.
“Nomay de villa?”
“Nome? Tom-bocco”
Tomboco. I’ve got to make it to Tomboco. Fast.
“Obrigado sinyor”
I vault onto the Shrike and ride on.
---
Like a man possessed.
I’m *freaking out*.
My head’s a blur of maths; divisions to calculate arrival time.
What's not taken up by that is completely dedicated to shit your pants “what if” scenarios.
The seemingly endless deal breakers that the Shrike could throw up.
Or *I* could throw up...
My concern for the tyres is bordering on a deranged phobia. The knobs on the tyres have been whittled over the thousands of kilometres down to a nub.
I’m *keenly* aware of the quality of inner tubes that I’ve got in both wheels: Chinese wrapping paper.
And this road is *Punctureville*.
And there’s no traffic out here. *None.* If something does go balls up, it’s going to be a long walk or a long wait, and, even after the long walk or wait, there’s still *no food*, no *water*.
What if my body decides to crap out and have another “episode”, another swoon. What if I can't stop it and it won't go away? What then?
As my head churns and I think it can't get any worse, the track deteriorates.
It’s an absolute *dog’s breakfast*.
The ruts are so *deep*, and the wheel tracks so completely all over the place. I’m convinced that this is impossible on anything with more than two wheels. Maybe two is even too many; It'd be hard to do this even on foot...
*One* mistake - one lapse of attention on this skinny track - and we’ll slide off the road into a trench on the roadside as deep as I am tall.
*Fucked.*
It’s supposed to be *modern* and fucking *tarmac*.
I pass a group of kids and they all freak the fuck out and run off screaming, *terrified*.
Never seen that before...
Some of them throw themselves into the bushes in a way that looks like it’s bloody painful. All to get away from me and the Shrike...
It's *remote* out here...
---
At the next "village" there’s a sign for a restaurant.
*Hallelujah*.
Deliverance. I can fill up to my gills with water and chow.
I poke my head in, it's empty...
I ask around the village about the restaurant. They point me down the road, “Tomboco”.
I insist *again*. Surely there must be *some* food. What’s everybody else eating?
Finally, someone brings me some bananas. 
*That's a start.*
I try to charade water. But something's getting lost in translation.
After a lot of confusion I cog that they’re telling me that they could go and get me some water from a well... The only thing worse than the current situation would be the current situation with me blowing chunks of that greasy omelette breakfast out my mouth, or otherwise shitting it through the eye of a needle.
Non, *obrigado* sinyor”.
---
Another hour hour.
I slide past a woman on the track who looks absolutely *petrified*. As I go by she lets off a screaming, sabre-rattling, spear-shaking *war cry* right in my face.
“YEEEEAAAAAAH-AH-AH-AH-AH!!”
Bet I look just as freaked out as she does...
It’s not like I fucking snuck up on her; you can hear the Shrike from a mile down the road.
What the fuck is all this about then? First the screaming, terrified kids, and now this woman's shrieking in my face.
She must think I’m one of the riders of the apocalypse.
Lunatics.
---
It starts to rain.
To pass the time, I start to sing “Why does it always rain on me?”.
I feel like I’m going to have a mental breakdown.
I’m not sure if I can take anymore...
Every village I pass I stop in and ask the same questions: Food, water, shelter, tarmac.
“Tomboco”.
It’s getting on... Despite it not being *terribly* late on the clock, the heavy cloud has made it feel twilightish.
The day is slowly starting to wrap up.
I light up the GPS.
I’m still nowhere near where I need to be; not even close.
After a while the rain stops.
The rear tyre... It’s *gone*.
I can *feel* it.
Horror.
I twist around, and there it is, wallowing and flapping away under the weight.
No.
No I *can’t*...
In an instant, making it to Tomboco before dark has gone from unlikely to impossible.
My brain turns off. I become something mechanical. A robot.
A tyre changing robot.
I pull over the bike and go through the steps.
I’ve got the wheel off and onto the ground, lying flat.
It doesn’t matter how much I jump on the tyre wall, how much I dig my boot heels into it, the tyre is *glued* to the rim. Without making space between the two, there’s nowhere to fit my tyre irons.
Without creating space I can do nothing...
Sweat’s flying everywhere as I stomp and jump and stomp.
It’s not working, so I stop.
Standing there, getting my breath back, sweat dripping off the nose, thirst biting in the back of my throat, I realise there’s nothing else I can do. No alternative.
Fucked at the first hurdle.
Guess I’ll keep stomping and jumping, then.
What else am I going to do?
I’m sweating like no one’s business; already saturated through, and that’s a problem. Maybe my biggest problem; I drank my last drop of water a fair while back... There's nothing left and there hasn't been for quite some time.
Maybe I should stop and wait? Avoid dehydrating myself further if the tyre's not going to unstick anyway?
But then, who's coming? There's zero traffic. *Zero.*
*Why does it always have to be impossible?*
Despair comes hot on the heels of defeat...
I throw my toys, accept my fate.
I give it another jumping stomp.
The tyre and rim separate all at once and I nearly go arse over tit with the unexpected giving out of the tyre.
I'm not even happy.
Back to robot mode.
I change the tube with (relative) ease. The new tyre irons from my mate *Baby* have saved me.
Out comes the punctured tube, and with it comes a random big chunk of rubber. I'm not sure what that does...
In goes the battered and bruised, twice punctured and twice patched veteran tube of thirty thousand of the hardest kilometres.
*God help me.*
I’m shitting my pants.
Just like the last time, the fat fucker is tricky to squeeze in between the rim and the tyre.
Just like the last time this is my only spare.
It all seems so familiar.
Except there’s even less traffic on this road, not to mention less daylight to play with, less water, less everything.
Angola really has pulled my pants down and caught me unawares... Right in the arse.
I take time that I don't have, and gently get the tube in.
I lever the tyre back in with absolute care.
The moment of truth: I pump it up.
I pump it up as much as I dare, unscrew the and listen...
Nothing.
It’s holding air, I think...
I rub my ear along the whole length of tyre wall, wide-eyed, and I can’t hear a sound. It’s a good start.
Nothing else for it but to put it all together and cross the fingers that it continues to hold, not to mention praying that I don’t get another puncture, which would, well, I don’t want to think about another puncture...
I’m still committed to getting to Tomboco, no matter how far I have to ride in the dark on this hell road; I have no alternative.
Back on the Shrike.
---
My nerves are shot to pieces.
I’ve lost all confidence in the tyres and the tubes and I’m way beyond hypochondria. Every time there’s a wiggle in the bike, or something just doesn’t "feel right", or that there’s a sound that is a little different, or that the bike bounced a little too *softly* off that rock - *every time*, I’m certain that the tyres are gone and that I’m fucked. *Doomed.*
I’m having to pull over *constantly* to satisfy my obsessive-compulsive-disorder and see how they’re doing.
The tyre change, despite being relatively straight forward, has still taken it’s time, and its toll.
I’m fucking exhausted.
My brain is going a bit fogged and demented with it all.
Everything turns into a dogged haze of just riding on and getting it done.
I have a quick look at the GPS.
Allegedly, I’ve done eighty since the start of the day. *Eighty.* In a *full* day.
According to the GPS, there’s still forty clicks to go to Tomboco.
I'm not even within cooee of jogging it out. Not today...
Forty is going to take me *at least* a couple of hours, and well into the dark. Things are getting more gloomy by the minute...
The idea of the dark, riding in it, and - if I’m lucky - making it to an *unknown* village at the finish line is scaring the shit out of me.
This bouncy rock hop is tricky enough when I *can* see where I’m going in full light. In pitch black with a manic headlight is going to be, well, *interesting*.
And even if the bike can handle it, I’m not sure how I’m going to. A week ago I couldn’t get out of bed without feeling like I’m going to die. And now this?
There are red flags everywhere.
But what else can I do?
---
Thirty clicks to go.
I’m so tuckered out.
Having to change the tyre tube *really* took it out of me. The closer I get to Tomboco the further away it feels, the kilometres and time ahead seem to dilate and stretch the more knackered I get.
I've never felt so far away from Tomboco.
I’m so *thirsty*...
I think I’ve stopped sweating... Which, I don’t know, seems to be bad thing right now; like I’ve just run out of the stuff.
I don’t know where my brain is finding the energy to think. But it’s mostly negative, and I can’t get away from it. It’s so defeatist, but my exhaustion and solitude is dominating my ability to keep a positive attitude, or even something close to neutral. It’s chewing me up.
*Something sounds weird...* What is that...?
*The front tyre??*
Nah. Nah *don’t*...
There’s a weird pitched noise coming from the front of the bike somewhere. Unusual; the only thing out there is the bloody tyre...
Shit no. Please *no*.
I snap my head the handlebars to get a look. I can’t see well enough without risking binning it off a bad bounce.
For the umpteenth time I pull over to take a look.
The nobs of the tyre should be spread out like a well cut mango. But they’re squashing together just *a bit* more than normal.
Oh fuck no. Jesus please no. *No no no...*
I vault off the bike and attack the wheel with my thumbs.
"*FUCK!*"
Puncture. Small one, early signs. But a puncture.
My head dumps what it’s got left of the “oh fuck we’re fucked!” chemicals into the system for the last hurrah.
I’m ready to cry. Again.
Again, I can’t.
*Why is this happening?* I’m supposed to be two hundred clicks further down the tarmac road by now!
My head’s a blinded mess from the adrenaline, I can’t think it out. I can't think out the scenarios.
It’s all just rubbish and the word “FUCK” on a loop...
I breathe. Try to push back the already rampant panic.
But the horse has bolted.
*How far back was that last village?*
Or do I ride on to the next one?
Ride on?
Tomboco?
Can I ride on and just pump it up when it needs it??
For an hour and a half? In the dark? *Are you retarded?*
*Water.*
It cuts through the mess.
All that matters is getting water. The rest is, really, just details.
How far back was that last village??
Dunno.
Can’t be more than ten clicks... Maximum. Maybe?
I could head back to that last village and get someone to boil me up some of their water from the well, cross my fingers, and sleep on the floor of someone’s hut.
Suboptimal.
But I should make out.
What else?
Camp *here*?
There’s nowhere to do that. It’s all thick, tall, reedy, stiff grass out here. As high as my head. And no water.
What else...?
Errrrr. Nope. Nothing.
The last village then...
Fuck it. Let’s do that.
I’ll ride back as far as I can before I shred the tyre or the bike becomes unrideable, I’ll walk the rest.
With luck, I’ll get close enough to be able to walk my stuff.
Go.
I vault on and peel out.
The bike’s still managing to perform, the handling is still there, still enough. I ride as hard as I can, as fast as the bike will let me.
Reckless.
Fuck staying calm. Calm left off a *long* way back...
I go dizzy, blurry.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
---
We made it.
Somehow...
It's weird. We *shouldn't* have...
The local mob look at me oddly while I feverishly inspect the front tyre. I don’t think they expected me to be coming back.
The tyre’s *fine*. Seems to be holding up, no problem.
It shouldn’t be able to hold pressure like this... Punctured tyres go flat, fast.
*So what’s going on?*
Am I jumping at shadows?
So. If nothing’s changed... can I keep going?
*No*. In that moment I saw the flat tyre I let go of Tomboco. I can’t get it back.
Mentally, I can't. The full reality of the consequences of having a puncture – at this time of day, with no water – was fully brought home to me.
I’m *done*.
Cooked.
---
I try to strike up a conversation with the locals, who have formed a small mob.
“Bonjour! Sa va?”
They all look back at me like I just farted.
There’s some confused muttering...
Oh! Portuguese! Right! *God damn it*. Can I catch a fucking break!?
Engage the brain.
“Uh, bom, uuuh, bom dia! Uh... com esta?”
“Bar bar bar bar bar bar bar bar...”
*Shit.*
I can’t do this. I’m not nearly crisp enough for this.
“Uh... Saber, France-ay?”
“Neow”. *No.*
*Shit.*
Someone gives me the international hand sign for "one moment" and goes running off; hopefully they'll bring back someone who speaks French...
Charades for now.
I try to get across that the bike's fucked (not 100% true...) and that I need somewhere to sleep.
It takes a goddamn age; no one's picking up what I'm putting down.
The "one moment" person comes running back with a French speaker. Huzzah! I ask where I can stay the night and he say's we need to ask the village chief for permission.
That's a first...
---
We find the chief, sitting with some mates out the front of his hut. The French speaker goes in to bat on my behalf.
Big thumbs up from the chief. Excellent!
I figure from the chat and the gesturing that he wants me to stay with him and his family in his hut.
It's a really nice gesture. But I don't want to look like a dill because I'm putting up a mosquito net inside their house; there's something that seems wrong about that... But, by the same token, I also don't want to get eaten by mosquitoes and get malaria in the night - which would be delightful out here - just for fear of looking like a dill. Either way I'm in the shit.
I try to explain to my old mate that that’s really super nice, and I’m very grateful, but I’ll be happy setting up the tent out the front of his house.
He’s unoffended and cool with it. Bonus.
Don't ask my why, but my desire to get my tent up overrides my crushing thirst. It makes no sense, but for some reason I can't move onto anything else before the tent is done.
I quickly get to work.
News spreads fast, and before long every kid in the village has shown up to watch me do my thing, and a fair few adults too. I don’t reckon they’d have ever seen anything of the likes of a tent before, or someone like me... so I make a bit of a song and dance of it.
The kids are simultaneously intrigued, fascinated and *terrified* of me all at once. Whenever I get close they all go scattering off, *screaming*, freaking out. Slowly they come back to watch again.
I’m exhausted and filthy, I don't blame them for being scared...
In the process of putting up the tent I meet the chief’s son, who kind of speaks French and is around my age, so he takes up the mantle to be my makeshift conduit to communicate with the mob. There's lots of questions and answers.
I finish the job and quickly get onto the water question with my translator.
Neither of us can really articulate it, but he tells me to follow him.
We walk all the way to the other side of the village.
Tucked in behind a couple of other huts is the world’s smallest corner store...
It’s just a couple of dusty shelves with some weathered and bashed knick-knacks from western civilisation. The son-of-chief and the proprietor have a conversation in Portuguese, and, like magic, the boss pulls a carton of *six* dusty, old bottles of water down from the shelf.
Just like that - as I greedily slug down a whole bottle before I've even paid - the nightmare is in the books.
Water never tasted so good...
It's *done*.
Ancient history.
It’s going to be ok.

## Chapter Three
Everyone’s very welcoming here, *super* nice; all smiles.
They seem genuinely happy to have me, and I’m thrilled to be here.
With a couple of bottles of water in the system I’m feeling much better than I was.
This is a million times better than being on the road; puncture or not...
Even though it was only an hour ago, it feels *insane* that I was going to try to make Tomboco in the dark instead of just doing *this* instead.
With my brain working again, my best bet for what made me think the front tyre was "punctured" is that by going through a puddle of water the tyre got cold and "shrunk" bit, making it appear to be a little deflated. In any case, there's no puncture, so it seems...
The sun sets, and the world quickly goes dark.
The chief invites me into the hut with the family and, I’m guessing, a few friends who want to keep talking. There are a handful of the men sitting at the round table and the women and kids are sitting on the hard mud floor. The whole room is barely lit at all by the single lamp in the corner, and we talk in the shadows.
We talk and talk and talk, with a poster of the president of Angola high on the mud wall, overlooking the chatter.
Every-now-and-again a kid walks in through the front “door” (a door sized hole in the front wall of the mud hut) and passes out on the hard mud floor - passes out *cold* - without a word, while the rest of us talk and laugh.
There’s a woman sitting on a crate close-by me. I think I’m falling in love with her.
She’s flat-out beautiful. *Stunning*.
She’s got a smile that’s never seen a dentist’s drill but somehow lights up the whole dim room, I find myself grinning back at her like an idiot - with two front teeth that aren’t even mine.
I’m a sexual racist - I’ll admit it. Other people might call that *having a type*, but that’s just sugar-coating it, what a type is is a lighter form of racism, but racism none-the-less.
I'm not attracted to Africans. There it is... I’ve met some blokes in passing on this trip who go *absolutely gaga* for the women on this continent. *Completely bonkers*.
I’ve got no idea what they’re talking about...
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and my eyes have seen – in months and months – as many women I find attractive as I can count on my fingers. I've met only one that I’d say was *beautiful*.
Which makes this smiling stunner all the more impressive.
Her open, easy-to-smile and quick-to-laugh face has *never* seen makeup before. It’s beauty in its rawest form.
She has me absolutely gobsmacked.
I am falling in love...
Or I might be still on an endorphin high; I think I love *everyone* in this room...
I have to focus to stay on conversation - which is mostly about football and my trip. *Everyone* loves the Shrike.
They eat up my stories. Everyone’s been incredibly welcoming and so kind, it’s hospitality at its most genuine; they seem stoked to have me as their guest in their hut, which is surprising and delighting.
They invite me to stay for dinner. I’ve gotta be honest, I was hoping they’d ask. A candlelit dinner.
How romantic.
On the menu is fufu and mystery meat in mystery sauce.
Fufu - besides being a hilarious name - is a sort of a root or something which they pulverise with a big stick in a bowl, like they’re digging a hole for a fence post. They do this all bloody day till, finally, it’s somehow got the consistency of thick, uncooked bread dough.
The smell of the mystery meat and sauce is too much for me.
The first mouthful...
*Nirvana*. I stop chewing. I feel like I’m having a holy, out of body experience. 
It might just be the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my life.
It’s *perfect*. It just feels so wholesome.
Just what I’ve needed.
I’m gushing with praise, I don't have enough French superlatives for this...
Another young lady sitting on the floor is absolutely *rapt* with the compliments when son-of-chief translates for the group. She gets up and skips out of the front “door” and tells some unseen person outside the hut all about it, like I'm the bloke giving out Michelin stars.
We all talk for hours.
I think it might be my favourite night of the whole trip.
It feels like I’m with family, and I don’t know anyone’s name... 
The smiling stunner wants to learn some English. She wants to learn how to say what I've been saying - *aujoudwee jay oon grand problem* - in English.
Hearing her say “Today, I have, big problem!”, with a big smile on her face, and, yep, I’m in love...
I’m afraid it’s going to be purely platonic. I’m a grub. Filthy and *sticky* and just, well, *grubby*.
Late into the night and my eyes are starting to roll into the back of my head by themselves. I thank my hosts for the best night of my trip, and head to my tent.
Sticky and disgusting, I lie flat-backed on the hard packed mud floor.
That second “puncture” might be the best thing to ever happen to me...
I immediately conk.

## Chapter Four
*Loud noise*.
*Right in my ear*.
I bolt upright. Eyes wild. Adrenaline dumping.
Tent...
*Angola*.
Rooster?
*Fuck it.*
Fuck you. Fucking rooster.
I unclench. Slowly.
Cocker-doodle-fuckin-doo.
The rest of the roosters in the tree next to the tent take up the chorus. I think they were all as surprised as I was... There must be a whole fucking flock of the bastards. It’s still near pitch in the middle of the chilly night. Christ knows what time, but it’s nowhere *near* dawn.
I roll back down to sleep.
---
Loud noise.
"*Argh!*"
Damn that fucking retarded rooster!
This is the third time that bastard has woken me up.
The rest of the bastards are cutting sick with the premature chorus.
It's like they're doing it *right in my ear*.
*Jesus!*
I’m going to find that bastard and wring his neck...
---
Again...
Fucker.
This time, it’s a little lighter out.
Dawn. *Must be.*
I lie still...
The roosters won’t stop.
Now it’s goats. Right outside my tent. Bleating like crazy.
Nature’s alarm clock.
There’s no staying asleep anymore.
My body’s in rigor mortis. It takes time to move even an inch.
Bleary eyed, I poke my head out of the tent.
The chief is sitting outside on a chair. I think he’s got the same problem as I do. Either that or he’s been waiting for me to get up for a chat.
"Ola..."
First things first though; I head to The Shrike.
The front tyre seems fine. So does the back, for that matter... 
I give my second last banana to the chief, and we both have breakfast.
The chief watches me while I strike camp.
I go and take a shit over the back of the village in the bush somewhere.
We’re good to go...
I won’t lie, I’m nervous about today. Nervous about the last thirty clicks.
*Scared*.
I just want to throw the bike into the back of a truck or something and be a passenger.
I’m so tired of worrying.
But, I satisfy myself with saying that it doesn’t matter if it takes me the whole day; all that matters is that I make it the next thirty. That’s enough.
Take it easy.
I fire up as quietly as I can - which is fucking loud - and peel out.
---
As the kilometres and time tick by I feel like I’m on a treadmill. Tomboco seems to get further and further away.
All stretched again. Skewed. Fucked up.
I’m terrified.
So bloody scared.
Every second is an almost physical effort to suppress the panic. The closer I get, the more panicked I feel. It just keeps building up on me till it’s too much.
I can’t *focus*.
The breaks have to come more and more often.
In the end I’m breaking every few kilometres to take a walk and compose myself.
To try to calm down.
To check the tyres.
It’s a tiny, infinite nightmare.
---
Till it’s not...
*There* it is...
Tarmac.
Blacktop. Assfalto.
Return of the ‘mac.
Euphoria. Pure elation.
I’m overwhelmed. Overcome.
It’s *over*.
I take a moment or two at my “border”. I walk about for a bit and I soak it all up.
I get back on the Shrike and we cross the threshold.
Unbidden, I find myself screaming in my helmet.
*Roaring*.
Over and over again with *all* the air in my lungs.
Like an animal.
I don’t know how many times, or for how long...
But I let it all out.
I roar into the helmet till I'm hoarse.
And then I roar some more.
I tell it to the trees.
It's *done.*

## Chapter Five
Straight, good tarmac.
We’re flying. It feels great.
So *easy*.
There are forests of baobab trees. Or is it boab? Anyway, they're everywhere. They have to be the ugliest trees in all the world. Pear shaped. Leafless. Ghostly white. If you like boabaobab trees then you'll like Angola.
Now that there’s nothing to be worried about anymore, I find *new* things to stress over.
*There’s always something.*
I’m worried that my battered, smashed, worn-down-to-the-canvas tyres are going to give up the ghost and shred themselves to pieces on the tarmac.
It wouldn’t surprise me; they really do look like they’ve been through hell.
The road has taken me west all the way to the coast, and now I'm heading south to the capital, Luanda. There’s so much mileage to cover; with only four days including today of my visa to make it to the border it feel like I’m playing a dangerous game of catch-up.
---
Twilight on the outskirts of Luanda, and I have to stop. 
It's late, again. I’ve exhausted myself, again.
I’m bonking out.
I take a room, the only option I can find. It's frighteningly expensive but at least it it has a shower and a clean bed, which, after the last few days, feels like utter luxury.
Once I've recovered some energy I sit down and do the math, but it's only telling me what I already know: I won't make it to the border; it's simply a bridge too far. So, the next challenge becomes somehow extending my transit visa. But today is Friday, which means anything bureaucratic will be closed tomorrow and the next day, which means I've shot my powder for nothing...
*Fuck.*
Do I wait around till Monday? My visa expires on Monday... Then what? What if they reject me? What then?
Then I’ll be in deep shit. *Really* deep shit.
I’m going to have to crack on.
But not with these tyres... They won't survive high speed tarmac. No way, José.
Well. Fuck it all. I’m going for a shower and a sleep. In a *bed*.
I’m fucking disgusting.
---
Luanda.
Morning.
I've decided to just blow out the visa.
Fuck it.
Over the last couple of days I've put new boots on the Shrike. In the end I didn’t get anything like what I wanted; I’ve got a road tyre on the front, and a knobbly offroad tyre on the back.
The poor fucker looks confused.
All and sundry have told me that all the roads south of here are all good tarmac, that I won't need offroad tyres. But I’ve been told that before... And I got my pants pulled down.
The idea of getting reamed, *again*, by an unexpected offroad clusterfuck has got me agitated. The idea of getting stuck out there with a slippery road tyre on the front and some shitty Chinese piece of shit tyre on the back has got me having kittens.
But that’s all that they’ve got. That’s all that *anyone’s* got.
It took another day and night burnt that I couldn’t afford; three days of my five day visa are already in the can, and that’s to Luanda... *And that ain’t shit*.
Getting to the border in two day’s just ain’t gonna happen.
Not on an Enfield.
In the context of five days, and an Enfield, the distances required are enormous.
From what I can tell from the maps, there’s not a whole lot of anything between towns, and the distances between them are, well, it’ll take me a full day to get from one to another.
Even on good roads.
There are villages, of course, but not villages where they have anything they can sell you, or anywhere you can sleep. If what I’ve seen so far is anything to go by then there’s practically zero commerce; no business. For my purposes, they might as well not even be there; I’ve got to make it from one town to the next.
Angola, top to bottom, you’re looking at a distance about the same as London to Madrid, or, for the yanks, Minneapolis to Dallas, or for the Aussies, about half way in.
It wouldn't be much of a drama on a road hog, sure, but on a machine that averages a *net* speed of somewhere around fifty clicks an hour, you’re looking at a shitload of hours.
The visa’s gonna get blown. Big time. And I don’t know what that means, or what to do about it.
---
Out of Luanda and onto the coast road.
It's *sensational*.
Big cliffs edging into an angry looking ocean.
The smell of salt is in my nose.
It's my kind of ride.
Since leaving the dirt road behind I’ve traded one hazard for another: I’m too slow.
*Way* too slow.
The traffic is sparse, but what traffic there is all seems to want to kill me. The speed limit here is 120 clicks, but that only seems to be a recommendation... I know that by maxing out the Shrike at eighty I'm well under the limit, but everyone else is a long, *long* way over it.
I wonder if it’s some sort of game they’re having, to see how close they can get to me as they go whipping past, buffeting me with the air pressure built up by all that speed.
Anyway, I try not to let the near-death experiences get in the way of a good time.
The sun’s out but somehow the air’s managing to remain crisp and cool, something I haven’t felt in what feels like a very long time.
It’s almost *chilly*.
I can ride with my leather jacket zipped to the neck for the first time in, well, *this side of the Sahara*.
---
The trees thin out and then disappear altogether.
Things turn a little arid. Looking left, it looks like I'm on some sort of high altitude plateau. *Sparse*.
---
The road tears itself away from the coast and the scenery gets lumpy and a little stranger, like it doesn’t know what it wants to be; stuck between grass and sand.
The hilly blacktop allows me to do something I don’t often get the chance to do; listen to how the bike is rolling without the engine on. I figure I can listen out for what’s going on with the wheels and tyres and chains and brakes and whatever without the engine and exhaust drowning it all out.
So, at the crest of a hill I find neutral and let the momentum take us over the top and we start to coast into the long descent.
I turn the key off.
It’s weird. So quiet.
Just the wind whirling around the helmet and the light tyre noise from where the rubber meets the road.
It’s all quite peaceful.
Everything sounds just like it should.
I wonder if this is what a tour on a bicycle would feel like...
It'd be nice.
I lightly move onto the brakes at the bottom of the hill. The brake pads are a bit whirry sounding, but they work.
I stomp on the gears with a crunch, and first gear slams into place.
*FUCK!!*
What the fuck did I do that for???
Pure, bloody, retarded habit. A reflex action from hundreds of times of bringing the bike to rest.
Utterly unconscious.
"IDIOT!!!"
The whole bike violently shudders.
The bike lurches, with the engine turning over dead once, twice, three times before I grab a fistful of everything; clutch, brakes, and slam my foot down on the rear brake.
The whole thing comes to a stuttering stop.
"Fucking MORON!!"
I vault off the bike and I don’t know what I should look at first. All that I could have just shredded to little metallic pieces is all *inside* the bike somewhere.
So, I look where I always look; where the oil normally comes out from that ongoing leak that I've had since back in France.
I have to almost lie on my face to see it.
There’s a lot more oil than there ought to be.
*A lot* more.
I grab a rag and wipe the oil away and a fresh gush of oil comes oozing out to replace it immediately.
Ohh shit.
You’re fucked.
I’m fucked.
I’ve fucked it, completely.
I’ve killed it.
I’ve murdered the bike because I’m a fucking idiot.
I’ve blown a seal. Must be. That’d explain the oil... I’ve blown it badly enough that The Shrike will bleed out. Quickly.
God only knows what’s happened inside that engine cover...
Fucking hell.
*What do I do now?*
How do I replace a seal out here? How do I even find the seal I need?
That’ll take *weeks* to ship in.
My visa runs out *tomorrow*.
I was supposed to somehow extend it at the next town. That’s still another half a day's ride away.
I don’t have any oil to top up as I go. And I don’t have anywhere to buy any.
Jesus tap-dancing *Christ*.
Angola was supposed to be *easy* for fuck’s sake.
Do I put in on a truck?
*What truck?*
Fucking hell, why the fuck did I even go near the gears?! Without the clutch even? What was I *thinking??*
What to do now then?
I guess there’s not really an option. Right? Keep going and see what happens...
The worst thing that can happen, I think, is that the oil sump leaks dry and then the engine parts don’t get oil and then the whole thing really, really dies. Which isn’t a whole lot worse than the current situation...
If I can find oil, I can replace it as I lose it. It might suck, but it might get me to the next town, if the leak rate isn't "haemorrhage".
I clean up the oil pool as best I can with my filthy rag and check the oil level on the sight glass, which is on the same engine case. It’s a bit more than halfway up. So long as I keep an eagle eye on that, it shouldn’t come to an oil-less death.
I jump on and hit the ignition with fingers crossed.
The Shrike starts.
Goes into gear as well.
I ride a few minutes up the road, pull over, turn it all off and recheck everything.
The flow seems to be pretty heavy. The oil sight is at halfway.
Rinse and repeat.
---
Every few minutes for the next *fifty* kilometres, I pull over and make a check.
It’s a slow grind. I’m right on edge. But, more and more, I reckon that it can’t be something serious, otherwise it wouldn’t have made it this far...
The saddlebags are a mess of oil. The shit's sprayed everywhere.
I check in at a lone petrol station. They should have oil, but they don't.
Nothing close to the spec that I need anyway. I don't know what the rules are for putting off spec oil into a motorbike...
I head back to The Shrike and check the oil level before I head off again.
It’s empty...
Completely *empty*.
*Panic*.
I grab the bike and tilt it heavily over towards me, as far as I dare without risking it falling on top of me, to see just how far from the bottom of the sight glass the oil level was.
There's nothing. Even leaning over this far on the piss, not a drop of oil is on the sight glass.
It's bone dry...
I won't be able to replace the oil as fast as I'm losing it; it's bled a couple of litres in fifty clicks. There’s *a thousand* clicks to the border.
Pure, bloody, panic.
I *have* to repair it.
But I can’t.
A nightmare is brewing...
*Angola wasn’t supposed to be like this!!*
---
I'm going to keep riding.
Like a fucking idiot.
I’m going to ride on.
I know I’m an idiot.
I know it.
But it’s what I’m doing.
Where are my keys?
I always keep them in my jacket pocket. *Always*.
*Where are they??*
I look all over the bike. Not there.
On the ground. Not there.
In the petrol station. Not there.
I look in the places I’ve already looked, I know they're not going to be there.
I’m ready to cry. I can feel it. All that shit and now I’ve lost my fucking keys. It’s just one thing after the other. I feel just like a kid who’s dead tired and knows they’re being absurd, but I want to cry anyway.
I can’t deal.
There’s nothing to do but keep looking.
I want to look inside my bags, but that’s retarded; I haven’t opened them.
*Where the fuck are they??*
I look everywhere - even the retarded places. I ask everyone at the servo if they’ve seen them.
Have they been *stolen*?
Nope; they’re in the bottom of the water bottle pocket of my saddlebags.
I don’t remember putting them there.
I’ve never *once* put them there.
Being this wound up is making me do stupid shit.
This is *the pits*.
I’m a whimpering mess. I hit the ignition and ride on.
The last hurrah.
*Desperate*.
I can’t handle the idea of coming this far, being through so much, only for things to go so thoroughly balls up when it was supposed to be *easy*.
When it *is* easy.
One moment of madness... One braindead move and now it's an ordeal.
---
We make it to the next petrol station down the road. I've no idea how.
A long ride - at least it felt that way...
I head into the shop and they’ve got bottled oil, but it’s a long way off spec for the bike.
Sub-optimal, and it might kill the Shrike anyway, but beggars can’t be choosers...
I head back to the bike and squat down to add all of the oil in.
The sight glass is black...
*What?*
I tilt my head down to look at it on the same level.
Half full.
Normal level.
*What the fuck?* Where did all *that* come from??
*"What’s going on here??"*
I’m so confused. One moment the bike’s on its last legs, the next, no problem.
Ride on, then?
I'm lost.
---
I pull into a village called Sumbe.
My head's a blur.
In places all throughout the town the side roads are completely flooded and impassable.
*Inundated* is the word.
It doesn't seem like it's rained lately...
Suddenly, it’s like someone just farted in my open mouth. I shake my head in my helmet like someone’s just slapped me.
The unmistakable smell of *human* shit. No doubt.
Flooding the streets.
Deeee-lightful.
Nothing like flooded sewers to say welcome to the town...
It'll still have to do for the day. I can't go on.
I'm into the guts of the place and, as usual, I’m spending as much time looking ahead as I am looking in my rear-view mirrors; safety first.
A ute comes up close behind me, *very* close, pulls out to overtake, draws up halfway alongside, and then cuts back into my lane and drives right over the top of me, slamming me off the road.
I lose control of the bike, forced into the gutter and just about go flying over the steep verge, I just manage to get it level and bring it back without binning it, and I bounce back onto the road.
I’m screaming at the bastard. Fucking *furious*.
Cunt nearly wiped me out. *Should have* wiped me out. How the fuck did that work in his head? I’d get it if *I* was overtaking *him*, but *he* pulled out to overtake *me*. Just a second ago!
*Moron!*
The pure… *negligence*!
He pulls to the side to stop and I do the same.
*I’m not sure what I’m going to do.*
I don’t think I’ve ever been this angry in my life.
I whip my helmet off.
My jaw’s locked and all the hot fury’s gone cold.
I’ve never hit anyone in my life either. Not in anger...
He gets out of the car and takes one look at me and he looks about as sheepish as you can get.
I can’t understand a word of what he’s saying.
I'm verbally hosing him down.
I know he can't get a word of what I’m saying, but I know that he’s sorry. It was an accident. But I'm too far gone.
I need to vent it all off.
Cathartic. This dumb fucker gets to be my verbal punching bag for what feels like a lifetime of pent up juice.
The poor little bastard’s petrified.
I’m still not satisfied.
I want to punch something. I don’t know. His car maybe...
But that’s enough.
I walk off steaming back towards the bike and wave him off.
The Shrike’s fine.
In a manner of speaking...
It’s been a day of abuse for the poor thing, and it’s already done so much.
The “crash bar’s”, which protect the bike have, surprise surprise, protected the bike.
It’s the other side to the one that got warped from that wanker reversing over it in Nigeria. With a good kicking to straighten things out they start to look like a match.
Get me a hotel. Stat. I need to lie down.
---
Six hours in the saddle is a few too many. I’m knackered and out of it when I head out of my room to go get a second lunch, which, if we’re honest, is more like first lunch.
The other attempted lunch on the road was “carne”, which, I’m guessing is where "chilli con carne" would come from, so I guess that it just means "meat". But to call it meat would be kind. It was, literally, like chewing an old boot; Didn’t matter how much teeth I put into it, I never got to the point of being ok with swallowing the bloody stuff. Unchewable.
About halfway into the plate my jaw wouldn’t work anymore. Aching, tight and buggered. So I ended up having to eat the rest of my fill with all the elegance of a seagull trying to swallow a chip.
Not pretty.
700 kwanza. Haggled. That’s north of seven bucks. *Madness*.
Anyway. For second lunch there are no options. Street food isn’t a thing here in Angola, and neither is normal food, for that matter.
After a fair bit of walking around I settle for a place that’s selling pastries - of all things - and quaff a few of those.
Out of nowhere I almost black out.
I grab the table I’m standing near to straighten up.
My head’s all over the place as the world cartwheels.
My adrenaline gets jacked and my head fizzes like it's sherbet.
I shove what’s left of the doughnuts into my face and scurry off to the hotel room to lie flat. 
---
So. I’m still sick.
Or am I just tired? Or is that all it is?
I don’t know. I’m sick of guessing at what’s making me sick.
*This day’s been too long.*
I call it a day early, I skip dinner, and fall asleep under the mickey mouse printed sheets in my crappy hotel room that cost me 5,000 kwanza. North of 50 bucks and it has only a bucket to shower with...
*Outrageous.*
I hate this place.
Angola’s going to be the death of me.
It’s chilly outside.
I miss *Africa* Africa.

Marathon. You have your preparation and planning, where you do whatever you can to make a good result. The gun goes off. You wonder just what the hell you've gotten yourself into. The many miles ahead seem daunting and intimidating and you're nervous as hell. You hit your rhythm, you enjoy yourself and you're comfortable. You get halfway and the finish line seems to be right there. It's easy. All thoughts go to the finish line and you want to accelerate. It's an illusion. A mirage. The finish line is still a massive distance away and the hardest yards are still ahead of you. The thought of the finish line and the focus on that and the belief that it's all already in the bag lead to the next stage - Things get tough. You should have been ready for it but you were too busy being excited about the finish line. This isn't easy. It hurts. It's terrifying. Despair, helplessness, self-pity and failure are all on the doorstep. Self-pity, isn't on the doorstep actually, it's all you can think of. Small things not going right are magnified out of their proper proportion and things are at risk of unravelling unless you take the reins and get control and get it done. That's where I'm at. I know what comes next in a marathon: The thought of the finish line goes from being "right there" to being an infinite distance away. Instead of mentally chewing the whole remaining distance to the finish line in one hit (which leads to a breakdown) you cut it up into pieces that you can manage and then you just chew. All you can do here is put one step in front of the other. It's brutally painful while it lasts, and time draws out like an asymptote. But, eventually it's over, and the feeling is bittersweet. Learn from your experience, stop thinking about Cape Town. Don't even think about Namibia. Keep your thoughts under control, ignore that oil leak (screaming quad muscle) and the wondering about your health (that crushing exhaustion) and get the job done. Let's make this a workman like performance. This is your chance to build your character to the next level. Let’s learn some things outside of the comfort zone while we're here, and build the man you can be. I haven't been for a run since Morocco, yet I'm still running marathons. This is my jam, this is my shtick, this is what I do. This is where I'm at my best. This is my element. I won’t be beaten.

## Chapter Six
Day five.
The last day of my valid visa. After this, I’m not allowed to be here.
I’m not sure what that means. Am I a fugitive?
I need to get an extension...
To add insult to injury, all this processed food I've been eating has given me the squirts.
In spite of the ever-present danger, I head the long walk to the “Imigracao” to chance my arm.
---
Cue a long, long wait.
Finally I get an audience. And not a moment too soon; things are getting loose...
I get told that they can do it; they can get me an extension.
I fill out the papers and they tell me to go and make a 9,000 kwanza deposit (100 plus bucks) into *two* different bank accounts and they'll stamp me in when that's done. Expensive, sure, but it's better than getting in deep shit later.
I ask how long the extension is for.
They don't know.
They check.
Then they change their mind: They can’t do extensions on “transit” visas. Impossible. Apparently.
They won’t bend the rules for me.
I plead.
They won't budge.
What a clusterfizzer.
They tell me to go to the border. *It’ll be fine*, they say. But I’m not cool with that; what border official worth his salt wouldn’t put me over the barrel for that? I should be so lucky if that’s all I cop, I can think of ways it could go *much* worse. After that shit with the Liberians, I'm not willing to tempt fate.
I nag. And nag, and nag, and nag.
I grind them out till I manage to convince one of the underlings to write me up what’s basically a “please excuse my son from Phys Ed because...” note.
I’ll be buggered if I know what it says; it’s all in Portuguese.
But it’s missing a signature or a stamp, and that won’t do; I’ve learned on the way that people will bow to anything that looks official enough, and this won't pass muster.
The minion says he won’t do a stamp or signature; it might get him in the shit with the boss.
So I ask to see the boss...
---
Two hour wait.
Just staring at a fucking wall, sitting on a flight of stairs.
I'm going to shit *everywhere*.
I’m getting flashbacks of that boat in Bissau. That plank of wood...
Finally, the boss will see me.
I head into his office and explain the situation as quickly as I can.
He's cool with it.
*Yipee.*
I get a sheet of paper that’s looks the business, nice and official. It’ll do. And if it works, it would have saved me a hundred bucks. If it doesn’t work, well, I don't care anymore.
I run, mostly from the knees down, back to the hotel.
*Whoosh.*
---
I find a burger joint for dinner.
*Bowels be damned.*
It’s weird. It’s wonderful. It’s awful.
On the surface, it seems odd to think of it as a downgrade, but it is. I’ve substituted mystery meat that is fresh with a high rate of turnover to mystery burger meat, which is, arguably, more mysterious, and who-knows how old.
I don’t see anyone else eating this shit... Red flags. 
---
Day six.
I feel like a criminal.
Like there’s some sort of manhunt underway for a dishevelled looking, scared white guy on a beaten to hell ancient looking pair of wheels.
Runaway.
I’m not sure I can pull this off...
But, I’m buoyed by the fact that I’m pretty sure I can pull off today’s short ride. It’s the bridging gap-day that had to happen; my choices are to go the short two hundred clicks to a middling village, or go long, five hundred and fifty clicks the next town along, called Lubango. Piss on that.
My attitude to the world has taken a turn. My perspective's different.
I’ve zoomed out.
I've zoomed out *a lot.*
I've landed on the attitude of “fuck it”.
*Fuck it.*
I’ve been reading a bit too heavily on Marcus Aurelius lately, and summarised it all into those two eloquent words.
Fuck it: I don’t care if the bike dies today. I don’t need it. I don’t *need* anything.
I don’t need *me*, even.
So what?
So what if whatever’s been fucking with me for these last two months decides to end the game and kill me? *So what?*
This “puny arena of humanity”, in all the immensity of time and space; when you zoom all the way out on both scales, where does that leave you?
How can I seriously be taking any of this seriously?
Shadows and dust. All of it. *Everything.*
*Fuck it.*
On the topic of fucking things; *Fuck Angola*.
It’s not my Africa; I want my Africa back.
I officially don’t like it here.
I haven’t liked it for the last couple of days.
This is a different world.
It's all I’ve wanted, *all I’ve been hankering for*, and it’s all finally here. But, as soon as I’ve got it, I don’t want it any more. I’m John Dorian and this Africa is my Elliot Reid...
I’ve got pizza and burgers, but I don’t want that anymore. I’ve got tarmac, mind-blowingly, brain-destroyingly gun-barrel-straight, featureless tarmac. *All I wanted*.
I don’t want it anymore.
I wonder if everything in my life I’ve ever wanted has been like this. You want something so bad, and then it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.
Angola, the place I’ve worked *so hard* to get into.
This place, it’s unrecognisable.
It doesn’t *fit.*
All of my Africa - this side of the Sahara desert - has all been variations on a theme. Things change, but they all stay the same; It’s all *Africa*.
This is different.
It’s like a cheap imitation of cheap American shit to appease the zombie hoard of expats chasing a buck; they’re everywhere. Oil and diamonds will do that.
It makes me cringe.
It’s the culture shock that I wasn’t expecting. Not one bit. And it’s hard to adjust.
Everyone wants what they can’t have...
I’ve wanted it for months!!
I want *interesting derelictness* back. I want *rough* back. I want *grimy* back.
Culture isn’t even the half of it; *Everything’s* changed.
The depth of green has been slowly fading out from the forests of Gabon and through the grasslands of the Congo’s till now, finally, everything’s turned yellow. Not cool, interesting yellow either.
Bland.
Martian.
A Marscape.
*There’s nothing to see;* blank, boring landscapes as far as the eye can see.
The places are so thoroughly poor, in every way. So run down and derelict and just sad looking. The huts and houses, the same colour of the yellow limestone looking mountains, look like they’re grown there, rather than built there. They look like ant colonies, or a wasps nest.
There's no colour. No smiling.
The kwanza is *killing* me. The currency here. My god. It’s going to do me in. Gone are the day’s I could get by on a daily spend of something between ten and twenty bucks. A bottle of water’s costing me *four* bucks, for what used to cost two cents.
It’s a fucking outrage.
I blame the expats. It’s out of control.
Luanda, the capital, was gorgeous, modern, clean(ish), full of sky scrapers, it’s got a beautiful esplanade that falls right out onto a really nice beach. It’s cashed up and going places. There’s even an epic, massive, rocketship-like monument there that looks like a Soviet’s wet dream. It looks like something I’d build on Red Alert that would, I don’t know, electrocute Marines. It’s looks gratuitously expensive and artfully pointless.
All that money.
But the villages... *Jesus.* They’re the poorest I’ve seen so far on the way down.
The poorest by a fair margin, too.
These poor bastards look like they’re on subsistence living. Or worse. I’ve never seen such a sharp line drawn between the have's and the have not’s.
Seriously: they've got fuck all.
Did I mention that it’s as cold as a witch’s tit? I’m freezing my plums off.
The sun is blazing bright overhead, we’re not at high altitude, but I can’t feel my ring and pinkie fingers, they're in a state of constant numbness from lack of blood flow. They've stopped working properly.
Tomorrow I’m going to wear a jumper.
A couple of days ago I was a dehydrated sweating mess, and now I'm so cold I can't feel my fingers.
Where the fuck are we? Are we still in Africa? Could’ve fooled me...
I’m sick of this joint.
Except for the sprung mattresses. And the hot showers. And rooms that don’t look like they’ve been freshly fucked in.
I’ll keep those.
The oil leak is driving me mad, fuck-it-attitude or not.
I guess that even through the leak is making a mess of everything, spraying oil everywhere all over my bags and bike and even me, it’s low enough to be manageable with top ups - I think. It's a crapshoot trying to judge by the oil sight glass. It’s just so fluky.

## Chapter Seven
Into Benguela.
*Traffic lights...*
I find a guesthouse run by an American. Her name is Nancy, and she welcomes me like an old friend.
There are a group of kids glued to the Shrike as I take the shit off the bike for another day.
They jump at the chance to go for a little joyride around the square.
It’s the first time I’ve ridden the bike without a helmet and jacket on.
*This is living.*
This is what riding bike’s was supposed to be about; There’s no helmet muffling the roar and thump of the machine doing its thing, no lid to stop the wind through my hair. It’s a feast for the senses. It’s *freedom*.
I take the kids for a few laps one by one and they’re rapt with it. On the last lap I twist the throttle up a little and the bike misfires; it just skips a beat. I can feel it in a loss of power and hear the gap in the revs, and then it comes back on again, lurching forward like nothing happened.
*It’s never done that before...*
I reckon that’s enough horsing about.
I head into the guesthouse.
There’s a girl. She’s *blond*.
*Blond!*
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a blond person in my *life*.
What a novelty.
I introduce myself in a kind of “your white, I’m white, let’s be white together” kind of way.
She’s from Sweden. *Of course she is*. Swedish and stunning.
How cliché.
So stunning, in fact, that her name goes in one ear and out the other. I give myself an immediate mental kick in the arse - we’re five seconds in and I’ve already botched it.
She’s teaching English here, of all things.
She’s happy to chat.
Even moreso than the blondness, I'm being pulled in by the fact that for the first time in recent history I’m speaking English the way I would back home; not having to modify to make myself understood. It’s glorious. Conversation: So underrated.
It’s been a *long* time.
---
It’s also been a long time between pizzas.
And cheese.
I quaff the cheesiest pizza in the world for dinner and, admittedly, it’s pretty friggin good.
---
Alarm. In a dark room. On a sprung mattress.
Thwack. *Shut up.*
The last 24 hours have been full of “firsts for a long time”, and this one is the least pleasant by far: I don’t want to leave.
I really, really, *really* don’t want to get on that bike. It’s repellent, like trying to push together the wrong ends of a magnet.
I want to stay another day at Nancy’s. It’s been too nice. I’m not ready to leave.
But it’s day *seven*. And that’s enough; *I have no choice...*
I can feel how chilly the air is on the other side of the toasty sheets. *The whole room is freezing.*
But every minute I stay in this warm bed is another minute later that I’ll arrive in Lubango.
It’s that simple.
I get up and get going.
---
It’s cold enough to be heavily foggy. And that’s damn cold.
Jackets and jumpers.
I roll out, heading south east. Inland.
After an hour my fingers and hands have stopped working, and I can’t feel any of my toes.
At around mid-morning the fog decides that it’s at the right temperature to vaporise off, and it all clears in the blink of an eye. It's beautiful to see the sun shine through the clouds, through the mountains.
"GOOD MORNING!!"
I start singing Jesus of Suburbia. Because I can.
All is good in the world.
The bike misfires. *Again.*
I stop singing.
It cuts out and then cuts back in again, jerking me forward and then backwards.
Gives me the heebie jeebies.
What’s going on with the Shrike?
We’ve got a monster day today. *Don’t do this.*
There’s no one out here... Despite the goodish tarmac, the traffic is as sparse as the arid landscape. I’m guessing we're on some sort of high plateau.
The road builders look like they’ve designed the route with a ruler.
Dead straight.
I start to pull the bike over to soak up some sunshine like a lizard on a rock, and maybe get some blood flow back into the extremities.
On the rundown the Shrike just gently, slowly, inexorably dies off by itself till the engine cuts out.
Silence. Dead silence.
Cue panic.
That’s never happened before. *Ever.*
I turn the key off. Then back on. It makes the normal pre-start hums and whirrs and I hit the ignition button.
Starter motor turns. Turns some more. Turning, turning, turning, still turning. No fire. Still turning round. I’m wiggling the throttle trying to catch the sweet spot.
Nothing but the rhythm of the starter.
It’s going to flood… Gonna flood, gonna flood, gonna flood…
Do I stop??
The Shrike splutters into life and then roars as it catches up to where I’ve got the throttle.
*"What the fuck is going on??"*
I leave it revving high till I think it’s done whatever it’s got to do to sort it’s shit out, and then gently roll off the throttle.
It winds down, never stopping where it normally happily idles, and just dies. Again.
My head’s a blur, clutching at straws. I *need* an answer. I need a *why*.
I jump off and do all the usual checks on the bike. I wrack my brains.
I’ve got nothing.
No clue.
But I know that it’s bad. The shit’s going to hit the fan. Soon.
Or now...
I get back on and try to get life back again.
I ride the starter motor and nothing's happening again.
Fuck it’s definitely flooding. I stay with it.
It coughs and putts and then weakly rolls and then roars to life.
I stomp first and go.
---
I don’t stop.
My brain is turning it over faster than the wheels on the tarmac; the backfires, the dying, the oil, the gearbox; but I’m not getting anywhere with it. I’ve really got nothing but a bad vibe and panic. And it’s coming closer...
I have to make a conscious mental effort to stay on top of it, because I can feel that it’s all close to the edge of unravelling. Badly.
I've got practically nothing to worry about these days.
Relatively speaking, I ought to be carefree.
But there’s *always* something.
It's pathetic.
Like worrying whether the tarmac will be excellent or just ok.
*What a joke.*
Now worrying that the Enfield is going to randomly crap out on me for no rhyme or reason.
What is that as a thing to be worried about?
*Ridiculous.*
I’d have thought that all this travelling would make me rise above the petty shit naturally, that I'd have some serious perspective when it comes to angst... But it's still a conscious effort to swat away the small stuff. Maybe it always will be.
But I can't stop it.
It feels harder than it’s ever been.
I’m not sure I’ve ever been more *fragile*. Brittle.
And I’m tired.
Tired of it all.
I pass many villages that look like they might have food. I ride right on by.
This happens *all the time*; unless food hits me in the face, I won’t eat it. It never happens and I know it.
---
So. Skipped lunch again.
Into the afternoon and I’m crapping out. Because of course I am.
Lethargy is coming on bad and I’m actually starting to feel hungry.
And I never feel hungry.
The brief window of warmth in the late-morning has gone back to chilly again.
I can’t focus on anything. Everything is tired from holding this same riding position for hours without break.
I have to stop.
I can’t not.
But I can’t stop either, because The Shrike might never start again...
But, I *can’t* ride for six hours straight either. I can’t do it.
*Can’t.*
We roll down and as we go through the gears, I get down to first, pull the clutch, and hold my breath on the rundown. 
The engine keeps rolling. Idling like there’s no drama.
*No problem.*
I put it into Switzerland and it’s happy there. No worries.
I turn the key off – devil may care – I’ve gotta take a walk to get my head back on my knotted, aching shoulders.
I take my jacket off and my skin isn’t really sure if it’s cold or hot. It’s both and neither. There’s a definite shivering chill in the cold air, but at the same time the sun is radiating down, mercilessly bright and warm. It’s like standing in a fridge with an electric heater a few inches away from your face.
It’s confusing.
Hot in the sun, freezing in the shade.
Back to the bike. It turns three times and then fires. Normal. Perfect.
*No worries.*
What’s going on here? Has it just healed itself? Again?
Was this morning just some kind of abomination then?
Buggered if I know.
Off, then. Again.
---
The damage is done.
Trying to go in the saddle without a break or food has done me in.
The remaining distance and time stretch off to the infinite vanishing point that never seems to get closer. Minutes become small forevers.
Each handful of kilometres feels like the first hundred did.
---
Eightish hours of scared, braindead riding, I cross the town limits of Lubango.
Knackered.
It’s properly cold now. All cold. Although there are no clouds in the sky, the pin pointed, frosty sun is starting to feel every inch of its hundred million miles away.
I don’t like Lubango. It’s a hole. I don’t like the vibe of the place at all.
It’s very big and loud and busy. I’m surprised and jarred by the size and the traffic and the people. What are they all doing, all the way out here?
I don’t like it especially because I can’t find any accommodation. Small villages are never a problem, there’s only a few options - if that. You go there, haggle, and take a room. Easy. Middle and big villages are far, far more difficult. There’s always more variables, and the places to stay always seem to hide themselves in amongst the throng of people and businesses.
Just like now.
I’m running on empty, slumped in the saddle.
I need a place. Quick.
---
I’ve found nothing but deal breakers and exhausting conversation. A mix of Portuguese, French and charades.
An hour of questions with nothing to show for it.
How do you tell someone without using language all the things I want to say?
Do you have a room available?
How much is it?
No that’s too much. It needs to be cheaper.
Can I see it?
Is there somewhere to keep my bike?
No?
Seriously?
Fuck this.
Do you know any other places in the neighbourhood?
Sorry? Where?
What’s it called again?
It's like pulling teeth, and I have to do it every time.
I’m in desperado mode as time ticks and it gets darker and colder, but everywhere I go I cop the same deal breaker; I won’t keep the Shrike on the road overnight. Never done it, never will.
But it’s looking like that’s the only way that I’m going to be able to lie down sometime soon.
And eat.
And that’s becoming more and more important by the minute…
Not to mention putting an end to these maddening conversations. There turning me delirious.
Nah. That’s it. I give up.
I’m heading back to the least expensive place and keeping the bike out front.
I’ve had enough.
---
On the ride back I spot a joint that I didn’t spot before.
It’s seen better days, but I might as well try...
“The Conversation” ensues.
They have somewhere to keep the bike. That’ll do me.
It’ll be 6,500 kwanza. That’s north of seventy bucks. And that’s the haggled price.
Easily the worst value accommodation this side of London.
I don’t give a shit.
I unpack and collapse into the hovel.
---
The sun sets. It quickly gets cold.
Seriously cold.
Frosty, fog-your-breath-in-the-air cold. And I’m *inside*, for Christ sake.
Are we still in friggin Africa or what? I don't have anything for cold like this...
I head to the shower.
Portuguese strikes again; I reckon “F’s” gonna be cold, like the “F for froid” in French, right? But then what’s “Q”?
I give "Q" a long go, but the water's still coming out biting cold. So cold it feels like it’s burning hot.
Gotta be "F" then...
I give it a run and it's just as fucking cold as the "Q".
I let it run for minutes.
Nothing...
I head out to the “admin” and ask about it to a young bloke who’s pulled the night-shift.
And, nope, no hot water.
Seventy bucks a night in a freezing shithole and there's no hot water...
I fly right off the handle; the opposite of impressed.
Second time I’ve vented my spleen this bad in three days.
*I must be tense.*
But fair enough too; this is fucking *bullshit.*
Not here, not now, no way.
If it was cheap and nasty joint then fair enough, or if we were in *Africa* Africa where it’s hotter than the sun, then fair enough too. But in this place, this shitty little hovel, which has cost me a bomb, in this freezing cold dive of a fucking town? It feels too much of an injustice to just let it go and turn the other cheek.
It’s not this poor bastards fault, and I don’t think he can cog much of what I’m driving at either. Fucking Portuguese. Pretty sure he knows I’m well cheesed though.
So I take him back to the room and run the shower taps and then shrug at him, incredulously.
He gives me the international signal to “wait here”; he’s going to do something.
Well, thank fuck for that.
A minute later he comes back into the room holding a kettle.
I have to laugh.
A fucking *kettle.*
Forget about it, mate. No problem.
What a shit end to a rough day.
I try to take a shower, but I can’t. I can’t will myself to do it. Doesn’t matter how gross I am or how much I need it. I’ve taken bucket showers in the Himalayas before, and that was pretty fucking cold, but this is beyond.
Trying to tell my shivering naked body to stand under those icy daggers is like trying to tell your knee not to kick when the doc whacks it with a hammer; the reaction to jerk away is pure reflex.
I hug myself and dance naked from foot to foot, psyching myself up and pep talking the inner monologue not to be a pussy.
Don’t think, just do!
Aaaaaand I wimp out.
Crawl into the thousand layers of dense, old and weathered sheets that look like they came from my Nan's place. I can feel with my feet that the under sheet is shorter than I am.
I hate this place.
I settle in for a grubby sleep.
---
MmmzzzzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz……………zzzzzzzzZZZZzzzz…………ZZZZZ
Fucking parasitic bastard malaria fucker! Been keeping me awake the *whole night*.
I’m tucked tightly under the heavy blankets. My face is *freezing*.
I can hear it but I can’t see it, it’s too dark and the light is all the way over the other side of the room. It’s barely warm even under the sheets. I don’t even dare move even an inch for fear of letting in even the slightest breath of that sub-zero air under the sheets.
Going all the way across the room to turn the light on, and then standing in the middle of the room naked to hunt down a single mosquito? Yeah, not gonna happen.
So instead of exterminating the persistent bastard I’m going to keep letting it eat my face.
I hate this place.

## Chapter Eight
Sun's back.
It’s still early but that’s definitely light.
Day... eight. 
I think it might even be colder now than during the night.
The bathroom’s flooded. The taps have been leaking straight out of the wall, and it looks like the drain won't drain.
I hate this place.
Easily the worst value place on the planet.
Anyway, today’s a big one.
Almost four hundred clicks. 
Gotta get going.
---
The Shike’s not happy with the cold. Nor should it be.
But it starts.
I peel out of town.
Adios, to this utterly charmless pile of shit.
Heading out of town a fighter jet goes screaming low overhead as it takes off from the airport. I don’t get how, with people living this in these conditions, that having *fighter jets* can be a priority for the government. But it’s still a fighter jet, so that’s fucking awesome.
I nearly go clean up a cars arse trying to keep my eye on it as it banks and screams away and over the mountains.
---
Out of the town the road straightens out. And goes super bland.
You couldn’t design a blander road.
The tarmac’s featureless (in a good way), there are two lanes, straight as an arrow, flat as a tac, with a line of nothing-trees as far away from the road as I can chuck a shotput. They artfully obscure any view that might have been there.
It’s the blandest road I’ve been on. *Ever.* Nullarbor-esque. Just absolutely nothing. Nothing to engage the brain. Not a single distraction.
A very, very lonely road.
Hardly any villages to speak of, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.
There’s no traffic, except for the very occasional road train, going at a terrifying clip of 120, that’s if they’re sticking to the limit, and I bet they’re not... They pass me like I’m standing still. Blink and you’ll miss it.
The only thing of note is that donkeys are back; I haven’t seen one of those on this side of the Sahara desert. A surprisingly noble creature, the donkey; nothing ever fazes them and they just get the job done. Their return is a sign that we’re leaving the tropics behind.
---
Four hours of nothing and barely anything to report later and I make the conscious, smart and mature decision to break early and get some lunch.
Very out of character.
I manage to find a place with a big plate of rice and mystery meats, most of which isn’t even close to chewable, so it gets the seagull treatment again.
I’m proud of myself for having the discipline, for a change, to take a break and take care of myself instead of blindly racing on to nowhere.
Shooing the kids away from the bike and we’re off again.
---
The road is, somehow, even blander.
*No* diversions.
It’s just me and the thump of the bike and nothing else.
It’s like a world of sensory deprivation by way of sensory sameness.
I’m glued to the speedo and the mile counter.
Even that’s not changing.
I tell myself I can break in an hour, when I’ve done another eighty clicks.
The speedo ticks over, slower and slower. Grinding out.
A watched kettle never boils.
The break never comes...
And then it does.
*I shake it off.*
That felt like *forever*.
I *really* don’t want to get in the saddle for another eighty.
But I gotta do it.
---
I can feel my head crapping out. Everything’s gone to fog and mush. I can’t think clearly.
I start to sing.
*Les Miserables*, the musical. Of of all things.
From the top. "Look down...! Look down....!"
...
"Now bring me prisoner two four six oh one...! Your time is up and your paroles begun. You know what that means..."
"Yes, it means I’m freeee."
"No!"
Etcetera.
I know it all. Every word. I can hear every note from the orchestra in my head.
I get a little stuck in Valjean's Soliloquy, must be said...
My helmet is the opera. The Shrike’s keeping time.
Out here, there’s no critic other than myself, and I really go for it.
It helps.
The clock starts to tick again.
Finally something to focus on. Something else to think about.
Just between you and me; I reckon I do a better Javert than Russel Crowe ever did...
Not that that’s saying much... In fact, that’s not really saying anything.
I go clean through to ABC Café. That’s a lot of singing. More than an hours worth.
I'm not a big fan of Marius, so I let it drop there.
Back to just The Shrike, this road, and Angola.
I feel the slip again.
Then I feel a tug at the left footpeg. Like the footpeg is the rod and I’ve got a fish giving me some bites. A random sort of feeling, like someone’s giving the underside of the pegs a little tap with a hammer every now and again.
It’s disconcerting.
"What *is* that?"
It’s happened before back in Ghana, it weirded me out then, and then it went away, I guess.
It’s weirding me out again now.
Something in the gearbox? From stomping on the gear before? Oil?
*What is it?*
My head won’t let it go. Like a dog with a bone.
I try to start up Les Miserables from the top again but I can't stay focused. I’m too busy concentrating on the feeling through my foot like a blind man’s fingers on a strip of braille.
My ears pick up a tinging. A *definite* tinging...
*Clanging* now.
*"Fuck."*
---
I’ve been spending half my time looking at the road, the other half looking for the problem.
I’m measuring the clank and tink and tug against every variable that I can imagine. Searching, mentally reaching for the cause. Causes lead to outcomes.
Nothing but nightmares.
I have to break. I can’t handle thinking and feeling and listening for it anymore. My head and senses are in overdrive, going into meltdown.
I pull over to walk it off.
It’s my only weapon for shaking it off. The only handle I have left to pull.
Ondjiva’s still a couple of hundred kilometres away...
I get back on the bike and go. It starts clanking right away.
I feel my throat constrict.
Oh shit.
The pinch at the back of the jaw. Then the tightness in the chest. The rising heat.
I can’t breathe.
I pull over again. Turn off the bike.
I’m dying. I’m dying or breaking or both.
Everything is overwhelmed, like a thick wave has me pinned under. I’ve gone in too deep, I’ve burned through myself, all my energy, all my resources. And now it’s killing me. I’m drowning.
*I can’t fucking breathe.*
Each out breath gets stuck on the uptake, and for a long moment my lungs are wrung empty, and I can't breathe in again. Till my throat clears and I can suck oxygen again.
I feel like I'm breathing through a straw.
I take a walk. A very long walk.
My body slowly backs away from the cliff of tightness.
I can breathe a little.
But I can’t get on that bike again.
I *can't.*
It’s *terrifying* me.
I can't do *that* again.
I don’t know if I can do these miles. I don’t think - even if nothing goes wrong - that I can go that far.
And if something, something catastrophic happens? No.
But I can't stop here.
There are no villages. 
There’s *nothing*; The last three hours have felt like I’ve been on a landscape treadmill. Same same same *nothing*.
Can I wait here and put it on a truck? How would I stop a truck? Convince them to take me and the Shrike? How would I lift the Shrike over my head onto a truck? What if the trucks are full?
There’s nothing for it.
I can’t do this anymore. I can’t take it. It’s too much.
But what’s my other choice?
I wish I had a motorbike. A *big* motorbike. A highway monster where we could smash the rest of this distance in no time. I want a 120km/h hog, but I’m stuck with my 60km/h Shrike. It feels like I'm crawling. I just want it to be over.
If there was any out that I could take, I’d take it. I wouldn’t even think twice; fuck the trip. The candles been burning at both ends and now it’s over.
But there *is* no choice. No other option.
I can still feel the fizz in the head and the shortness of my breath being squeezed out by the tight, balled up chest. But it's not getting any better.
*Get on with it.*
I throw my leg over the bike, and like last night's cold shower I feel like recoiling away out of reflex.
As I ride, it slowly ebbs away. And a softness comes in to replace it. Everything goes soft and mushy. A beautiful feeling of non-terror. The body relaxes like I’ve taken a hit of deadening opiates.
Into oblivion
---
I find my clanging culprit; it’s the chain slapping around on things it shouldn’t be slapping around against.
And that’s not a bad thing; my head had far worse theories bouncing around in there.
That chain was tight as a snare drum only a couple of days ago...
Every time I go over fifty clicks an hour it starts clanging and slapping. So even though all I want to do is go faster and faster I stick to under fifty.
It’s like not moving at all.
And there’s still such a long way to go...
---
It all goes to hell again. I’m dying again.
Mind, body and soul all go haywire. I can’t *control* anything.
I stop quickly, again. And walk it off, again.
The chain is crazy loose.
*Can’t be long now...*
I don’t fix it; that’d take a long time. I go again.
I just want this day to be over.
---
I have to stop again.
---
And again.
---
And again...
Over and over. Every time my head and body lose it, I have to stop.
I lose count of the number of times I have to stop to hold back whatever it is that’s killing me.
I just want to lie down. I want to lie flat. *I can’t ride anymore.*
Each time I stop it gets harder. Each time it’s worse.
It feels like I’m making no progress between stops.
It’s getting more and more desperate.
*I am* more and more desperate.
I can feel the tension ratcheting. I don't know what happens if it snaps...
The clinking and clanking gets worse and worse, and louder and louder. Even at low speed it’s still not happy.
*Something's gotta give.*
---
I crawl into Ondjiva in twilight.
Eight hours.
Three hundred and ninety of the slowest clicks.
And that’s Angola.
*Done.*
With only fifty clicks to go to the border with Namibia, it’s almost in the books.
I’m calling it.
I do a flyby of the village and see nothing.
I pop the question to some locals and they point me in the right direction.
I find a place to stay. It’s outrageously expensive. But the Kwanza has become like monopoly money for me; it’s lost all of its meaning, so I'm making it rain.
Plus, breakfast is included.
The day washes off me in the shower. The tension, the worry, the fear.
I start to feel like myself again.
A little bit.
The last two days of grime and road grit goes with it down the drain.

## Chapter Nine
I adjust the chain tightness.
*Working feels good.*
I re-discover that you can indeed do a chain tighten, as in Cameroon, without having to get the rear brake metal push rod thingy out of the way, which is a fiddly bitch of a thing. The last time I tightened the chain - I'm not sure where - I remember that this baffled me, and I ended up removing the rod completely.
The problem is the exhaust pipe. When it's warped over to the left against the brake lever it cramps you for space, and there’s just no room in there to fit a spanner. But if you kick the shit out of the exhaust pipe to make some space, you can fit the spanner in underneath the nut, and it's a piece of cake from there; loosen that “castle nut” which acts as a locknut, loosen the big nut under that one, which makes the whole lot “slideable”, slide the wheel backwards along the guides till the chain is under tension, and tighten it all back up again.
I notice that the swingarm, which the back wheel is attached to, wiggles ever so slightly from side to side if you give the wheel a push or a pull. It should be rock solid. It's disconcerting. Something to take care of at the next service.
As I work, I think.
It seems that after all of the uncertainties and all of the things that scare me have been swept away, new ones have come in to replace them; The Congo's are over, and I’ve reached a permanent state of good tarmac, and there are no more embassies. *Forever.* So the attention turns to whether the Enfield is going to make it or not.
And I'm not sure about that.
*There's still a very long way to ride...*
---
The “pensao” – the place I’m staying – has a weigh ‘n’ pay smorgasbord dinner. That’ll do me.
I’m serving a big fat plateful of whatever that is in the steaming metal box. I’ve earned it.
My mind turns to tomorrow. It’s a short day with a border crossing, but I don’t know how the visa situation’s going to go; whether or not that “declaracao” is good enough to get me out of the shit, or what Customs are going to think of that Congo passavant that the guy at the other end of the country just wrote over, signed and stamped.
Flaky.
I wonder how easy it’s going to be to get into Namibia without any paperwork or visa; I'm assuming I'll be let in just because I’ve got a British passport.
And then there’s not having a Carnet for the bike... Namibia and then South Africa are, I imagine, much more rigid with the rule book than *Africa* Africa. I don’t know what I’ll do if they just flat-out tell me no...
I'm expecting the most interesting stories to come from Angola Immigration. Second place goes to Namibia Customs.
So many places where it could all go balls up.
Walking to the counter with my dinner tray full of food and I *swoon*. Out of nowhere.
I lose my head off my shoulders. I lose my body. I lose control.
I nearly black out and ditch dinner.
My brain pumps in the fizzing adrenaline to keep me conscious, keep me from swan diving on my face. I feel it drip down my head and spread. It does the job; I keep my feet.
I’m at the end of my tether.
I stumble to the counter to weigh, and pay.
I’ve overdone it at 1,200 kwanza. I can’t do that math, but I know it’s a lot. I don’t care.
I get back to my seat and try to figure it out.
*What’s going on.*
I can’t. It’s all the same questions with the same no-answers.
I’ve eaten well today. Well, maybe not well. But I’ve eaten something. So it's not that...
*What’s happening to me?*
---
Morning.
Border day.
It's freezing, again. Even under the good blanket I've spent the night feeling the chill.
I'm up at dawn, which is becoming something of a habit.
I quaff the free breakfast of an omelette and coffee.
I’m barely a step out of the restaurant door before it all turns south. Puddle in a hurry.
Surprise!
I sprint.
As fast as I dare.
*What was in that omelette??*
Not gonna make it...
I shoulder charge the door into my hotel room, nearly taking it off at the hinges. I make a lunge for the throne in the nick of time.
*A photo finish.*
I’m not entirely sure I got “nothing but net”.
Out it comes like a bat out of hell. *Evil* fucking thing.
All that “sea gulled” mystery meat from yesterday’s lunch, the massive pile of weigh n pay, the omelette, well, that didn’t even touch the sides...
*I wish I chewed more.*
Besides almost making an unholy mess, it’s not a big deal.
---
I dare not move any further than spitting distance from the toilet, but after an hour’s worth of trips to and from the throne, it’s a done thing. *Over with.*
What used to knock my guts out for days and days at a time is now gone in sixty minutes.
This iron gut I’ve cultured, hard earned and hard worn, it’s handling food poisoning like a champ.
I’ve finally got myself - over the course of *months* of dodgy food - to being *street food invincible*. *Nothing* can touch me.
And all for what?
Today’s probably my last day of rough food. I might never see another plate of grisly African mystery meat and dodgy as fuck sauce for the rest of my life.
I'm retiring at the top of my game.
I load up the Shrike.
---
All talk of iron gut aside, this could be a little touch and go...
If I haven’t fully cleared the decks like I’m assuming, well, that could be disgusting.
Apparently I’m not the only one who’s crook today; the Shrike sounds like dog shit. Under brakes she’s backfiring, badly - The exhaust letting off deafening bangs like a gun going off.
Bad bad not good.
---
Where last night forty kilometres felt like an eternity, this morning it feels like a blink. We’ve hardly begun before we’re at the frontier.
It’s all relative, I guess...
The border is *massive.*
There’s a huge building off to the side, like a giant sort of shed. I’ll be buggered if I know what it’s there for. Everything looks tidy and modern, well organised and efficient.
Given the situation, I was hoping for a bit of a shambles that would be easy to slip; organised and efficient might means *thorough*, and thorough means I’m thoroughly in the shit.
*I’m going to get my pants pulled down here.*
Apparently, by the rule book, it’s one hundred and fifty clams a day for any time overstayed on the visa. Clams being dollars, not kwanza...
One hundred and fifty times four days overstayed.
*It’s going to hurt...*
I'm ready to fight the good fight with my “declaracao”.
I’m gee’d up, I’m ready to go to war.
I wind-down The Shrike. All the backfiring ensures we get everyone's attention, and quickly draw a crowd.
I’m beset upon by the normal fixers and money changes and folks selling bananas or whatever.
As I unstraddle the Shrike, the hour of vibration has left me feeling a little, well, *loose*.
I can’t see any obvious toilets anywhere...
I leave the mob to ogle The Shrike and I head over into a small, neat demountable building which is labelled “Imigracao”.
There's one well-dressed uniformed bloke sitting behind a well organised, clean desk.
I introduce myself with a big smile and apologise in Portuguese for my awful Portuguese. He asks me to take a seat.
I sit down and hand him my closed passport; I’ll be fucked if I’m going to hold his hand and show him where to fuck me, if he wants to get me, he’ll have to sleuth it out like Sherlock.
While he’s fingering through my passport I scan over the room. On the desk in front of me, next to the computer (yes! A computer!!) is one of those fancy passport scanners that you see at Immigration in normal airports.
*I’m so fucked.*
Maybe I could distract him by shitting my pants?
I could totally do it. *Right now.*
Spray on demand.
He starts typing into his fancy computer who knows what.
He asks me for my motorbikes rego number.
Not sure how that’s relevant to Immigration, but whatever.
He back and fourths for a bit, then grabs a big fat “chonk-chonk” stamp and smacks it onto one of the passport pages with a beautiful, glorious *thwack!*
Surprise!
Job done.
Not a word said about the visa or the overstay. Never even mentioned it. It’s anyone’s guess whether he noticed it or not...
*Jackpot*.
You fucking beauty.
Back out with the mob again, who are still ga-ga over the Shrike, and I try to follow up one win with another, bargaining hard to get my money changed to Namibian dollars for a decent rate.
Nope. They won’t budge on their exchange rate. Not an inch. And I get reamed on the exchange.
Whatever. I'm happy to have it done, and the fact I’m not nearly a *grand* down the drain already is a massive win. Getting a good exchange would have been gravy.
Onto the bike again. It sounds fucking crook as a dog. It’s a wonder it’s running at all.
Customs are up ahead at an open gate that I can definitely buzz. If I don’t have to explain that dodgy Congo/Angola passavant, the more the good.
The officials don’t seem to be paying attention, so buzz it we shall.
But The Shrike won’t do subtle, backfiring like an old western gunfight, enough to wake the dead, and enough to wake the officials from their stupor.
They come running to stop me.
God *damn* it.
Two blokes who look way too badass to be Customs pull me up. They look more like a SWAT team than boring border officials... Big bastards too.
They ask me for my Carnet. Straight up. *I'm fucked.*
I don’t bother to explain that I don’t, and never have, had one - that can only make things more complicated. Instead I shake hands, apologise in Portuguese for my terrible Portuguese, and cough up the dodgy passavant.
They want to know what I’ve been up to on the bike. More interested than interrogatory... so we chat about that for a while. They hand me back the passavant, tell me to watch out for those thieving bastard Namibians, and, surprise! wish me good luck.
Fuck yeah!
Angola: Done.
Fucking *done*.
Adios, mofos!
I’m going to go buy a lotto ticket. This has been *too* good.
We backfire our way over to the Namibian side of the post.
---
Immigration is a piece of cake: fill out a simple form, get a stamp, no visa, no questions.
And they speak English. *Hallelujah.*
Welcome to Namibia.
I head to Customs - the last piece of the puzzle.
I have to dodge past another group of officials on the way, who look a lot like Customs, but aren’t Customs...
They wanted me to pay a *road tax*, which ain’t gonna happen... I tell them that the lady at Immigration told me that I had to see Customs first and they swallow that.
At the legit Customs there’s no one behind the perspex sheet, so I busy myself with reading the papers tacked onto it while I wait. Knowledge is power.
The first bit of paper says “TIP: Temporary Import Permit”. *I’m in the right place...*
Behind the Perspex it all looks pretty legit. Very formal, very organised. Not looking good for me then.
Once I’ve read all the papers, and run out of patience, I start “hallooooo”-ing through the hole in the bottom of the window.
Finally, someone comes to attend to me, she gives me papers to fill out while she goes and finds the boss.
Papers are pretty straightforward; the usual guff: Name, passport details, addresses...
A man who looks like a businessman shows up and slides the Perspex back a smidge.
“Carnet”
*Fuck.*
I can go sycophantic or assertive...
Assertive.
“I don’t have one” I nearly spit it at him.
“No Carnet?”
“Nope, I don’t need one. Here, look at my passport, I’ve been to all these places with no carnet. Look. See? I don’t need one”
He says he needs to go and speak with his boss.
*It’s gonna go tits up.*
After five he comes back to the window with an older version of himself.
“Where is your carnet??” The boss this time, accusing.
“I don’t have one. I don’t need one.”
“How did you make it to Namibia without a Carnet?”
I sound off on my fingers, “England, Scotland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, The other Congo, Angola, and, voila, Namibia. All without a carnet.”
It’s a hell of a list. All twenty seven of them.
It's overkill, and takes some saying, but it’s evidence enough, and it works a charm.
The boss gives it the nod, they whack a stamp on the papers I’ve just written on, which is a little weird. They tell me that *that’s* my permit, and I can go.
Handshakes all round.
I’m in.
It’s over.
And I didn’t crap my pants. *Not once.*
Welcome to Southern Africa.

## Chapter Ten
KFC.
First thing out of the border post and there’s a dirty great big KFC. Kentucky Fried Fucking Chicken. I’m not sure whether to laugh or to cry.
This isn’t *Africa* Africa anymore, we’re home...
Getting out of the post is busy. It’s a nightmare. The cars and bikes are all over the road and they’re all cutting absolutely *sick* at me. Horns and gesturing and just pure vitriol.
I won’t cop it.
I give as good as I get.
If this is what Namibia is going to be like, well, it’s going to kill me. Everyone’s driving me off the shoulder of the road, squeezing me out.
I’ve been around, I've been places, and I’ve never seen *anything* like this...
Then it cogs: They drive on the left here.
*Dickhead.*
Well, shit, *no one told me*.
No signs at the border or anything.
I'm back on the “right” side of the road and things calm down.
---
Re-wiring the brain is a headfuck in reverse, and even though I’ve spent my entire life on the left side of the road I still nearly get myself wiped out at every "T junction" I come to. I take the wrong line. *Every time.*
Dangermouse.
---
Half hour of bland, long, straight tarmac takes me to a town called *Ondangwa*, and that’ll do me; they’ve got another KFC here.
It’s a weird village. There’s no people. *None.* But along with the KFC, they’ve got a massive and modern supermarket and even a mall. *A mall*.
I find the cheapest accommodation option available and shack up. At 200 Namibian Dollars, it’s pretty good value; big bed, hot shower, TV, AC, clean and tidy. Twenty bucks.
I’m just happy to be done with the bike.
Because I had the trots this morning I didn’t dare take even a sip of water on the ride; that would have been bad news.
I’m as dehydrated as a prune, so I guzzle my body weight in water.
My decision to avoid fluids is *immediately* vindicated.
I should have sat on the toilet before taking a drink; it doesn’t touch the sides, it’s like my internals have just turned into hollow pipework with no bloody valves...
*Awful*.
The last couple of day's I've felt a cold coming on. So I’ve gotta hydrate somehow, but short of an IV drip I don’t know how to do that if everything’s going straight through.
Is that going to change the way I eat?
Shit no.
---
The local supermarket feels like it’s been helidropped straight in from western civilisation. If I squint, I could easily pretend I'm at home.
I buy a half litre of peach yoghurt and three bananas. I scoff that before I’ve even made it out the front doors.
Fuck I’ve missed yoghurt.
Refrigeration. *What luxury.*
On the way home I buy a greasy box of chicken from KFC. Can’t not.
I jog home to atone for my sins.

## Chapter Eleven
I just didn't want to get on the bike today.
*Really* didn't.
Lying in bed with nothing else to do, it hit me like a sense of dread. And so I didn't; I've decided to stay here for the day.
I’m not crapping through a straw anymore, so that’s a plus.
I try my best to kill the day by looking at rectangles, just like I used to.
I head to a nearby fancy hotel and they’re happy for me to hang out and use their internet so long as I buy something from the restaurant.
We’re all slaves to our blood chemistry, and I’m simply a better person after coffee.
Enthusiasm, energy, smiles for everyone, and pleasant conversation seems to flow out of me from almost the moment I’ve put the cup down.
After a few hours of rectangle time – video calling the family, generally loitering around online – I decide I can’t do it anymore. It’s starting to make me feel *greasy*. How I used to do it for eight hours a day, five days a week, two hundred and forty days a year is beyond me. What was normal back then just seems an impossibly long time to me now.
And, while we’re on it, why is it ok to spend 1,920 hours a year, at least, looking at a rectangle when you’re an adult, but when I was a kid (and it’s all I ever wanted to do...) I was told it wasn’t good for you - your eyes will go square - and I'd be forced to play outside.
How come no one ever forced me to play outside once I grew up?
*What’s the difference?*
Why is that not only acceptable for an adult, but *expected*. Normal.
Beats me.
I've had enough of this. I head back to the hotel.
I work on the Shrike. The nuts that clamp the exhaust pipe onto the motor are only finger tight. Not even that, in fact. No wonder it was running like a dog.
I watch soccer, which I don’t even like, from my bed.
Luxury.
Day successfully killed.
---
I don’t want to leave.
It's not really that I don't want to leave, I just don't want to ride.
It’s just a bad feeling.
But I’m in Namibia now - there’s nothing to be worried about. I’m safe. It’s all going to work out.
I don't have a choice. It’s got to be done.
---
I leave Ondangwa early enough to make good time, but late enough that I don’t freeze my arse off (yeah, it’s still bitterly cold in the morning).
Tsumeb, the next potential stop, is two hundred and fifty clicks away. Which isn’t massive, but it’s not short either.
Very quickly it becomes obvious that this is going to be another boring, braindead ride. The roads are straight, there’s fuck all to look at. Just miles and hours of nothing.
Suboptimal. But it could be worse.
Easy miles.
This is what I wanted, right?
---
I’m checking the oil level every now and again. The oil fairies are stealing the oil again. Either that or it’s not going well...
I don’t care anymore.
But, as I draw closer to Tsumeb, I can feel a rising desperation.
I want this ride *done with*. I want the day *over.*
I’m *dying* for it to be over.
I keep going.
I feel my throat seize up like someone’s throttling me. Choking up. I pull over the bike and I’m ready to bawl my eyes out. Like a bitch. For absolutely no reason.
I walk it off.
The air is sharp, biting dry. And although it’s not hot there’s a brutality to the sun bashing down on my helmetless face. It’s less of a feeling of heat and more like being invaded by radiation.
I get back on the bike.
I'm ok...
---
It gets worse and worse.
The length of time I can spend on the bike before having to get off and take a walk gets shorter and shorter, till I can’t even string together thirty kilometres without having to take a break; the closer I get to the goal, the further away it feels. 
This time a year ago I could *run* that far without taking a break. It feels pathetic.
I'm getting woozy and the whole situation is just crap.
All of it is only a problem between my ears, I’m sure of it; the external situation is actually fine. The road is good, the bike is rolling, the weather is fine, the traffic is low, it's all easy miles, and only a short ride; it's *nothing*.
But I'm ready to snap.
It's insane and irrational.
After all of the hardships, after all of the difficult places that I've been to and through, after all the challenges that I've passed, and now I'm on the verge of a breakdown in Namibia.
*Seriously?*
It doesn't make any sense.
I'm trying to rationalise it somehow.
On the road, I try to change my attitude from defeatist over to nihilist.
Nihilism: Life is meaningless.
Stirring quotes on the utter meaninglessness of life in a random universe abound from Marcus Aurelius and Tim Minchin, and I get a *glimpse* of the right attitude; small pockets where all the petty concerns melt away under the blowtorch of nihilism.
But then I sink back into the defeatist and just stay there.
I hate this.
I think it has less to do with the bike (we've been here before...) and more to do with my health.
Which isn't to say fitness, but my *health*.
Somethings wrong. That's clear.
And not being able to put a name on it is what concerns me the most...
I was hoping to hold off on seeing a quack till I got back home. But this country is westernised enough, which should mean that it has western medicine. I don’t think I can hold off any longer, it can't wait till I get home, or break...
Home, like Tsumeb, seems so close, yet impossibly out of reach.
---
Even the slowest train makes it to the station eventually.
I crawl into Tsumeb, feeling fucked up in the head.
There's a mall and a KFC here. Same same.
Surprisingly, my GPS has some options for "lodging" built into the map. Even more surprising; there are a few hostels about and even a “backpackers”.
We're definitely not it Kansas anymore.
After a couple of failed attempts at the hostels I head to the backpackers, which is a little further from the main drag than I'd usually like to stay.
The place, from the outside, looks modern and fantastic, with a nice garden and lots of lawn.
I can't get in through the big locked gate though, and ringing the bell and hollering through the grating is getting me nowhere.
So I sit on the floor and wait for someone to show up.
I inspect the backs of my hands. They're a raging rash. Red and inflamed and itching. I think it's the dryness. 
---
A neighbour shows up. He's white, which still feels weird to me. He offers to call the owners for me.
They show up in a twinkling.
They're white too. White Namibians. It's *weird*.
They’re super friendly, happy to have me, and let me in.
The place is superb.
Absolutely spotless with brilliant facilities like hot showers and very comfortable dorm beds.
I'm the only one here.
*Perfect.* I'll take it.
---
While I’m unloading the Shrike a young British couple rocks up, after them a group of three German lads rock up in a campervan.
So many white people all in the one place.
What are they *doing* here?
It feels so weird to see travellers.
I welcome them like old friends. It’s great to have distracting company, diverting my head space as we have a chat and share war-stories. I’m still finding it hard to focus on conversation; my brain just won’t work like it normally would. It’s all fuzzy and I can’t pay attention for longer than a few minutes without losing the thread. It’s hard work.
---
KFC for dinner.
Horrendous greasy delicious shit.
Something makes a noise over my shoulder as I'm tucking in, and I swivel around to see what it was. Too fast. And I nearly black out and fall to the floor with a lump of chicken in my hand.
I stick the landing. My heart is *racing.*
My brain's a blur, my head boggles on the shoulders.
It all takes a few minutes to feel anything close to normal, like my body and brain are starting to behave again.
This is really getting too much.
Feeling the constant need to stave off a blackout is exhausting and terrifying.
I’m fucking sick of it.
I’m sitting, eating chicken for fucks sake, and with no rhyme or reason something craps out and I nearly pitch onto my fucking face.
What’s going wrong with me? Why is it *worse??*
Something I’ve been thinking about is that it’s some psychosomatic vicious cycle, where I'm stressed so I feel faint which stresses me out and makes me feel fainter etc...
But that doesn't make any *sense*. This is too *real* a reaction for stress; too *physical*.
The other is that it's just simple anaemia; I haven't been eating any foods that are high in iron lately, I think... And the symptoms of being light headed and unfocused seem to match well.
I keep thinking that if I throw lots of different food at it the body will eventually get what it needs and come good, but that hasn't been happening...
---
I head the long scary walk back to the backpackers on egg shells.
I make it back.
One look in the mirror and I look like absolute shit.
I'm terribly pale.
My skin is flaky.
The creases of my nose are all dried up and flaking off.
My lips are chapped and the all skin around them is flaking away as well.
My arms are pale and sickly.
My eyes are tired and hollow.
It's all gone to hell.
The travelling beard, well, that's never looked good, but on the fucked up cake that is my face it’s the cherry on top.
I’ve aged. *Years*. Decades, maybe.
It could be the worst I've looked in my life.
Having my teeth knocked out in Barca is the obvious contender, but back then I just looked like someone who’d been in a bar fight. Now, I look crook.
I can’t look at myself anymore. I’m going to bed.
---
So, I’ve decided to test the anaemia theory.
I’ve bought two steaks and a shitload of spinach. If anything’s gonna help, it’ll be that.
Steak for lunch and steak for dinner.
I *immediately* feel better.
Too fast though. I reckon that’s just a big fat placebo; the body doesn’t make new blood cells *that* quick. I don’t think...
Other than eating steak, I’m bored.
There’s nothing to do, and I don’t want to do anything even if there was something.
I've decided that I'll stay here till I'm back up to feeling good again; It's a nice place, it's affordable at 120 Namibian clams a night (12 bucks), and there's no rush.
Plus, I've been told that this is the worst time of the year to go to Cape Town due to the weather, so why bolt to South Africa only to be drenched? Of course, if I didn't feel like shit I would be tearing to Cape Town as fast as The Shrike could take me.
Health comes first.
---
In the last two days I’ve eaten four steaks.
The only thing it’s changed is my farts. It’s like something *died*... I reckon I could kill a small animal with these farts.
Rotting guts aside, I’m probably alright to move on, keep riding, but I’ve decided to err on the side of caution and stay another day.
The young British couple have come back from an overnight trip at the national park. They’ve drowned their ute in a bog and killed the motor. They've rented new wheels while they wait to see how badly they've fucked their other rental car.
It all sounds very expensive.
They’re pretty gutted about it.
They want to know what I’ve been up to. They’re surprised when I say “nothing”.
I have to explain that I’ve been feeling a little crook lately and that I want to get better before hitting the road. I add in, as a joke, “you’re not doctor’s, are you?”
They are. *Doctors*.
*Both of them.*
I jokingly-but-not-really-jokingly ask them “any chance of a diagnosis? Ha-ha?”
Nothing doing. They’re obviously pretty sick of copping that from everyone they’ve ever known ever. Occupational hazard, I guess...
Fuck ‘em.
I could have really used someone telling me that I’m going to be ok, but I’m feeling better today anyway.
---
The British couple find out that their drowned car is basically fucked: water got in where water ain’t supposed to go. And now they’re in the shit.
Their itinerary demands that they crack on, but I daresay that having to do the rigmarole of sorting out a dead rental car that’s stranded in the middle of bumfuck nowhere is going to be a headache. Their plans are fucked.
I don’t feel that bad for them…
They peel off with their second rental, committed to the itinerary. I'm not sure if that's impressive or stupid.
So it's back to just me, again. Solo.
I head back to the dorms and keep chipping away at War and Peace.
My mind can’t help but drift; this book is too laborious not to.
I’m thinking of Cape Town.
Visualising how far away it is. How many days. How many riding days. How long those riding days are.
I wonder; will I lose my mind before then? Will my head make it in one piece?
I’m perfectly relaxed, lying in bed, but I can feel that drip of dread coming into my head, I feel the fizz, just under my skull.
Bang. Dump. Full blown, blind panic.
This is it. *This is the moment.*
I’m going insane.
I jump out of bed. Terrified, *wild*, but there’s nowhere to run to; there’s nowhere, no *place* I can go to escape, though the need to escape is *thick.* Palpable. Utterly urgent.
It’s all that matters.
I stride out to the lawn.
I can’t run from it, though I’m breathing like I’ve been sprinting.
Ragged.
I’m never going to be the same, never going to be ok, ever again.
I throw my shoes on and start walking.
Jaw, locked. Eyes, wild.
I’m losing it.
I walk in the direction of town. The pendulum swings to feeling fine.
100%.
Normal. ish... It swings all the way back and I *swoon* on the spot. My legs are crushingly tired and weak. I can't lift my arms. I can barely hold myself upright.
Right on the point of a total breakdown.
I can’t resist it anymore. All that’s been going wrong, and now this, and there’s *nothing* I can do.
Home is so far away.
What’s *wrong???* Why am I going insane now? Everything, everything, is *fine!*
It makes no sense.
I always thought I was strong. Mentally strong. That’s how I’ve always thought of myself. But insanity has been right there. All the time.
I never knew how weak I was.
How close it was.
How easy that was.
Isolation. Is not good for me.
I’ve been able to handle it because things have been happening. Real things. Real problems. Keeping busy.
With no problems I’ve taken to inventing them.
For your first challenge: you’re insane now.
Good luck, with that.
The thing, *that blackout thing*, takes the chance to flog me while I’m down: The world spins and goes fuzzy and I nearly crumple...
But not quite.
I stumble into town. I don’t know what to do now that I’m here, so I walk back.
This blackout shit originates between the ears.
It sounds insane that my head is doing this, but I'm more and more convinced of it.
I'm the only one who can get it back under control.
*Me.*
---
About three or maybe four time's today I've felt on the edge of it, just that *feeling* of it, that it's coming, and I’ve had to haul myself back from the brink.
It scares the shit out of me. Every time.
The most bizarre thing is that I'm also a bit curious to see what would happen if I *did* have a mental breakdown.
It's all very Percy Cerutty; He had a nervous breakdown, and though he was told it would kill him he emerged stronger from it, and from middle age turned himself into a great man.
Maybe I could do the same.
I want to get into a car, have someone drive me to the capital, Windhoek, then get on a plane and go home.
After all this distance, and all this time, and all of the challenges, I’m ready to throw it in.
I have to remember that I've felt like this many times before; Lome is the one that springs straight to mind; and Matadi, another.
I made it through that, I'll make it through this.
Where is my nihilistic point of view? Where’s all this “life is meaningless” and all that cal.
It's *easy* to be a nihilist when you’re winning.
It's when the chips are down that you have to earn your philosophy.
I've been disappointed so far with how I've handled it; I'm getting sucked into it, this bodily problem, this problem of the flesh.
I should be holding my mind aloof. What will be will be. Flow with the river. Go with it.
How puny, this human body in all the ocean of space and time. Why do I concern myself so heavily in it?
I feel like shit, and I'm scared, so what??
It's utterly out of keeping with my surroundings. This place is so tranquil and calm. It's the most civilised place that I've been to or stayed in for a long time.
There's no rush to be anywhere. I'm safe here.
Everything will be ok.
---
I’m up. Early.
Shit’s gonna change.
I need to snap myself out of this funk.
I put on my shoes, head out the front gate, and run.
First run since Morocco.
It shows.
I've fallen back all the way to square one. Maybe lower than that.
Running's like a game of snakes and ladders, with no ladders.
I’m going slow. Real slow. And I’m still blowing up.
The slightest of inclines have me burning all over. Everything's screaming louder than it ever has to stop.
It feels good to push through and torture myself in a way that I know and understand.
Fuck me, I'm out of shape.
I can feel my arse jiggling, for fucks sake...
It’s a short jaunt, tiny, but it seems to be the thing I needed.
---
I spend the day reading War and Peace, snoozing, or staring blankly at a wall.
I don’t have any real episodes for the rest of the day. 
Sometime, I feel absolutely, 100% fine, and wonder what all the fuss is about.
It's a short-lived but beautiful window of clarity into how I used to work. Lucid. *There*. 
I soon feel drained and not myself and on the verge of catastrophe again.
---
After a long, empty day, a group of four travellers arrives, plus a British couple. A different one.
They're chatty, and we talk about Namibia and other shit and the conversation just naturally goes.
It's nice.
The husband half of the British couple tells us a story about how he was bitten on the scrotum by a dog in a park and had to go get a rabies shot into his ballsack.
Fuck me. I haven't laughed like that in a *year*.
I give the laughter it's reins, and laugh till I feel like my ribs are going to crack and I'm going to vomit. Then I laugh some more.
It's the first time I've cried on this trip. I needed it.
Then one of the four travellers comes into the kitchen - he's a biologist – and he mentions what rabies does: eats the brain and stuff like that, then he mentions that tapeworm also eats the brain.
It hits a little too close to home...
I commit, right there and then, to go to the doctors tomorrow.
What if something’s actually eating my fucking brain?? Right now...
*Jesus!*

## Chapter Twelve
I wake up late at around 7.
The four travellers have disappeared in the night.
I have to push back a sense of fear and panic and dread about just waking up.
So irrational.
I head on local’s directions to the Tsumeb clinic.
A consult’s gonna cost me $N400, which is 40 bucks.
Fine.
My heart is belting in my chest.
Here we go...
The clinic is pretty shonky, but there’s hints of western medicine about the place; diplomas and charts. Plus, the quack, a heavyset Namibian, is wearing a white lab coat.
*That’ll do.*
I tell him what’s going on. I spill my guts; the nearly blacking out, dizziness, tiredness, all of it. That it’s been happening since all the way back in Nigeria. Maybe earlier...
The quack draws a blank.
*He's got no idea.*
A shame. I was hoping he was going to be like “oh yeah, that’s XYZ’s disease, take this tablet and you’ll feel fine this afternoon”. 
But, alas, no.
The doc takes my blood pressure.
It's 120 “over” 90.
The 120 is fine, apparently.
But the 90, that’s no good.
90 is the high limit where, any higher than that, and you have "hypertension".
And hypertension, apparently, is not good.
He's talking this up in a roundabout way as a cause, which I don't like.
Seems to me he's clutching at straws.
I think the hypertension is more likely a symptom of stress - because I’m seriously crook with something else - and I tell him that.
He agrees that that's a possibility.
He says that he could do some other tests like blood, urine and "stool" tests.
I’m all for it.
Let's run the gamut.
He tells me that, while we wait on results, he can give me medication so that I have a "very, very deep sleep".
I tell him that sleep isn't the problem and that I'm sleeping like a baby.
He starts ticking boxes on a blood test form for each of the tests that he wants to run.
He says that he doesn't want the costs to run up too high.
I tell him that money isn't an issue and to go nuts; give me whatever it is he thinks is necessary. So, he duly goes nuts, ticks everywhere, and I'm happy with it.
We're going the whole nine yards.
Let's get this fucker, one way or the other.
---
The "lab guy" takes my blood in maybe 5 different vials. The vials are slow to fill. The last two don’t fill at all, and only get a little splash of the red stuff.
The “lab guy” is wiggling around the needle under my skin, in and out of my vein, to try and find the sweet spot again.
Again and again and again. Jab, jab, jab…
Fucking... rookie... prick.... *fuck...*
He’s turning the crook of my elbow into minced meat.
I’d rather he cut off the end of my finger and milked it like a cow.
*Fuck’s sake.*
I'm gonna whack him if he doesn't get it soon.
He gives up and says what he's got will be enough...
Nope, fuck that. I don’t care, just make it work!
He refuses. Seems he can’t be bothered.
He gives me a couple of tiny containers. It's time for the skill and agility test; pissing and crapping into jars.
Here we go...
Container number one is a breeze, it's cutting the flow off halfway that’s the problem... But I manage it with panache.
Container number two is not so simple...
It's not like it's easy to just squeeze out a half-nug on command... And then there' the added technicality of some very tricky, very blind, hand-eye coordination, if there even is such a thing...
Working from dead-reckoning - fraught with risk.
Try getting just a smidgen of shit, the smallest of nuggets, into a jar the size of an espresso cup, without turning it into a horrorshow.
Good luck, with that.
Nothing left to do but to do it...
---
I'm proud of the result; only a *tiny* chunk missed the target.
All things considered, pretty damn good.
I hand those lovely gifts - still warm - back to my mate, the lab guy.
You couldn't pay me a billion dollars to work in the medicine industry.
Fuck that.
Anyway, they’ve got to send it all away to a proper lab in a different village, where someone who's probably trained for *years* gets to pull my turd out of a jar, smear it on a slide, and look at it through a microscope. Why do people *want* to do this job? Imagine how close their nose it when they're looking through the microscope. *It's not even their shit!*
Bugger that.
Apparently, they’ll have the results back, via email, tomorrow afternoon.
Namibian efficiency.
Impressive, especially given that tomorrow is a Saturday.
So, my thoughts prior to getting the results back?
I'm expecting it to show up *nothing*.
Maybe not a clean bill of health, given my shocking diet of mostly omelettes through a lot of Africa, plus my lack of exercise. But I don't think it will show up anything that's drastic that could cause me to feel like I do.
Best case scenario is that they *do* show up something that can explain the issues that I'm having, and that it’s treatable. It would be wonderful to tie a bow on this awful feeling and then kick it in the arse and out the door forever.
But I'm not banking on it.
In the case that they come up with nothing, well, that won’t be so bad either. I will at least know that my bodily health is ok and that I'm not at risk of anything awful happening in terms of my bodily health; I won't be dying soon. It will also tell me that the likely cause would be being stressed out. That’d be something I don't want to medicate for; I'll deal with it myself, just like I’ve been doing so far.
If that turns out to be the case, that it’s not body and all mind, well, that’s going to be pretty fucking terrifying, verging on unbelievable; that my body can be so heavily, and tangibly effected by something as abstract as a state of mind.
This is the problem that I'm expecting to be confronted with tomorrow.
I'll deal with whatever comes.
I head home to wait, and kill another day.
---
I feel fucking brilliant.
Things feel clear, I feel *myself*. Everything is *normal*. Wonderfully, magnificently normal. I can think, I can move, just like I used to.
I could fucking tap-dance.
It’s a brief window, and before long I'm back again. Fogged. Scared. Like I can’t breathe properly.
The four come back to the hostel after their day trip to the national park.
Again, it's another glowing review.
*Tonnes* of animals. Not the usual, boring suspects either. Not just herbivores. Cheetahs and lions and elephants. Crazy shit.
It sounds amazing.
It’s right there, a stone’s throw away, and I can’t do it.
Such a missed chance.
---
I’m half in and half out of sleep, dozing off.
I roll over and a throb of deep of pain comes from the back of my jaw. Right side.
One of my bottom wisdom teeth...
A *lot* of pain...
*Fuck.*
What now??
It’s always been a bit on the piss, that tooth, coming out on a bad angle.
My tongue starts the inspection. It’s like I’ve got a big marble glued next to my tooth. Badly swollen. Raging.
Hurts like hell anytime my tongue goes near it.
What the actual fuck happened??
I panic.
Getting a wisdom tooth extracted in a Namibian village isn't going to be fun...
I can think of nothing that would cause it...
Do I floss it? Brush it? A little bit? Or go hard? Or do nothing?
*Shit.*
What do I do?
Maybe it's from some overzealous flossing?
An injury that’ll heal itself...? I go back to sleep.
---
I can't.
I get up, while everyone's asleep, and re-floss and re-brush my teeth, brushing that wisdom tooth furiously hard.
It *kills*. But as I go at it more and more it seems to reach a threshold of pain and gives up.
I head back to bed and pray.
*This is the last thing that I need...*
---
I wake up to a tender tooth. Still hurts but not so bad that it’s time to get the vodka and pliers out.
Hard to say whether I saved myself with the midnight floss and brush. Who knows.
I go and buy new running socks. I've only got one pair left after the other went missing.
My shoes are starting to stink.
I head to the doctor’s.
They’ve got nothing yet.
I wait.
---
I wait. For the whole day...
Simmering in fucking nerve juice.
Africa’s made me a pro at staring at walls, I can do it for hours, days, even - I’m the best person I know at staring at ceilings and other inanimate objects. But this wait is grinding me out pretty bad.
I inspect the backs of my hands. The rash has turned into a million tiny scabs that cover the backs of my hands. They're itchy and flaky and starting to come off to leave behind pink skin.
I reckon they’re going to make me wait till Monday...
---
*A clean bill of health.*
Red blood cell count, haemoglobin count, white cell count, sugar count, kidney function: all in the normal range.
Theories: debunked.
Anaemia, diabetes, busted kidneys, cancer, HIV, AIDS - the whole shooting match - disproved.
*Shit.*
The only bad note on the report card is my liver.
There are some high and low “flags” in the report with some of the "protein counts".
What about that??
It's not “good”, but according to the doctor it's not causing what ails me - it's nothing to be worried about.
I’m fine...
The Doc reckons that if the other liver metrics were off and not the ones I was having a problem with *then* he would be concerned.
In other words, the liver is ok for the important stuff and letting down the team on the lesser things.
I tell him that I’ve eaten four big steaks in the last two days. I ask if he reckons that might have changed things and that my red blood cell count might have been no good before that?
He gives me a weird look.
This guy’s got no idea what I’ve been going through...
Apparently, red blood cell metrics take *months* to move by a single point, and I’m a long way in the clear.
*I don't have anaemia.*
He’s insisting that I’m healthy.
"No problem. You are healthy."
*Fuck.*
I think...
I know I’m being irrational to wish that I was sick. I know that’s crazy, but I just don’t want to deal with what being healthy means.
I’m not dying; So I’m going insane.
Wait. Not so fast.
Stool!
*Where are those results?*
Apparently, the turds take time to “culture”. Which, other than sounding just delightful, could, *might*, reveal something.
It’s not over yet...
The doc will send me an email letting me know if I’ve got parasites in my colon.
*Thanks.*
I go home to stew.
As I stare at the ceiling it’s all boiling around in my head.
So, the problem becomes more complex. More complicated.
The signs are pointing more and more to the stress and anxiety of the trip having an adverse impact on the body.
That’s a much more tricky customer to pin down.
I still can’t *believe* that.
How tangible and real these impacts are; they feel as physically real as if someone whacked me in the nuts with the flat back of a shovel.
I’m *not* imagining this.
I’m certain of that.
If “the mind” is creating this, all these physical responses, in so debilitating a fashion, completely out of my control, well, that would be as incredible as it is frightening.
A new backpacker comes in and interrupts my train of thought.
His name’s Chris. He’s from England. That’s enough common ground to get to talking.
Chris is dressed in Khaki’s that have gone to tattered, ripped rags – obviously hard earned, and he’s obviously proud to be sporting them as the wearable passport of a windswept and interesting traveller.
He left England almost at exactly the same time I did.
Uncannily close departure dates.
At the crossroads of Africa he went east coast, I went west coast, only to meet up again in the South.
We share war-stories and I forget about my problems for a while. I love interesting characters like this who are good for a chat.
---
I wake up into consciousness and I don’t have to check my pulse, there's no need, my heart is *smashing* away so heavy and fast in my chest, it's so violent that it's enough to wobble my whole body to its rhythm under the force.
I haven’t even moved a muscle. I’m supposed to be “at rest”.
This is my resting heart rate.
*What the fuck is going on??*
I don’t know what to do. I try to breathe calmly, which dampens things off, a bit, but it’s still hitting hard enough that I can count the beats.
I get up, throw my shoes on and head out for a run.
Again, it's pathetic.
A few kilometres at most.
I’m puffing and panting
Stitching up.
My arse is still jiggling.
My calves are tight as a tiger already; they're not strong enough to support the body, even at this shuffling pace, and they're complaining. Loudly.
I know that this is bad for my running. I’m putting the running "cart" before the strength "horse". I’m going to pull up sore. I’m going to break something.
But my mind needs this.
So I run.
I know that what I need right now, for my mind, is to completely exhaust myself physically; I know that it's those type of gut-busting, all out runs that leave me in a headspace that nothing really matters.
But, in my current state, going for a thirty click tear isn't going to happen. I just hope this is going to be enough.

## Chapter Thirteen
It’s time to leave.
I saddle up the Shrike.
Tearing myself away from this safe place, it's as hard as it's ever been. But there's no choice; no reason to stay.
I fire up and roll out.
Onto the main drag of Tsumeb and I can already feel that my sense of balance is off. I have to make constant, un-natural, machine like inputs of thinking and movement to keep the bike in a straight line.
I don’t think I’m going to make it to the next village... Not like this...
No turning back now. Just fucking do it.
---
There’s fuck all to see.
Just like always. 
I'm trying to stay on top of my breathing and trying to keep my mind positive. It’s a constant effort.
The next village, *Otjiwarongo*, isn’t far. A touch under two hundred clicks. About three hours in the saddle.
I'm counting every minute, ticking every kilometre.
I continually calculate the ETA; the estimated time of arrival. Constantly dividing distance remaining by current speed.
It’s exhausting.
---
I ride into town, still ok, just before midday.
I stop to see if my GPS has accommodation options on it, like in Tsumeb. After looking for a few minutes, focused on the little GPS screen, I swoon. *Hard*. I nearly drop The Shrike.
*Fizzzzzzz...*
I was holding my breath. I'm not sure for how long. But enough to nearly black out.
I’m ok.
The moment I stop thinking about it I just stop breathing.
It’s fucking exhausting me, thinking about it every second of the day. It’s just not natural.
---
I get accommodation at the local church, in with the nuns. 
$N180 a night.
18 bucks.
It’s ok.
No, actually, for that price, for a church, it’s pretty shit.
There are two beds - which is no good to me. I’m essentially paying double.
I’m all settled in and it’s just past midday, or something like that.
Now what..?
Otjiwarongo is hardly inspiring...
There’s nothing to do. It's a dead, halfway town.
I need distractions but this place is like being stuck in a sensory deprivation chamber.
Nothing to do but fill a lot of hours between lunch and dinner and bedtime.
I’m not *busy* enough.
That could be part of what’s eating me.
A rectangle would be ideal right now. Any form of escapism.
Give me a fucking Idiot Box.
As it is, all I’ve got is a crappy, easy-reading novel.
Over the hours I read about half of it, then go for dinner.
---
I walk the dark village for an hour.
Nothing doing.
But that’s fine, because the town has a “Wimpies”, a shitty looking fast food joint.
I miss my street food...
I head to Wimpies and they’re fucking shut.
*Shut!?*
Bastards.
It’s only 7pm. What the fuck is going on??
Fucking *shithouse.*
There’s no kitchen at the church so I can’t cook myself something.
I head to the local supermarket and buy a fucking awful looking, plastic wrapped, deep fried chicken, paired with an extremely questionable, cold frankfurt sausage and a buttered bread roll. Coming included with the meal is a tin of soft drink.
Not long ago an egg sandwich would have been a perfectly acceptable dinner. And now this seems super-duper suspect. Funny how quickly standards can change...
I eat the cold chook, pass on the sausage.
I need a shower.
Of course, it’s fucking cold.
Of-fucking-course.
I fucking hate this.
It must be near freezing outside. Literally. It’s fucking freezing and there’s no fucking hot water.
Fuck this.
I come out of the half-minute shower with pink skin. Shivering with violence. Swearing. Colourfully. In a church.
I’m going to hell...
---
I wake up on my back staring at the ceiling. Eyes wide.
Heart smashing in my chest. Like a hammer.
It feels like my heart’s going to *break*.
I hate this.
I hate this so much.
I have to cram down my rising panic that’s already out of control.
It’s light.
Another day.
It’s very early. I put on my shoes and go running.
It's outrageously cold. Seriously, *bitterly* cold. Beyond cold. The sun is a blinding bright pin-prick in the late dawn of a cloudless blue sky, giving no warmth whatsoever. The whole world feels brittle and dry. Snap frozen.
I'm in a pair of shorts and a “breathable” singlet...
I cut the run very, very short; my nipples are threatening to make a break for it.
I take another shower of frozen-over hell and go through the motions, loading The Shrike like a robot.
I can’t control my heart. It won’t listen to me. It’s its own master.
Well, I’m leaving anyway.
I can’t stay here another day.
What would I do?
I fire up the bike. Bless it. It's never given me trouble despite the freezing temperatures and it's hard, short life.
I whack a dirty big strip of gaffa tape over my speedometer. Fuck you, ETA’s. I don’t wanna hear about it anymore.
I bid the nuns farewell, they don’t seem to like me much.
We peel off into the still freezing, crisp air.

## Chapter Fourteen
Out of the village and up to top gear cruising, village disappearing in the mirrors on another lonely, soulless road.
*CLUNK!!*
A single thump right through my foot pegs and up though my whole body.
A complete loss of power.
Nothing.
Nothing but the rev of the engine as it gently coasts.
We're rolling at cruising speed, but I've rolled off the throttle completely and there's no deceleration. No engine braking. The motor is just idling as we keep flying down the road...
Am I in neutral? False neutral?
I change up a gear and drop the clutch.
Nope.
Nothing. No power. Just revs.
I look down between my legs.
The chain is on an angle it shouldn’t be. Not moving. Still.
The chain’s finally given up.
Thank god.
*I’m not even mad;* I can’t believe it’s made it this far.
Plus, it's decided to snap in just about as good a place as possible - within spitting distance of a village.
Even if I can’t fix it here on the roadside I can walk back to the village; I'm not stranded.
Really, for snapping a chain on what was going to be a four to five hour ride of nothingness, you can’t do much better than a few minutes in.
I surprise myself that I’m actually ok with this.
I'm even bordering on pleased; It's like the ratcheted tension has been snapped with the chain, and now I’ve got an interesting activity that I can sink my teeth into.
I kill the engine, and we coast to a stop under gentle braking.
I hop off, take a knee and hunch over, twisting my neck to get a look in there.
The incumbent chain has been jammed in by the front sprocket (the cog with teeth) at a really awkward angle. Doesn’t look good...
The chain must’ve snapped, but the engine and gears haven’t stopped spinning with all their power, till the chain got jammed...
Chances are good to likely that A) the chain won’t come out and/or B) it has gotten jammed against something (the THUNK!), can’t move, and then shredded the still spinning sprocket to hell.
Both of them are probably equally bad outcomes; to fix either of them I'll have to completely remove the engine cover, which I can't do out here because on the other side of the engine cover is the engine; swimming with oil.
Popping that thing off would be like opening the door of a front loader washing machine while it’s got a full load on.
Messy…
It’s a big job; I can't just do that on the roadside here, both because I wouldn't want to – it’d suck – and because I don't have the tools for it anyway.
I can only pray that I get that chain out, and it hasn’t fucked the sprocket teeth.
Only one way to find out...
The bags come off, the tools come out, time to get to work.
It’s messy in there anyway. *Really* messy. Black oil everywhere that’s congealed with road trash to make a pasty black grease.
The jammed chain’s fiddly as hell and stuck hard. Greasy and slick. I can’t get any grip on it for force on it because the aforementioned fucking cover is in the road. I feel like I’m trying to do a wisdom tooth extraction with greased up chopsticks.
It’s jammed in good.
A thousand attempts of trying to get the pliers onto a chain link and slipping off, I finally get some purchase and squeeze like hell. Give it a little tug. It moves a little. Just enough to get a new purchase. I’m screwing my face up, for all that helps.
Link by link the snapped chain flops out.
I spin the sprocket, it has all of its teeth.
*Very* happy with that.
Interestingly, the teeth of the sprocket aren’t “sharp”. Sprocket teeth go sharp and pointy when they're buggered - so I've been told - but these teeth have been worn down to a really shallow level.
I expected them to look like a peaking wave, rather than this rolling swell.
I don’t know where I've picked up the idea that when I change the chain I’m supposed to change the sprocket as well... But the idea’s bedded in there somewhere...
I’ll have to change the sprocket over in Windhoek, I reckon. Definitely can’t do it here; same engine cover problem...
Moving on.
To put the new chain on I've got to slide the whole rear wheel and axle forward towards the motor so that the two sprockets are close enough to fit the new, shorter chain. It works the same way that I tightened the chain up back in Angola, but instead I just slide the whole lot closer to the motor.
The crown nut loosens up nicely. Then the locking nut. No worries.
The big nut’s a tricky fucker.
The little metal rod that connects the brake pedal to the rear brake is in the road. And I can’t get my spanner onto the big nut from the underside, and there’s a bunch of things stopping me from getting at it properly from the top.
I *can* get the spanner on it from the bottom, but I can’t turn the nut far enough around to get another bite of the cherry; the nut is all pointy bits from the viewpoint of the spanner; nothing flat.
It’s giving me the shits.
I try different angles, trying everything out.
I accidentally rest the back of my hand on the exhaust pipe, which is white-hot and melts my skin. Fucking *bastard*.
The backs of my hands were already a mess with those million, tiny, flaky scabs.
And now a big fuck-off burn.
Beautiful. *Delightful*.
I can't be fucked taking the rear brake off. It’s a fiddly fuckhead. I hate it, and I know that I'll burn myself on the exhaust again if I try.
I attack “the big nut” from the top, with the spanner not perfectly vertical because everything’s in the way. I know it’s a bad idea, I know it’s totally the wrong thing to do, I know it’s lazy, I know I should take my time and spend fifteen minutes taking the brake off instead of risking shredding the nut.
Nope.
I put the spanner on the nut as best I can and pull like hell.
If I shred it the nut might as well be welded on...
It shreds...
And in the same moment it let's go of the bolt.
Yes! Right! Done!
It all slides forward.
Spare chain time.
It's already lubed up coming out of the packet, like a big long metal snake.
I reckon I can get it onto the top of the sprocket ok, but if it doesn’t stick to the sprocket enough to loop back around out the bottom then I’m stuffed; my fingers aren’t long enough to reach it that far under the engine case.
I’ll have to engineer some sort of fishing tool to hook it with.
That’s a problem for later though, right now I can’t even get the links onto the top of the sprocket. It’s so *fiddly*. And there’s so much chassis and frame in the way.
With more arse than class, I get it onto the top link. I don’t really know how I managed that...
I turn the sprocket slowly, link by link going on the teeth, and the links stick to the teeth just enough to get to my fingers reaching for them as they come back out the bottom.
*Easy*.
Thank god.
I’m filthy greasy; I can’t even see the burn anymore. My hands are just black and shiny.
Getting the chain onto the back sprocket’s a piece of cake, there's nothing in the way, no fiddling, just straight on.
Now to connect both ends together to make a loop.
There’s a special "split link" for that. It's basically a full link that comes in pieces, so that you can link up the chain with it.
Surprisingly simple (and weak looking) for something that puts up with so much constant pressure.
I’m comparing it with my other, dead chain. It doesn’t look right...
I’m missing two “O” rings; little rubber rings that go onto the two rods on the split pin. They're there to stop metal from contacting metal - which isn’t good for something that moves...
Where *are* they??
I look all through the packet and all around on the floor. Nothing.
*Shit*.
Can I use the old ones? They don't look like they match the new chain...
I need an answer on this...
Is it a different kind of chain? Maybe?
The old, dead chain has “O” rings between all of the links. Every single one of them. Fresh chain has none.
So I’m OK...?
Maybe I ordered the wrong kind of chain?
Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve fucked up an order for parts…
Fuck it.
What else can I do?
If this is the wrong kind of chain and I destroy it I’m no worse than right now.
If the shit hits the fan again I can always hitchhike.
On goes the ringless split link and the holding clip snaps into place with squeeze from the pliers.
*Done*.
I slide the whole rear axle and all that’s connected to it back into place to pull the chain tight.
Gotta lock that into place.
I can’t tighten up that “big nut” as much as I would like for the same reasons that I couldn't loosen it.
I still can't be fucked loosening the rear brake to do a proper job... It's probably super-dooper unsafe - if that rear axle becomes unhinged... Well...
But, by my wet finger in the air, I reckon it’s tight enough to make it to Windhoek, where I’m going to have to take the whole thing apart anyway to change that sprocket.
I give back wheel a spin to test the handiwork.
Something weird's going on...
Despite the chain being good and tight, the links when they come in contact with the front sprocket sit up on the teeth and then pop down into place, hard.
Maybe it’s because I’m spinning from the wheel, and not the sprocket itself?
I turn the motor on, drop it in first and slowly let the clutch out while it's still on its stand. Everything’s spinning around and around and the links are still snapping in between the teeth.
Sounds bad. Looks bad.
I'll be fucked if I know why it's doing this; it doesn't make sense to me that it would be the worn down teeth on the old sprocket, if anything, worn down teeth would have the *opposite* effect... Maybe the chain is slightly off spec? And what good is that to me? I can’t do jack about that.
Nup. I’m coming up with doughnuts.
The smart thing would be to ride back to the village and figure it out.
"*Fuck it.*"
Everything goes back in the bags, covered in fucking grease. I toss the saddle bags back on The Shrike. Strap down the spare tyre on top of them, and then strap the tent on top of that.
*Keys*...
Where are my keys?
I had ‘em a second ago; I used them to lock up The Shrike’s toolbox.
Pat-down. Nope.
Saddlebag’s pockets. Nope.
Ground? Nope. I think...
*You mindless fucking idiot.* Where have you put them?
Off comes everything, tossed back onto the roadside.
Mug.
Out come’s everything from the bags.
All my stuff, all of my clothes, out onto the road.
I've got too much stuff...
The keys are right at the bottom.
What was I *thinking*??
Pain in the fucking arse.
I load up. For the third time this morning.
Fire up.
Windhoek. The capital. Let’s go.
I sit on the fully loaded Shrike and hump it off the centre stand.
Under full load I check the chain tension.
It’s tight.
Way, *way* too tight. There’s supposed to be a bit of slack - I should be able to lift the chain a smidgen with my fingers.
This thing’s ratcheted tighter than a banjo string.
I’ve cocked up my guess at the right setting for the rear axle, bigtime.
The pressure on the chain and sprockets, even just sitting here, must be enormous. It’s tight enough to be a tuning fork if I give it a flick.
I have to fix it.
It’s important.
I’ll have to take all the gear off and do 90% of what I just did, *again*.
I stomp into first and drop the clutch.
“*Fuck it! Just, fuck it!!*”
I'm out of here.
---
The new chain and the old sprocket, under the hypertension, and with that weird popping chain on the teeth thingo, should have torn the whole assembly apart. Worse than that, it could have easily fucked something important...
But it didn’t.
What did change is that the oil leak I’ve had since France went from being manageable to absolutely hosing out.
*Pissing* out.
I saw some poor bastard driving too close behind me whack his windscreen wipers on.
*That* bad.
Can’t imagine he was thrilled to find out that it wasn’t water being thinly sprayed in a mist over his entire vehicle...
In any case, we've made it.
I front up at a backpackers in Windhoek.
The Shrike still rolls, but it’s skunked half of its oil sump out its arse over the last four hours.
The saddlebags are a tar pit.
If that’s not enough of a problem, it’s started to weep oil out of one of the gaskets on the actual engine cylinder head.
Unrelated, but suboptimal nonetheless.
Truly, if any of these things turns into a serious problem I have no qualms about putting this bike on a truck.
No fucking qualms.
I’m done here.
Anyway. The ride to Windhoek wasn’t too bad. It's ok actually. It's got to be the first ride in a very long time that has felt like the time has gone by without me being conscious of it every single second.
It was a welcome relief.
That duct tape over the speedo was a deadset masterstroke, I reckon.
I must’ve looked down, only to see a strip of duct tape, a thousand times in the space of half a day. It's incredible how often I unconsciously glance down at that speedo like some OCD tick.
I still had to keep on top of my breathing every now and again. But I think I've got the hang of it; when I realise that I'm not quite right I take big long slow breaths - like a freediving breathing technique - holding my breath at the top of a lungful for a half second, just like I would do in the water, and then letting it all out in a way that makes the muscles melt. It has the double effect of getting the oxygen in if I have been holding my breath, and just calming me down if I haven't been.
Anyway. We’re here now.
Post-Shrike-inspection I head to the front desk.
Fully booked tonight.
Bummer.
There's a guy running around trying to find his camera so he can take a photo of The Shrike.
He's wetting himself with excitement.
We get to talking and, apparently, he’s a bit of a Royal Enfield enthusiast. A rare breed in these parts...
He’s taking shots of the Shrike, and he’s asking me how long I’m staying.
I say none, they’re fully booked tonight.
He’s the owner.
Suddenly, there's tonnes of beds available in the hostel. *Take your pick.*
I book in for a week and at 120 Namibian dollars a night - twelve bucks - with the 7th night free, that's good value.
The bed is clean, there are lockers, and the room has its own bathroom. The bathroom's clean.
There's free interwebs and there's a big screen that’s playing sport. The cricket’s on.
I'm happy with it.
Good place to shack up for a week and get spares shipped in. A good place for a pit stop.
---
Time. To. Wander.
Windhoek is a nice place. I like it.
It's a short walk from the backpackers to town, and the town wouldn't be out of place in Australia; baby skyscrapers and shopping malls and that sort of thing. 
Very western; it all feels familiar.
---
Back to the hostel after dinner and I'm winding down.
On a *couch*.
No Shrike.
For a whole *week*.
Just like in Tsumeb, I need this break. Even though it's only been two days of riding since then, I still need it.
More the point, I need to be *occupied*. Busy. Hopefully Windhoek will have that for me.
Even if that’s just conversation, in English, with travellers.
Most of the occupants here are teenagers on school trips from the First World.
Too much of that.
They’re all drop-in’s. They've *flown* here.
I've only met one other tourist my age, and there are no “overlanders” - yet.
But the good thing is that there always seems to be someone around.
I don't feel so alone anymore.
It's such a novel thing to be talking with people about anything other than just small talk. Such a simple thing, but it feels amazing. I feel *me*. I can talk about *anything* and be understood.
One of the kids asks what I’m doing here and I told him I rode a motorbike here.
From there the conversation goes as standard, but the disbelief of these kids is a whole other order of magnitude beyond that of any African I’ve talked to on the journey.
They literally can’t believe it. Won't believe it.
They think I'm full of shit.
Before long the group of three has turned into a group of fifteen, and I’m leading the boisterous mob out into the courtyard like the Pied Piper.
I whip off the cat-piss-stained bike cover with a flourish.
Now they *really* can’t believe it.
But there it is, written all over the filthy, battered Shrike - even down to the black puddle on the floor, like a puppy that’s wet itself.
Absolutely clapped out.
I don’t think it’s ever looked better. Not in my eyes.
Through the eyes of the kids I see again the whole trip as I used to see it, before it became mundane: The biggest adventure that’s possible on this side of the stars.
---
Everyone here is speaking in clickedy-clacks.
It's the time in Africa I’ve heard one of these iconic tongue clickey languages.
It’s kind of awesome.
It’s about all that I can say that’s positive right now.
I can’t write.
Can’t write anything.
Every time I try I feel like I’m probing something dangerous.
Poking where I shouldn't.
It feels like I’m on the cusp of something.
On the edge of a bad discovery.
About to awaken something that I’d rather leave where it is.
Or ignore it altogether and hope it goes away.
I needs therapy...
---
I can feel it.
I feel mentally vulnerable.
It’s been *two* weeks here in Windhoek.
For the whole two weeks all I’ve wanted to do was load the bike up on the back of a truck to South Africa, and just have it be done with. If someone had of showed up at the backpackers in a ute who was going to Cape Town I would have been all over it like a rash.
I’m ready to quit.
So close to the finish line and I’d throw in the towel with nothing short of relish.
I’ve been waiting on spares to arrive for the last two weeks from South Africa so I can give the Shrike a service.
I can’t move in the meantime.
Stuck.
Essentially I’ve been doing anything braindead to kill time.
Sleep is good. I sleep a lot, and easily.
Watching sport is good too.
Anything that doesn’t engage the brain is fine.
It’s why I can’t write right now without... Fuck. Without feeling fucking *awful*.
Truly fucking awful.
Like I’m very, very suddenly, very, very sick. 
I feel like there’s an insanity right there. It’s right *there*.
In me.
*Way* too close for comfort. I don’t want to do anything to rock the boat.
I’ve stopped writing home. I’ve gone out of contact with everyone except those who I have to let know that I'm still alive.
A few days ago here at the hostel I was talking to a traveller about my metaphysics of basically nihilism and I nearly bawled my eyes out. The idea that I'm alone in this universe and that nothing really matters has gone from empowering to terrifying.
I got a message today from a guy who's helping me ship the parts from South Africa, another Enfield enthusiast, who forwarded me this message from the man who owns the dealership in Cape town:
“I am trying to organise with my friends in tourism to get him some sponsored activities and accommodation on the way down as well (obviously he will get a special bike service once he gets down to Cape Town as well). Will you let him know that we can do loads of nice things for him to make his last few weeks an absolute dream holiday."
Unbelievable.
I was thrilled.
Touched.
I can’t believe that they think that I’m worth the fuss.
It’s had the immediate impact of lifting my spirits and turning what's left of the journey from a scary slog over to feeling like I can do it.
I *can* do it.
I'm not alone anymore.
I can get this done.
---
There’s a girl at the hostel.
She’s from Finland.
And she’s giving me the “glad eye”. Bigtime. ("glad eye" is not my term, I didn't coin it, but it’s the only way I can describe it).
This is *diabolical*.
So much so that I get the feeling that someone’s playing a joke on me.
It’s a prank. *Gotta be*.
I’m not looking much better than I was last week in Tsumeb.
I’m still a mess.
Pale and pasty and tired looking and *old* and flaky.
The sideburn sections of my travelling “beard” - just those alone - should be enough to send any member of the fairer sex bolting in the opposite direction.
Filth. Rank.
Even *I* feel repulsed by them.
Add to that that the need a haircut to get rid of the unsightly back of the neck hair...
My flaky and chapped to hell lips are on the verge of just giving up and splitting down the middle; I could go on...
But when she asks “what are you doing today” and I say “Oh, just heading into town to buy a few things, y'know, look around.” she says “ Great! I’ll come with you!”.
“Uh... ok...”
*Baffling.*
And she say's all that with *the glad eye.*
And what eyes... Like nothing else. They’re *stunning*. And unblinking. She literally doesn't blink. It's unnerving. She’s not looking at me, it’s like she’s looking deeper than that.
I find it hard to hold eye contact. It’s too intense.
We hit the town.
---
She’s beautiful, smart, sharp, well-travelled. Adventurous.
As we walk through Windhoek, my palms are sweating. I keep holding my breath. I feel faint and dizzy.
Exactly how I feel when I feel “sick”.
It is between the ears. It is. It’s in my head.
I *know* it now.
---
We've cooked up some steaks together.
She's tailed me the whole day.
So. We’ve got glad eye from a girl of this sort of calibre, and what do I do?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
And I don’t even care. Why should I? A notch on the belt? What's that to me?
I’ve always found that an odd thing to pursue: a fling.
One night stand.
Sex.
And yet, to hear blokes talk about it, that’s as good as life gets.
It’s empty and futureless. Joyless.
Without commitment there can be no deep feeling.
No intimacy. A shell of what it should be.
“A rubbing of the members, followed by an ejaculation.” as old mate Marcus Aurelius blandly puts it.
I reckon that blokes talk it up because other blokes talk it up; I know that I do.
I don’t reckon that any man, deep down, feels any joy or contentment in a fling.
The opposite, if anything.
It’s bankrupt.
But they’ll all talk it up.
I don’t feel like I’m missing anything.
But that’s not the reason that I'm not pursuing Miss Finland. I’m not reciprocating in kind because I’m a pansy. Gutless.
A coward.
The poor girl’s putting in all the legwork and I’m giving her doughnuts.
When I'm sober, it’s basically gotta be “statutory” before you’ll see a return serve from me.
Get me drunk and it would happen in a twinkling... It would be *all* the moves.
I need therapy.

## Chapter Fifteen
We have parts!
We are go!
I head into town and spend a few hours looking for a place to work.
I find a very white, very clean car dealership that does servicing. They’ve got a small motorbike arm attached to it.
*Perfect.*
I go in and smooth talk my way up to the boss. I fill him in on the story so far, and ask if I can use one of their hydraulic lifts tomorrow - for the day - borrow the workshop tools to work on the bike.
He comes back with the usual reply that they’ll do the service themselves.
I don’t want anyone else touching the bike. Not even here.
I say that I’d rather do it. He shrugs his shoulders.
Done.
For free.
Beautiful.
A full day to have a crack at it.
---
Up early.
Off to the servo to give the Shrike its first non-river-water clean in a long time. Only out of necessity; I prefer the “I’ve been places, hard places” look. Covered in shit is when the Shrike looks its best, it’s gnarliest. But working on a filthy bike is suboptimal.
So it gets a good pressure hosing.
A *serious* pressure hosing.
But it’s not enough. The mud and dust is just *everywhere*. Completely ingrained, like it's etched into the paint and metal and rubber and leather.
The sprocket is still absolutely covered in shit.
Won’t be moved. Pressure hose or not.
Whatever. It’ll have to do.
I go buy a spray can of “carb-clean”. This stuff isn't one of God's chemicals. It'd melt the paint off walls...
It'd dissolve anything.
I've seen it go through thick grease like a hot knife through butter.
Into the workshop and onto the lift. I give it to the lump of grimy oil, and it's exactly like I hoped it would be. After emptying the can and feeling light headed from the fumes it's clean as a whistle in there.
All the tools I need are here, but they’re sprawled out all over the workshop. But I'm taking it as a win, as there's nothing worse than a nit-picky, clean-as-a-surgeon mechanic.
I'm sharing the workshop with a chubby, young mechanic who’s keen to get involved in fixing up the Shrike. I tell him I’ll yell if I need a hand; I don’t want anyone else's hands on it.
*Right.*
"Scalpel..."
I drain the sump while the oil is still hot and will flow easily.
First things first: all the usual servicing stuff.
Consult the manual.
I clean the little magnetic collector in the sump screw. It’s always covered in little shards of shaved off metal. Always mildly disturbing.
*Tick.*
The spark plug comes out after popping off the cable lead with a screwdriver for leverage and then unscrewing it with a socket. When brand new the bit where the spark makes it's arc is whiter than my teeth. If it’s a dark brown it’s time for a change.
It’s black.
*Charcoal*.
Doesn’t take a mechanic to tell you that that’s fucked...
I’m surprised. Then I’m surprised that I’m surprised.
What was I expecting? All that Congolese cat piss you’ve been putting in the tank; all those day’s where it ran like a twenty year old dog...
If the spark plug looks like this, the cylinder can’t be far different, and that can’t be good.
I wouldn’t know where to start with cleaning that up...
Seems complicated...
Yeah, fuck that.
This is not “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”.
This is "Insanity and the Art of Getting it Done".
I *can* change the spark plug though, so that’s something, I guess.
The new one screws in just fine. But something weird is going on with the lead; it won’t make that satisfying neat little click noise as it goes back on.
Have I got the wrong plug type?? Don’t think so...
Right...
Fuck it.
*Tick.*
Moving on.
The oil filter lives in the engine cover, jammed into its housing like a jack in the box - a big spring in there under constant stress to make sure that no oil bypasses it.
Coming out of the housing it’s no dramas, just gotta undo the three screws that hold its lid in place without it coming flying out, but getting the new one in there is always a pain in the arse. Like wrestling a bear into a box.
I need three hands for this...
Through no special technique and just trying over and over again I get the bolts screwed back in without it all coming flying back out at me.
Not sure it sealed right...
Fuck it.
*Tick.*
The fuel hose linking the petrol tank to the fuel injector looks scummy and cracked like perished rubber, but it’ll last.
*Tick.*
Throttle “play” is a little bit too much – that’s how much you can twist the throttle handle before it actually picks up the throttle, basically the amount of slack in the throttle cable; how loose it is. Fixing that is as simple as tightening a little nut where the throttle cable connects to the motor's air intake under the seat.
Easy.
*Tick.*
All the rubber bits and hoses from the air box to that inlet stuff look ok. I reckon that the “replacement schedule” for all that stuff is way over the top; why replace it if it’s not broken/looking like shit?
*Tick.*
Air filter. Looks ok... I give it a clean out in some engine oil. I still feel weird about cleaning an *air* filter out with motor *oil*, but I know that’s what I’m supposed to do with this fancy type of filter. I leave that aside to drip dry.
*Tick.*
“Inlet/Exhaust valve cleaning: Inspect"
Shit.
Those are the valves *inside* the motor.
*How do I do that?*
I’d have to take the whole top off of the *bang-bang* part of the motor just to get at the valves. Looks complicated. Looks above my pay-grade. Looks like there’s lots of places to fuck that right up. Not to mention the time... We’re already nearly lunch time...
Fuck it.
*Tick.*
"Cylinder head/combustion chamber decarbonise."
Erm...
*Tick.*
Lunch!
*Tick.*
Clutch lever “play”. I tighten a little nut down by where the cable connects to a little pivot down by the gearbox housing.
Easy.
*Tick.*
It says to grease the rear brake pedal pivot. That’s not important. I whack a bit of motor oil on it.
That’ll do.
*Tick.*
Inspect the battery. Out comes the battery. Water level looks a little low. I don’t like mucking with that. Battery acid isn’t fun... Plus, it needs distilled water, that’s *distilled*, not *filtered* or *spring water* or whatever. Distilled water's the stuff you're supposed to use in a clothes iron, and it's the reason that we get all that white shit when we just use tap water.
Distilled water isn't a complicated thing; it's just pure H2O and nothing else. But finding it is tricky....
Fuck it.
*Tick.*
I whack some lube on the terminals. It's just Vaseline. I think that’s to stop them from corroding from water contact.
*Tick.*
Front fork oil change. Too hard. I’ve never done it. Suspension works fine as is.
*Tick.*
Chain play. That's a problem for when I change the sprocket...
*Half-tick.*
Rear brake play. It’s fine.
*Tick.*
Lube rear brake cam. I don’t even know what that *is*. Never done it. Rear brake works fine.
*Tick.*
Lubricate steering ball races. Again, no idea. Steering works.
*Tick.*
Spoke tightness. I ring a screwdriver around the spokes like a playing card in a pushy wheel and listen to the tune. If it doesn't make sounds like a wind chime and instead makes a dead sounding *thunk*, that's a problem, allegedly. They ring true.
*Tick.*
Swing arm pivot bush and spacer. That's what was giving me the willies before with the swing arm rocking from side to side.
I tighten the swing arm bolt up, with no effect.
The bushing must be fucked. Not surprising, really; the shit I've been putting that suspension through...
I don't have a new one, so that's that... Dodgy, but what can I do about it?
*Tick.*
Tyre wear. I'm not happy with the way that that back tyre's knobblies are getting chewed by the tarmac. It's a shit tyre.
I head over into the dealership to make enquiries. They've got nothing that's the right size.
*Tick.*
Service done.
Kinda...
Righto, now the rest.
Wait... The carb clean has fucked the metal of the engine housing! *Jesus*, it’s dissolved a bit of the metal engine case, has it? The surface gone from smooth to rough. *Fuck.* This is powerful shit! It’s already evaporated off so there's nothing I can do. It’s only chewed one type of metal. Plate aluminium maybe? Obviously some severe reaction going on there...
Should I re-paint it?
With what??
Nup. Fuck it. Let’s just see what happens.
Hope it’s not still being eroded away...
Anyway. Moving right along.
I unscrew the bolts and the whole engine cover comes sliding off.
Inside, it's pristine. Mint condition metal dripping with clean oil. Chalk and cheese, compared with the rest of the bike.
On the inside, I know that one of those things is the alternator, the copper coils are a dead giveaway. There’s also a rod poking through from the other side of the engine that does the gear changes. Other than that, I've got no idea what any of this is. There’s some cogs with teeth but not a whole lot else. The gearbox is on the other side of the engine. Which is good, because that means there’s less that I can fuck up.
Wait. I fucking *knew* it. I *knew* it! There’s supposed to be a black rubber sleeve on the end of that rod, that changing gears rod.
It isn’t there.
Don’t ask me why, but I had a nagging hunch that has dogged me way, way back, after the last time I pulled it apart in Ghana. *I knew it.* But I wasn’t about to pull it all apart again to check; I thought I was being paranoid.
I remember the English mechanics saying “whatever you do, before you put it all back together, make sure that this little sleeve is on, make sure that this little O-ring is in place. They’re important”
Didn’t do that last time. And now it’s not there.
Be fucked if I know where it got to. I wouldn’t have touched it last time, and there’s nowhere inside here that it could possibly go missing...
I'm not entirely sure what it’s supposed to do either...
I don’t have a spare.
Fuck it. What can I do?
I make a mental note of it and move on.
At least the little O-ring is there.
Gotta be careful from now on; anything that gets into this space is going to stay in the engine with the oil until the next change. Which is bad... I remember when we changed the sprocket for the first time back in England that the mechanics were supper particular about this: Don’t get shit in the engine.
But that’s gonna be tough; there’s still mud everywhere around the sprocket that was obstructed from view by the engine cover.
I spray carb clean over it as carefully as I can, but shit gets everywhere. I can’t clean this and keep the inner bits pristine. I do my best.
I get the camera out and go full paparazzi on the internals; you never know when they might be useful, particularly for remembering how it all goes back together again. Rough, I know.
The stator of the alternator looks weird. That’s the copper wire bundle bit. There's black string wrapped up in it for some reason. I don't remember that being there before... Like it’s been caught up in it somehow.
On further inspection, it doesn't look like it could have possibly got there by accident.
I check through the photo archives. I’ve never thought to take a picture of it before. *Damn it.*
New photo taken, moving on.
Sprocket.
I go to flatten out the little flap of metal that “locks” the sprocket nut down. And the sprocket nut *moves*.
Fuck a duck!
Shit a brick.
Cheeeesus H...
It’s not even *finger* tight.
Back in England I remember them tightening that nut with a spanner as long as my arm...
Now it’s just *floating* there! The only thing holding it where it is is that flimsy little locking flap of metal.
Fuck. If that let go... Jeee-sus.
How does that even *happen*?
How long has this thing been on the cusp of completely letting go?
Looking on the bright side, at least it’ll come off easy.
Silver linings...
Off comes the nut. I pull the sprocket out and compare it with my spare.
The old one has its teeth worn away, but not that bad. Subtle, even.
I want to keep the old one; going back down from 19 teeth to 18 teeth is going to make the top comfortable cruising speed 1/19th less. Which is, what? a touch over 5%? Doesn’t seem like much, but I’m going to be doing a lot of straight line, boring highway from here on out. I want all the advantages I can get...
I’ll worry about that later. Right now: Seals.
I’m keen to stop that oil haemorrhage. I reckon that the culprit is busted seals.
Pretty simple thing, seals; just a black ring of hard plastic that goes between something that spins, and something that doesn’t. Nothing technical. Basically stops all the oil from bleeding out.
The seal that I reckon’s had it is the one that goes between the shaft the sprocket sits on and the engine housing. I can get at it now that the sprocket’s out of the road.
I try to get it out with some pointy nose pliers.
I feel like I’m playing the game “Operation”…
The seal is doing too good of a job, it’s locked in there, hard.
I can’t get enough purchase on it to pull it out. But I *can* get enough purchase to completely butcher it.
If it wasn’t fucked before, it is now...
---
After ten minutes I’ve make no progress, except to gouge chunks out of the thing. If I can’t get this out, with the seal this fucked, the bike won’t make it down the road... I’m *pissed*.
Young chubby mechanic buddy comes round to ask what all the fuss and swearing is about. He wants to have a crack at it.
Why not?
He’s does exactly what I’ve been doing, just chopping up the seal.
While he’s here anyway, I ask him about the old sprocket.
“Do ya reckon it’s ok to keep using?”
He takes a good look at it. I show him where the teeth have been worn down. He says it’s still good. No worries. Just turn it around.
"Flip it."
I’m happy to be backed up. But I do wonder about the veracity of the opinion... I wonder if he knows what the fuck he’s on about...
He keeps hacking away at the seal.
Seems about as pro as me. Which is to say, a flog.
We’re not getting anywhere, he buggers off.
I stay at it; It’s gotta give eventually; there’s no alternative. I can’t win by just butchering it, or cutting it out, because the plastic is mounded around a steel spring. *Fuck this.*
A random bloke comes past.
He - roughly - asks me what I’m doing.
He’s not a mechanic; he's not wearing the kit. Rough looking bloke. Maybe not rough. Sounds rough... Maybe “*rugged*” is better. Three-day beard. Middle age. Yeah, bit rough. Windswept.
“I can’t get this *fucking* seal out." I keep hacking at it.
*“Stop.”*
He goes and grabs a big wrench, wraps it around the stainless steel pipe I'm trying to pull the seal off, and pulls the *whole lot* out.
*Who knew that that wasn’t connected??*
Not that chubby fat fucker, that’s for sure.
It’s not a pipe, like I thought, more like a little collar, and the seal has come out with it.
Now it’s as easy as pulling the seal off with his fingers.
“There you go.”
“Uh, I didn’t know it did that... Thanks. Thanks a lot.”
He nods and goes to leave
“Hey, are you a mechanic?”
“Yeah.”
“What do you think of this sprocket?”
He looks at it for half a second. Less.
“Completely fucked”
Well, it’s hard to get more definitive than that...
“Completely fucked?”
“Yeah, completely fucked,” He looks at me enquiringly, not sure if I’m a little thick in the head. He sighs.
“Do you see all this...?” he points at the teeth. "that's fucked..."
He puts down the down the sprocket and picks up the chain. Feels the links and takes a close look.
“This is fucked too.”
“What? The chain??” No way... But he nods. "Mate, that chain’s brand *new.*"
“How can the chain be new? It's fucked. You’ve got to change them together; chain and sprocket. Wait... *You changed the chain without changing the sprocket?*”
“Ah, yeah? Why?”
“What did you do that for??”
Maybe I am thick in the head… School’s definitely not out. I feel like a kid.
“The chain snapped out on the road. I couldn’t do a sprocket change out there. It was only a couple of hundred kilometres ago...”
“Yeah, well, this chain’s fucked now” 
“But, I’ve hardly ridden on it...”
“I don’t know what to tell ya. You’ve gotta change the sprocket and chain together. Sorry, I’ve gotta go.”
And off he goes.
*Shit!*
Well. At least I’ve got the seal off now...
That silly chubby wanker was telling me to “flip it”. *Fuck’s sake.* What is it about folks and never being able to use the words “I don’t know” here?
It’s like they’re allergic to it.
“Flip it”.
Dickhead.
Anyway. That whole “links sitting up on the teeth and then pop down into place” thing - combined with the crazy tightness - must’ve turned two hundred kilometres into twenty thousand...
Right then. No use crying over spilt milk...
I go over to the dealership to enquire about a new chain. They don’t have anything on spec. That’s a bit shit.
I’m not about to go on a wild goose chase through Windhoek for another chain when the chain I’ve got is still working.
Bugger it. I’m running out of time.
The new seal goes on even tighter than the first one. Which, I guess, is what I was going for, right? But this one feels *way* too tight. Like, I've-got-the-wrong-part sort of tight...
*Shiiit.*
Out of time.
*Tick.*
I flick out a similar seal on the gear lever where it meets the housing with a flick of a flat-head screwdriver. New one goes in. Feels like it fits.
*Tick.*
Right. Now. Put it all back together...
Sprocket slides onto the shaft. Can't tighten it till I've got the chain on (otherwise it'll just spin).
I undo the rear axle and slide all that forward, put the chain on the two sprockets, slide the wheel back to tension the chain, lock it up tight.
So much fucking easier with the right tools, when you're standing up, and it’s all right in front of your face, and there’s no white-hot exhaust pipe.
I whack one hand on the rear brake pedal to stop things from spinning and torque the shit out of that sprocket nut with a monstrous spanner. No chance that’s coming loose. Ever. Up goes the lock flap.
On goes the new engine cover gasket - which is just glorified cardboard cut-out – and then the whole engine cover on after it. It’s tricky; if you don’t get it just right the gasket will fold, or miss the mark, and you’ll get a leak. I can’t see what I'm doing, there's too much motorbike in the way of getting my head in there to look.
I think I’ve got it right... But there's no way to test it.
*Tick.*
On go the skinny bolts that hold it in place.
Oil.
I go and ask what they’ve got. *Nothing’s on spec.*
And I'm running out of day...
I need an oil spec of 15w50. I’m not 100% on what that even means; I think it’s to do with viscosities at two different temperatures? Or the other way around? Nothing to do with quality, anyway.
Not sure I want to roll the dice here though. Plus, here the spec some weird "SAE" format. I’ve got no fucking clue what that means. No one here can give me a straight answer either.
Nup. Time to take a walk. Hunting petrol stations.
---
First station is a negative. SAE.
Second station, same again.
Third one, same again.
I must’ve walked a couple of k’s by now, and I’m getting further and further away from the workshop.
It’s getting late.
What else can I do? I keep walking.
---
Fourth one, right on the outskirts of the city.
*Yes*. Victory.
20w50.
That’ll do.
I buy five bottles and head back to the workshop.
---
Must’ve taken me over an hour. It’s a lot darker on the walk back to the workshop than it was on the walk out...
When I get back, the lads at the workshop are wondering where I’ve been.
They’ve cleaned up. Ready to go home. *Waiting for me.*
*Shit!*
Time to move...
I dump four bottles into the sump and that’s it pretty full on the sight glass. Seems about right. Happy to have a spare bottle in case I haven't patched the leak and it’s still pissing oil.
Right.
Done?
I give it a looking over. Making sure I haven’t missed something obvious.
I've got an audience. An impatient audience.
Throttles and clutches and nuts and oil levels and tyre alignments and rear wheel...
I spin the rear wheel again...
*The wheel won’t spin.* At least not freely.
What?? Nah. What’s going on??
Brakes? Is the brake stuck on?
No.
Spin. Stop. Spin. Stop.
In neutral? Yep.
What’s going on? It should spin almost as easily as the front wheel does...
...
Blanks... I’m drawing blanks.
I haven’t *touched* the rear brakes.
Shiiiiiiiiiiit. *SHIT!*
I’ve got no idea.
I’ll have to figure it out later, or hope that it sorts itself out...
It’ll still roll. And I've gotta leave.
I roll the bike off the lift and roll it around the workshop.
I can’t *feel* an appreciable difference. It’ll be ok.
I throw my kit on, jacket, gloves and helmet, while I’m thanking the guys who are left over for letting me use all their stuff and for being patient and just, thanks for everything.
Half my head is still trying to figure out why that wheel wont spin. It’s either something in the rear wheel, something in the chain, or something in the sprocket...
I turn the key and let wait for the whirr of the fuel pump to finish. I hit the ignition.
*Nothing.*
I hit it again.
Nothing. *Not a sound*.
I hit it *again.*
Silence.
Shit fuck shit what the fuck??
I’m in *deep* shit now.
I turn the key off, wait, turn it on again - wait for the fuel pump - hit the ignition.
Nada.
*What the fuck?*
The battery’s connected, otherwise the fuel pump and lights wouldn’t work.
Spark plug? It never clicked properly when I replaced that lead...
I shove on that.
Hit the ignition.
Nothing.
...
Blanks. Mental blanks.
I’ve got *nothing*.
Neither does fat fuck mechanic. Not sure I’d trust him anyway.
I fiddle with everything. Throttle, clutch, move the steering around, flick around the headlights, move the choke. Useless shit. I know it is.
I can hear in my head an old quote from Einstein; something about the definition of stupidity being "to do the same thing twice and expect a different outcome." Or something like that...
What else can I do? I’ve got nothing but stupid left.
Turn the key off again, turn it on again. Hit the ignition.
*Click-a-click-a-click-a-boom! Boom boom boom...*
Alive.
*None of that makes any fucking sense.*
Right. Fuck it. It works.
Get out of here.
---
On the road and something feels wrong. Off. Weird. Not right.
Don’t know what it is.
Might just be me...
Fifteen minutes and we’ve made it to the hostel. No dramas.
I get off, whack the Shrike on its centre stand and spin the rear wheel.
Now it’s really, *really* stuck. Seizes up much quicker than before. Like. Locked up.
And something’s making a squeaking noise when I force it to spin, like there’s a mouse trapped in the gearbox.
*Faaaaark.*
While I’m playing with it I draw a little crowd from the hostel. Standing around me and the bike while I lie on the floor and try to figure this out.
One of them is a real weird fucker who’s been here at the hostel longer than I’ve been here. I reckon he’s here permanently. He's on the other side of middle age. I reckon his eyes are fucked too - he’s always looking *past* me. Half blind, maybe.
You’ve never met anyone more casually racist in all your life. Some of the shit that’s come out of this blokes mouth... The yarpy’s a fruit loop. And that accent... fuck me. Normally, it’s a little funny, but on this bloke it’s like someone whining while running nails down a blackboard.
Anyway, my mate, he wants to know what’s going on, so I give him the story.
“Oh, it’s definitely the chain”
Right. *Thanks...*
Over the next ten minutes it goes from being "definitely the chain", to definitely the wheel alignment, to the axle, to the sprocket. Free advice from dickheads who have no idea what they're fucking talking about. Like a pack of hen's clucking away. It’s fucking infuriating.
I try to take the attitude that this is great practice for dealing with wankers, but that’s wearing thin, and quickly...
Anyway. I reckon that squeaking’s coming from the gearbox. And that’s probably not good.
I’m spinning the wheel with my foot and listening with my ear to the engine case. Homing in...
It’s the seal.
Yup. *Definitely* coming from that seal I replaced.
“It’s the seal” I say.
“You should put some Vaseline on it”
“What? Is that a joke?”
“No, you should have put Vaseline on it, why didn't you do it?”
“Yeah, alright mate, maybe next time.”
There’s nothing I can really do about it, short of waiting here another few weeks for a new seal to come in, and then do the exact same thing again...
Nope. Going to cross my fingers and just hope that it "wears itself in". That’s about all I can do.
Fuck I wish someone would show up in a truck, heading to Cape Town.

## Chapter Sixteen
No truck.
The moment I realise that it’s time to go soon, all that good work - the last two weeks of starting to feel better, to feel a little bit like me again - disappears.
I’m right back in the gun again.
I can’t think straight again.
I can’t walk straight again.
I’ve got no excuse to stay any longer in Windhoek. There’s nothing left here to wait for, nothing to do.
I’ve been here much, much too long already.
As much as I don’t want to, it’s time to go.
---
I’m not feeling that bad as I ride out of the hostel. I’m scared but not terrified. And it’s weird...
I *should* be terrified; odds on that something will fuck up today. Bike won’t start, wheels wont spin. What are the chances that the Shrike will even get out of Windhoek without crapping out? let alone the next town down, which is a half day's ride away.
Not good.
Nothing left to do but have a crack.
*I’m over it.*
If the bike craps out, if the slightest thing goes wrong, I’m ready to light a funeral pyre, throw the bike on top of it, do a little dance around it as everything burns to the ground, and call it a day.
*Fuck all of this.*
---
No noticeable change.
If there is any squeaking coming from that seal, I can’t hear it. Probably because of the thump of the engine and the wind roar in my helmet.
Not a whole lot going on out here in middle-of-nowhere Namibia... Pretty empty. Pretty bland.
It’s weird. But the blandness isn’t freaking me out. It’s uneventful out there, and it’s uneventful *in here*.
No idea why. But it’s nice.
I pass the Tropic of Capricorn. The tropics of Capricorn and Cancer are the lowest and highest points on the globe where the sun can still pass directly overhead. Bet you didn’t know that.
The last time I passed the Tropic of Capricorn on the ground I was at home.
It makes me feel like I’m close.
I take some shit photos.
---
Before I know it I’m in Mariental, today's stop.
When did that happen??
The clicks just flew by...
I’ll take that.
I check in at a pretty swish guesthouse by the highway. Only $N200. Twentyish bucks. Not bad.
---
There’s bugger all to do here. Town’s like this are just flat out depressing. I spend the hours trying to get out of my own head, watching TV, and reading Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, which if you haven’t read, you should.
Drop this book and start reading that instead.
Anyway. The Shrike’s fine. Actually, riding really well. Surprisingly well.
Superbly, in fact.
I don’t think it’s ever felt better.
I don’t know whether it’s the new sprocket or what, but the bike feels even better at high speeds, when the math say's it shouldn’t.
Everything feels *planted*, even up over eighty. Usually, around eighty, it starts doing some bone rattling, like it’s going to shake itself all to pieces.
I’m baffled by the change in performance, but I’ll take the free win.
I take an early dinner of a pizza, so glutinous that I can only eat half of it and I feel like I’m going to blow it up again all over the table. The toppings are an inch thick!
The tight-arse in me says “finish the fucking pizza, and just don’t eat anything for the next few days”. I’m worried about making a scene...
I eat another slice.
Then go hibernate.
---
Today, *Keetmanshoop.*
It’s gotta be my favourite name for a town this side of *Nouadhibou.*
I don’t know why, but I keep saying “Keeeeeet-maaaaaan-shooooop” over and over again in my helmet in a deep voice.
Maybe I *am* losing it...
I skip yet another one of Namibia’s “must see's” - Sossusvlei - which I can spell, but not say... Apparently it's spectacular. I don’t care. Not one bit. I’m heading south. In a fucking *beeline*.
Straight highway. Gunbarrel straight. Boring-as-fucking-bat-shit straight.
Nothing but time and distance and nothing to fucking do but look at the road, all the way off to the vanishing point.
Enough to drive anyone nuts.
There’s a loud, *very loud* whirring coming from the rear tyre. Like it’s flat or underdone, or just dying.
I can’t tell.
The only pressure gauge I have are my thumbs. They tell me that everything’s ok. Dunno what the noise is, then.
Maybe the bearing’s in the wheel have gone to hell? Maybe it’s just the noise that these tyre’s make on this sort of tarmac?
Impossible to tell.
These tarmac miles is doing an absolute number on the knobbly tyres. It's being chewed off at a rate that I can notice.
Just gotta chalk it up and get on with it, I’ve got no spare.
KEEEET-MAAAAAN-SHOOOOOP….
Today a short ride, but I’m taking a million stops. Taking it easy. Staying fresh. Staying on top of it.
---
By the time I get into Keeeeeetmaaaaaaanshooooooop I must’ve taken my helmet off and put it back on maybe twenty times. It’s scrubbed my ears off and worn holes in the tail of my eyebrows, to the point where I don't bother to take it off to fill petrol and check tyre pressures.
Pressures are fine. Go figure.
Keeeeeetmaaaaaaanshooooooop seems alright. Colonial-ish. Biggish.
At the first accommodation option, I rip my ears off only to get told that they’re fully booked. Rip the eyebrows off to put the lid back on.
Same story for the second one.
By the third one I feel like someone’s given me papercuts and then lifted me by the earlobes.
*Fuck this.*
This joint’s gotta stick; I’ll be fucked if I’m putting that helmet on again.
No one's home...
*Fuck.*
I’m yelling. *Loud.*
Someone rocks up. They look a little shat off at the disturbance.
Despite this, they’ve got a room for me, with a double bed, *two* single beds, a serious shower, a flippin *bath*, and a full kitchen, all for me, all in the same room, all immaculate and all brand spanking new, all for $N290. Thirty bucks. That’s three times what I’m in the market for, but it’s too good to pass this up, and I’ll be fucked if I’m putting that helmet on again...
*Sold.*
---
I stay for two nights.
A rest I didn’t really need. But took it anyway. Best to pace myself. What’s the rush?
I've spent hardly any time out of bed.
Not proud of that.
To make that image worse, the commonwealth games are on, and all they’re showing here in Namibia is the rhythmic gymnastics. Over and over and over...
Yep.
Not a good look...
But, anything’ll do to distract myself from my self.
---
After two days of watching tiny humans prancing and flipping about on a mat it’s time to move on again.
It’s tempting to make today a monster ride.
The border is only three hundred kilometres away, not the four hungee that I thought it was.
I can do that... Tempting...
Nup.
*Don't even think about it.*
Cut it in half. Baby steps.
Two days of small rides. That’s easy. And the only village on the ride is smack bang in the middle. Perfect.

## Chapter Seventeen
It’s fucking freezing this morning. Coldest day in memory. By a long shot.
The sun is bright in the eyes, blazing, the sky is absolutely spotless, yet it’s as cold as a witch’s tit.
The air's not catching any of the sun's bright rays, and neither am I.
We sure as shit ain’t in the tropics anymore...
The Shrike's not too happy to get started, but it starts.
I give it a long time to warm up in neutral, and take off.
---
My hands are useless.
It's only been ten clicks, and they're as good as wood.
These thin, fingerless leather gloves don’t do shit.
My finger’s literally won’t move on instruction, they’re just clawed onto the handlebars.
I’m glad the road is straight and long and featureless; I’ll be buggered if I know what would happen if I needed to use the brakes...
The shivers are constant.
A big, violent shiver, and I the bike wobbles under the force, gets out of shape, and I nearly fucking bin it.
*This is ridiculous.*
I pull over and run. Run and run and run. Like a loony, swinging my arms in time with my feet like I’m swimming the butterfly.
After five minutes I’ve got some circulation back in all of my fingers except one; the ring finger on my right hand is still as white and cold and useless as a corpse's.
I keep running.
Hard to say what’s going on with my feet, though it still feels like I’m running around on wooden clogs.
That can’t be good.
Another 5 minutes, and that’s about as good as it’s going to get...
I jump on the bike and by the time I’m up to top speed I’m already shivering again.
That air is *biting* cold. When it’s this fucking freezing and moving over you at speed, it chills to the bone in *seconds*.
It’s almost worse after warming up; the blood has been coaxed back into the capillaries only to be promptly turned to ice again, and I feel colder than I did before.
*This is fucking shit.*
---
It keeps being fucking shit.
It never warms up, and neither do I.
Another one of Namibia’s must-see’s, Fish River Canyon - the second biggest canyon in the world after the Grand Canyon - comes and goes, a mere forty clicks to the West.
I know forty clicks is nothing - nothing at all, to see the second biggest canyon in the world - But I *can’t*. I know it’s ridiculous. I know it’s wildly irrational. But I never even consider it.
I ride right on by.
---
I take a hundred breaks to stave off what I don’t reckon I’m being overly dramatic in saying is hypothermia. And so the light jaunt to *Grunau* takes me to well on the other side of lunch.
Grunau’s tiny.
Small enough that it almost shouldn’t exist. A handful of nothing buildings.
Based on the size of the font that they’ve given it on the map, it would seem to be the biggest place this side of Keetmanshoop...
Yeah, righto.
Gives a bit of an idea just how much of anything there is in this part of the world...
Which makes it surprising (and delighting) that they’ve got decent accommodation that even has a *restaurant*.
Stoked with that.
The restaurant is shut, and I’ve missed lunch, so I go hungry. There literally isn’t a single thing to eat in Grunau till the restaurant re-opens for dinner.
---
I can write again.
I can write again and stay lucid, stay feeling like *me.*
The room doesn't spin. 
I write everything I can fit. Everything I've been wanting to write for weeks. I get it all out. *Everything.* I don't know when I'll be able to write again...

## Chapter Eighteen
Today’s a big day.
A massive box to tick.
*My last border crossing.*
The end. The last country.
“After this there is no more, Jimmy”
The first village in South Africa is a place called Springbok, which is a great name.
It’s a long way, a long ride, a long day in the saddle.
Plus a border crossing...
Two hundred and fifty clicks. I haven't ridden anything near that distance in a long time...
But there’s no real option; there’s bugger all in between here and there.
---
On the road. I’m nervy.
There’s fuck all out here. No traffic. No nothing, just same old boring, flat, featureless Namibia.
The Shrike’s behaving weirdly; It’s just a feeling. In top gear like this, where we’d usually be cruising, things feel slower than they should. Like we're in the wrong gear, but we’re not.
Are the clutch plates slipping? It’s the only place between the motor going "bang" and the wheels spinning that the bike could lose some speed, where things could, mechanically, slip. Everything else is locked in.
I’m not even sure how to visualise that.
Or is it just my perspective that’s off?
*Who knows.*
All I can do is worry about it.
And the last few days the Shrike has felt on point, running superbly. So what’s all this?
---
As a hundred odd kilometres roll by under the wheels it seems to sort itself out. I think.
---
The next fifty are just about getting there.
---
And then we’re here. Finally.
Namibian Police wave me down before I even get into the post. Which is novel.
I leave the bike in neutral, just idling.
“What do you want?”
That’s him asking... Not me.
Aggressively, too. What the fuck mate? I’m not even *in* the border post yet.
“What do *I* want? I’m going to South Africa.”
“Why?”
“Because I want to...”
“*Where* have you come from?”
“What? Today?”
“Yes.”
“Grunau. Grunau?”
“Where have you come from with this bike?”
“England.”
“How did you get it here?” Fuck’s sake mate, what do you reckon?
“I rode it.”
“No, how did you get it here from England?”
He doesn’t believe me. Why would I lie? What I want to say is “What the fuck is it to you, mate, I don’t have to explain myself to you, ya twat.”
I pull out my passport instead and give it to him “Have a look at that.”
He leafs through. Take’s his time.
“All *this*??”
“Yeah.”
“On *that*??” That makes me chuckle...
“Yeah.”
He wants to shake my hand. Now we’re best mates.
“After you’re finished, you give this to me” He points at the bike and hands me back my passport.
"No worries mate, but you’ll have to get in line!"
I’m into the post.
---
I head to Immigration. They’ve got paperwork and twenty questions for me.
Fucking annoying.
By the time they’ve asked me where I *entered* Namibia I want to yell at them “I’m *leaving* for sucks sake! Just stamp the bloody passport!”
My answers are all vague. Intentionally vague.
“Where did I enter? Somewhere in the north.”
“But which border post?”
“I don’t know.”
“Ok, where did you stay?”
“What? Where did I stay?”
“Yes.”
“I stayed in Grunau last night.”
“Ok, where before then?”
“I don’t know.”
“You don’t know?”
“No.”
Etcetera...
Eventually I wade my way through the layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and questions and paperwork, and I get stamped out.
I avoid Customs; I need nothing from them.
I get out of Namibia.

## Chapter Nineteen
South Africa.
We’re finally *here*.
The RSA side of the post looks proper modern.
I don’t like modern. It implies organisation. Organisation is my enemy. It means bureaucracy.
I head to Immigration. It’s schmick.
I wait my turn and then front up to the woman behind the counter and hand her my papers.
She leafs through my passport. Doesn’t look up.
“When will you go back to your home country?”
“What the fuck is it to you??” Doesn’t get said...
“I don’t know.”
She looks up; I'm not sure she gets that response very often...
“O-kaay...”
She gives me back my passport.
“Ok?”
“Ok.”
Fuck...
Done.
No paperwork.
Poor girl’s job must be mind-numbingly boring...
I’m *in*.
I jump on the Shrike.
We pull out of the post, but get waved down by the cops on the way out.
They want my passport.
Leafing though.
“Where will you stay?”
“In hotels.”
I think they were after a location, not a smart-arse answer...
I’m sick of the fucking questions though.
The cop's cogged that I’m not going to be putting up with any shit. He hands me back the passport and I’m in, in. *Properly* in.
That’s it.
No more borders.
*Never, ever again.*
---
Straight away it’s a huge improvement over Namibia. But, really, that’s just saying it’s a huge improvement on a sensory deprivation level of nothingness. Which isn’t setting the bar all that high.
It’s weird. They must’ve decided that where the hills start is where they’re going to draw the border lines; the road's immediately gone from dead flat to a little hilly, a little green. Things to see. A bit of colour.
The roads are still gun barrel straight. The slight tailwind of the morning has turned into a hard headwind, and it's absolutely bitchin'.
It doesn’t take long till I’m exhausted. The constant buffeting of the wind makes it feel like I’m going twice as fast as I am; I've even got to get a bit of a tuck going.
---
The road just goes on and on and on.
I feel like I’m making no progress. I don’t think I’m going to get to Springbok. But there’s nothing between here and there. Absolutely blank on the map and on the landscape.
I feel the desperation drip in, building with my fatigue.
And on and on it builds as the road slowly crawls past.
I feel like I'm treading water...
I take a break, and walk it off.
But it doesn’t help.
---
The closer I get to Springbok the more frantic things become.
I’m terrified that I’m going to melt down before I make it there.
I was always hoping that when I got to South Africa I’d have a little relief.
With nothing to do, nothing to worry about except getting the miles done. I could be in Cape Town in three days. I could relax a little.
A little respite.
But that’s not going to be the case, apparently.
I grind it out. With ten clicks to go till Springbok it’s getting late in the day, with the sun disappearing behind the hills. And I’m knackered.
Absolutely spent. And as my energy depletes my anxiousness rises. Till I don’t think I can deal with being on this bike anymore. In my head anymore.
I’m swooning in the saddle. So woozy it’s getting dangerous. I can’t sharpen my mind. I can’t control it...
---
And then I’m here.
Springbok.
Suddenly the infinite time feels short again.
I scope out a place to stay...
Accommodation options are thin on the ground. One place has no rooms for me. The other place, a hostel, looks like it should be open, but, after pushing the buzzer forever it’s apparent that it’s not open. With no way to call them I’m wondering if I should jump that nasty looking gate and have a snoop around inside.
Nope.
I wait it out. There’s not much else to do.
I don’t want to get on the bike again.
---
After a long half an hour I’m rewarded for my patience. A big heifer rocks up. She seems shitty to see me, like it would have been easier if there was no business today.
Don’t worry, love, I’m not thrilled to be here either.
We head inside.
It’s shit.
I’m the only one here.
Zero anything.
The place is just a big shed with beds. All I can think of is how fucking cold it’s going to get tonight, and that bedsheet is so thin...
But, beggars can’t be choosers.
Once shacked up and with nothing to do I go to write something.
I write the date, the place, and then the line “Well, here we are! Made it to the end country”… and then, a complete meltdown.
From tired to insane in seconds.
Like I’m not only about to fall off the bed, but fall off *everything*.
Utter terror. Full blown fight or flight response. Fizzing adrenaline. The overwhelming urge to run to somewhere safer. Anywhere that's not *here*.
I’m losing my mind.
I’m going to write about it.. I hover my hand ready to write. And... I’m going to be sick.
I’m losing my fucking mind.
What happens on the other side of this?
I can’t write a single letter. To write anything would be to admit it. To admit it is to make it real. And I can’t do that. I can’t. What would happen if I did?
The irreversible is the terror. The utter fear that something is going to happen that can’t be undone. Ever.
I leave.
Walking.
Out of the hostel. Fleeing.
I walk and walk and go get something to eat. Distract myself. And things start to get a little more normal.
*I can’t keep doing this*.
I’m not going to make it...
And it happens, again...
---
I hate Springbok.
It’s not at all like I expected. I expected - and wanted - a big modern city. Like my home, or maybe a little smaller, but something *like* that.
This is a *town*.
Maybe not even that...
A couple of roads and some streets. That’s it.
But I can’t leave.
I’m shitting my pants that I’m going to crap out like I did last night, but on the road.
I came good last night, after a while. If you can call *this* “good”, which it’s not. But it’s taken its toll, it's done it’s damage. I need to give my brain a break. It can’t take much more. I can feel the doom coming.
So, I take a long, long walk.
I head to the top of a mountain that this "town” sort of sits in like a bowl.
Takes a good hour.
To greet me at the top is a monstrous phallus of a monument as big as I am tall, carved out of stone. What it’s doing here is anyone’s guess...
I take a photo, and future me is scathing; when it comes time to go back through the photos of the trip, hopefully many years from now, I reckon I’m going to be disappointed in my choices; hardly any Africa, zero humans, just weird stuff. Giant monument to cocks makes the cut.
I head back to town.
Eat lunch.
Spend the afternoon looking for things to distract myself with and find nothing. This joint is just a hole.
I head to the hostel and I can’t write. I can’t read.
I stare at the ceiling for a few hours.
Then sleep.
Break: Achieved.

## Chapter Twenty
Three riding days to go.
Three more destinations.
*Three.*
All the time in the world to do it in.
Today: *Vanrhysndorp.* I can’t even say it.
Somewhere between two hundred and three hundred clicks south.
It should be a cakewalk. But I don’t feel good about it.
*I don’t want to get on the bike*.
Well rested brain or not, it feels like I’m being *conditioned* to hate it. Every time I go near the bike I’m repulsed by the idea of riding it.
I’m scared for my safety. Less and less the physical, more and more in the head. I don’t feel that “I” am safe when I’m on the bike.
“I” feel like it’s going to change me.
And I don’t want to change; Not when I don’t know what that change is, or what life looks like on the other side.
It’s the *event horizon* of my mind, the point at which I can't see beyond, and I want to stay the fuck away from it.
Every time I get on that bike I feel it sucking me closer, like a goddamn singularity.
I should be feeling chilled out; South Africa was supposed to be a victory lap. But that's not it at all...
It's a fucking grind. But there's no other way to do it; every inch needs to be done sitting on the Shrike.
Better get to it.
---
Closer and closer to Varhyswhatever it’s just *ramping*. Out of control.
I have to take more and more breaks to separate it out. To kill the exponential rise. But each time I feel more panicked when I put my helmet back on, till I start to feel physically repulsed as I squeeze it over my ears.
---
Last break; thirty clicks from Vahryblahblah, off comes the helmet, and I take a long, long walk.
I’ve parked on top of a little crest in the road, and for everywhere I can see - in every direction - there’s nothing.
Utterly alone.
I come back to the bike; there’s nothing left to do but to get on it.
It's only thirty clicks... But I can't do another second...
I can’t breathe enough.
The breaths come easy, but it’s like it’s coming through a straw, till I’m sucking in full lungful’s through my mouth, on my haunches.
I can’t get back on the bike. I *can’t* make myself do it.
My face twists up.
It’s happening.
I’m breaking.
By reflex, I look wildly, *franticly*, for somewhere to flee to. 
Escape! *RUN!* But there’s nowhere to hide here.
It crashes into me like a king wave. Obliterating me.
I lock up my jaw as my whole body shakes itself apart, like standing epilepsy.
I can’t think a thing. Can’t articulate a feeling, a thought; the terror has fogged everything except the need to flee *this*.
It endures, and endures, and endures, while I uselessly crawl my rattling hands back and forth over the Shrike. Looking for something. Something to help. Something to make it stop.
My body can’t endure it. And turns it off.
Minutes later, I’m crouched next to the bike with a hand the handlebar, another holding my face. And something, strange, like a soft release, spreads quickly, gently through me. Like a drug. It feels amazing, that softness, like the greatest drug no one’s ever taken.
I’m still Me.
Foggy, scared, but *Me*.
I really thought that that was going to be it...
I can’t do that again...
Something’s going to give.
In the softness, I don’t resist when I put my helmet on, there's no repulsion. I get on the bike, and go.
---
Vanrhysndorp.
I've been drowning myself for two days in television and the Commonwealth games. I only leave my hotel room to eat.
I reflect on what happened out on the road. The *episode*.
While it was happening, it was happening for *eternity*. I mean that literally. It's not a metaphor. Because the future is eternal, and, while I was in *it*, there was no way to know if it would stop, so, possibly, it might not, and if it does not, then what I was enduring never ends.
That’s forever.
Not knowing the future is what stretches moments into true eternities, not because that’s how long the moment lasts, but because that’s how long it *could* last. It’s a thing of the mind. While in that moment, while living it, it *is* eternal. And then it’s not, and it feels short again. But while *in* that moment...
Fuck.
I feel like failure - *catastrophic* failure - is imminent. Not only imminent, but almost inevitable. Like an impending, fated doom.
As I’ve got closer to Cape Town – my goal, my finish line – the tension, *my tension*, seems to be ratcheting. Every day. Every click. Always ratcheting tighter, and never going backwards.
Never slackens.
I can't believe I got back on the bike again...
I feel like I got lucky, to be able to close the distance and make it here to Vanrhysndorp without snapping in two.
What scares me – not on the same level of fear as going beyond that mental event horizon, but fear nonetheless – is that I’m going to make it within sight of Cape Town, and through no external forces, I’ll fail.
Just like shitting myself when I saw the islands on that fucking boat in Guinea-Bissau. I saw the finish line and my body decided that it had held out long enough... Cue the fire hose...
I've travelled more than thirty thousand of the toughest clicks, and I'll fail in the last few hundred of the easiest...
I’ve seen it before: blokes who do ultra-distance ironman races. They've been swimming and riding and running for double-digit hours, and then fail when they’re in sight of the finish line. After hours of exertion and with only seconds to run and they fail.
I fear that a capitulation, this time, in similar circumstances, will be far more disastrous than that overboarding in Bissau. To fail now... it’d be something I couldn’t live with.
But, whether I can live with it or not, I can feel that the urge to accept failure, to give up, is ratcheting as we go. And ratcheting with it is this *thing*. It's all going to hell in a handbasket.
In a marathon, it feels incrementally more impossible – with every single step it gets harder – till it’s over.
Like the ironman and the finish line, the boat and the island - all that can save me now is Cape Town. Only two more rides...
Far more than for “success” – far, far more than that – is because I can’t keep feeling *this way*; I just can’t.

## Chapter Twenty One
The road to Picketburg isn’t long, but half of it is under construction. That’s a shitload of construction.
The road isn’t bad though and when I get some cruising up it’s a nice meander around the mountain ranges, which have gradually become more and more interesting since crossing the border.
Despite it being a short day with nice sunshine and decent, distracting views, I never feel far from total panic.
I hate being on this bike. Every minute is a minute of feeling fucking terrible.
In actual fact, this ride is absolutely superb; most mountainous roads are.
Not long ago, a ride like this – this constant bending with no need for brakes but always rolling the throttle - would have had me grinning like an idiot, would have had me bouncing in the saddle and making stupid noises in my helmet. Like a happy moron.
Instead, I can’t wipe this tense grimace off my face. It won’t go. I’m so fucking wound up. And it’s a travesty. Just a wasted opportunity to enjoy what is one of the great rides of the trip.
Makes me feel even worse.
Instead of wishing this road would never end, I’m wishing the miles would pass faster, get me to Picketburg sooner. Instead of savouring it, I want to skip it.
Every minute the tension cranks itself.
---
By the time I roll into Picketburg my teeth are on edge and I’m borderline fucking frantic.
Picketburg.
This is it: the *final* pit stop.
One stop from final destination.
I shack up at a B&B that’s basically just someone’s old house and they've given me one of the rooms. It's a bit weird to be living with a stranger. But they’re old so, yeah, no worries.
I head out for a late lunch and just for a meander. I feel the need to shake that morning off, somehow.
It just fucking clings to me.
Walking down the main drag of this tiny nothing town I come out of my own head and into the real world in a snap.
Something’s got my back up... and my skin crawls just a little...
I look about me. Despite the broad daylight, this place is *dodgy as fuck*.
Pissed drunk people everywhere with punters passed out on the pavement. Not pretty. At all.
*All eyes are on me*.
*All* the eyes.
Not nice eyes either.
What the fuck is this about then?
I puff my chest out and make myself walk tall. I give my best “don’t you dare fuck with me” face. More like the “don’t even fucking think of talking to me, don’t fucking dare” face. It’s basically just a malevolent squint and a pulling at the corners of the mouth. “go ahead, punk, make my day”.
I’m *shitting* it.
This has snuck up on me, bigtime, I never thought that after all the places I’ve been so far, that Picketburg would feel the dodgiest...
I’ve walked through the market quarter of Lagos, alone. I’ve been in the whore-houses of Monrovia, for fuck's sake.
It’s palpable. I can *feel* these jokers sizing me up.
*Fuck this.*
I quick step it to the local supermarket and calm down over a tub of yoghurt.
Crisis averted.
Note to self: Be behind locked doors before the sun sets.
---
After whittling away the sunlight hours in conspicuous places I come back to my room to stew my brain for the night.
Escapism doesn’t even do the job, while I eat my dinner of bananas and apples and more yoghurt, watching a movie, I can’t stop a tremor in my hands. It’s cold, but it's not *that* cold...
I can’t write. Every time I try I feel like I’m going to slip over some *edge*, as though thinking too much is dangerous. I push it away.
I’m ratcheted to snap.
*In my heart, I know that I’m not going to make it*.
One half day. A quarter day, even. And that's it.
But I know that I’m not going to get there.
I can feel that it’s not going to happen.
Something will break.
---
I can’t sleep.
I don’t.
I’m exhausted, at the end of my tether, but my heart keeps smashing in my body. Enough that it makes my body wiggle while I lie - otherwise still - in bed.

## Chapter Twenty Two
This is it.
I’m up before dawn.
I mechanically eat, putting food in my mouth, and I wait for the sun to come up.
There’s an old mirror on the wall. I look like I haven’t slept in weeks. Haggard. That beard... it doesn’t do me any favours...
I look like an addict of something.
Unwell.
Sick.
It hurts to look at myself.
My teeth are clamped down and the back of my throat is squeezing, the back of my cheeks pinching.
It’s time.
---
It’s freezing cold. *Bitterly* cold.
It’s so foggy in this huge valley that the air has a density to it. A *thickness*. Like air soup.
*I can’t see shit.*
The gate at the end of the yard is obscured. Forget about seeing the house across the street...
But I have to go.
If I don’t go now I’ll stay.
And if I stay, well, I don’t know what would happen next...
The frozen, wet Shrike behaves. It always has.
It's been so damned good to me. We've gotten this far, together.
This is it. This is finally it...
I could cry.
I must be tired...
I hit the gears and we roll out, and away and towards the highway.
The wind-chill of the wet air is diabolical.
In the frosted, white air the glare from the cone coming out of my headlamp is almost counterproductive; I can barely even make out the road markings, and when a rare car comes the other way? Forget about it.
*Blinded.*
My only goal is to make sure that I'm not somewhere between those two oncoming beams of light.
---
I have to stop after ten minutes.
I’m not equipped for cold like this. Not even close.
These fucking fingerless gloves... My dead digits are saturated in icy dew. Wooden, corpse cold.
Nothing I can do to warm up either. I’m numb to the bone and bloodless.
I get back on the Shrike and slog on.
---
After a half hour the dim light has turned into something less opaque.
The fog starts to get burnt off by the sunshine.
It’s still bloody cold; my fingers still don’t feel like they belong to me, but I’ll be alright.
I stop regularly, I check *everything*.
My heart won’t stop smashing in my fucking chest, won’t give me a rest. It’s exhausting. I’m so tired of this.
---
Hours.
---
And then, Table Mountain.
*Cape Town*.
I ride into the city.
I'm watching myself, I want to savour the exact moment when it ends, know it, and note it; the moment when it leaves me; when I shed it off.
When it's *done*.
I get to the hostel I’ve booked.
I roll into the car park.
Pull up the Shrike.
Turn off the key.
I sit there in the quiet, in my helmet.
I feel *nothing.*
I just sit there. Waiting for it. And, nothing.
I feel the same.
Nothing’s changed.
It hasn’t fallen off me.
No happiness, euphoria, satisfaction.
No sense of achievement.
*Nothing.*
I’m still *me*.
As I lean the bike onto the stand and swing my leg off, I know, that no matter what I achieve, no matter what the dream, no matter how *hard* it was to get, no matter the sacrifice, no matter what I do, I’ll always be me.
Me. In *this* sack of skin. In *this* brain.
It doesn’t matter what I do, there’ll *never* be another option.
Unescapable.
Here I am; I’ve done something that I never ever *ever* dared to think I could ever do - and I feel *absolutely nothing* about it.
What possibility is there in a life like this?
Nothing will ever be good enough.
I unload the Shrike - for the last time - and shack up.
In what should have been my greatest triumph, I'm at my most disappointed.
Staring into the abyss.
I never, ever, *ever* have to ride a motorbike *ever* again *for the rest of my life*.
I really thought that that would be it; that once I didn't have to ride anymore that things would go back to normal. I thought that was what *it* was waiting for; the end.
Yet, obviously not.
*It’s* not that at all, then...
*Then what is it??*
Part of me wants to investigate this new detail about *it*, about these *episodes*, and what it means that it's not related at all to the ride... but that feels like dangerous territory... Places better left alone.

## Chapter Twenty Three
I do nothing.
*Weeks* of *nothing*.
I can’t...
The sphere of things I can do without having problems is shrinking more and more, every day.
Every time I step out of the sphere I feel like I’m going to collapse. The world spins around me and I go out of control.
It’s terrifying.
Today I was doing my laundry - a hop, skip and a jump from the hostel - and I felt like I was about to blackout. All I was doing was watching the dryer go round and round, and I swooned in my chair like a drunk. Lurching up to my feet, I stumbled back to the hostel to lay down in my bed - my only safe place - and left the washing behind...
Yesterday, I was out having a coffee and reading a book when *it* happened. I was trying so hard to read the words - just *read the words* - but I couldn’t. The page didn’t make sense. Like my brain was at 1% capacity.
Can’t. Read...
I felt like I was going to fall off my chair. The *need* to get back to the hostel, back to my bed, was utterly overwhelming. When confronted with a line at the cafe's paying counter I skipped to the front, threw them ten times what the coffee was worth, and without waiting for change quick stepped it back to the hostel and to my bed.
If I can’t do laundry, if I can’t even read a book, how will I get back home? If I can't do the simplest of tasks, how will I catch *two* planes??
More and more I think that it’s going to be more likely that my family are going to have to fly over here to help me back, or else they’re going to have to put me in a hospital here for people sick in the head.
I can’t see me getting home under my own steam.
That said, the other night I went out and had some drinks with some French backpackers from the hostel. We drank a fair bit... and I felt *better*.
For a couple of hours I felt like me again. *Normal* me.
*I wasn’t scared*.
It was a blissful window of normality. I was chatty and friendly and having fun. A brief respite from the constant feeling of terror; the *always there* feeling that something is about to go wrong; the feeling that I'm very not ok. *Gone.*
A slippery slope, that one... and I know exactly where it ends.
The once confusing world of alcoholism makes perfect sense now; it works.
I don’t drink again.
I shave my face. It’s a lot of beard; a years’ worth, maybe, which, when you look at it, is pretty damn pathetic.
I didn’t care how I looked for the whole of the last year through Africa, but now, here, I'm suddenly self-conscious. I care again. Backpackers will do that...
I’ve been sleeping twelve hours a day.
Sleep: It’s the only place I feel normal. Or, at least, the only place where I’m getting a break from *it*. Sleep; my only sanctuary.
Lots of it.
A normal day I’ll get out of bed up at eleven or twelve o'clock (after waking up and forcing myself back to sleep four or five times.) Breakfast of muesli at the hostel. Take a shower, which brings on *those* feelings for some reason - like my body is somehow a half an inch outside itself, and my brain is trying to keep up, just swooning around on the spot. Never still. Showers are the worst, they scare the shit out of me.
I fucking hate it.
It’s like when you step onto an escalator that’s not moving, and it feels really weird for a half second. It’s just like that, but *always*. Every second, I'm walking around on a broken escalator.
Then a few hours of staring at rectangles. Then lunch at a rotisserie sushi place down the road from the hostel. Then back to the hostel for a half a day of rectangles. Then off to get some dinner, which is invariably from the circuit of close-by fast-food chicken or fish and chips or some Thai food places. Then back to the hostel for more rectangles till somewhere around midnight, then go to sleep for another twelve hours.
I’ve seen practically nothing of Cape Town.
I know it’s a travesty, because from the little I’ve seen, it’s an unbelievable place. Like, *jaw dropping* unbelievable. It’s Valhalla, but for real.
But the cue is in the rack. I’ve seen enough. I’m basically killing time as best I can till I get clearance for the Shrike from Australian Customs to be able to ship it home.
Till then, I need to stay as safe as I can. I'm holding all my reserves in wait, so that I can get on that plane, and get home.
It's all that matters. I need my family.

## Chapter Twenty Four
The sphere has shrunk to zero.
*This is it*.
I'm in my bed, my safe place, I've just woken up, and I'm *shaking* - violent as epilepsy - from head to toe.
I can’t stop it.
*This is it*.
This is where it ends.
I try to make my body like a board, tensing up - to make it stop - but it’s completely out of control.
I shake and shake and shake and *I can’t stop it*.
I’m panicking. And it gets worse, I shake harder.
I shake till it hurts.
It keeps hurting...
Then it’s over...
It comes off.
*I need to leave*. I can’t stay another day. Not another *second*.
Or I won’t make it home...
I get out of bed and I’m still getting aftershocks. My hands won’t behave.
I book a flight for 4pm. *Today.*
*Now.*
Cape Town – Johannesburg. Johannesburg – Home.
I pack my stuff. Give away my tent and my padlock and a few bags to a young bloke at the hostel who, after hearing my stories, reckons it’s a good idea to ride a motorbike through Africa. He’s even bought a cheap Chinese piece of shit that’ll do just fine. Good on him. Anyway. After handing on the baton to him, I grab a taxi.
My protégé gives me the finger and a smile as we pull away. I have to smile. Charming lad.
I sit in and try to hold it together.
---
Airport.
All I need to do is hold it off till I make it onto the second flight... Well, the second flight, and then halfway back home... Well, however far the plane needs to go that they won’t turn it around and head back to Johannesburg when I start shaking.
*I can’t stay in Africa.*
I can’t let them bring me back. All I need to do is keep the lid on till then...
Breathe. Just breathe.
---
Boarding - Cape Town.
I’m ok...
My heart is smashing and my body is swooning and I’m panicking... But I'm ok...
Buckle your seatbelts.
All I need to do is sit here...
Just sit. Let the plane do the work.
---
Joburg.
I brush my teeth and buy a bottle of wine for the family.
Boarding…
Buckle your seatbelts.
Lift-off...
And that’s it.
Africa.
The Shrike.
Gone.
But I’m still me.
*Nothing’s changed*.

Epilogue
Home. In the airport.
I made it.
Taking a piss before picking up the packs, there’s an advertisement in front of my face while I relieve myself:
“I am the hot and cold flashes that confuse you when you’re already confused enough”
“I am the tightening in your chest”
“I am the snowballing worries that become an avalanche in an instant”
"You need to know anxiety to be free from it. #knowanxiety"
"BeyondBlue."
That sounds familiar...
This is way, *way* beyond just anxiety though. This is a complete breakdown...
I go get my stuff. They let me back in the country despite my bags and my riding gear still being covered in shit from all the way back in the mud baths of Congo, and despite Australia being the most highly strung country for quarantine in the planet, they wave me through. Not sure how I feel about that...
Cab.

Home.
Old home.
Two in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I’m not going to be able to get in...
I knock on the door.
My younger sister answers the door and it’s weird.
Maybe it’s my face...
It's like neither of us knows quite what to do, it all feels a bit unnatural.
She seems more shell-shocked than surprised.
She was about to head out the door - kind of in a rush, probably late, if nothing’s changed - so off she goes and the house is just empty.
I lie on the floor, looking at the ceiling. On the carpet of the house that’s familiar to me.
This is *home*.
*I feel nothing*.
I was so sure that home would change everything...
But I’m still me. Same skin. Same brain. Same eyes.
*Nothing’s changed.*
My silver bullet. A blank.
Nothing.
I lie on the floor for a few hours.
Dad gets home.
Shits his pants a bit - he wasn't expecting a grown man in the house - but once he realises it’s his son he gets very excited about it.
I don’t know why I was expecting everyone - including myself - to be emotional, but no one is. I’m not. In my head I thought it was going to be so much more. I think it’s my face; I must look like shit.
There's no tears, just surprise.
I reckon everyone’s just shocked.
Mum gets home to me and dad in the kitchen. She’s confused, and then, *recognition*.
Her face scrunches up and her body goes into a standing fetal position as she starts to sob, all by herself.
It’s the only time I’ve cried.
It feels more like home now.
---
I tell them everything.
That I’m not ok. That I think I’m very sick.
They want to help but there’s nothing that they can really do.
Mum gets free access to social workers with her job, so we book that.
Mum gives me a fistful of Valium and I sleep.
Nothing’s changed.
Except that I’ve lost my safe place; now I’m not safe even when I’m sleeping.
It’s just rolling episodes of smashing hearts, fizzing heads and utter terror.
*It’s getting worse...*
I'm home, and it's not going to stop...
---
I go to the social worker. She listens to me while I spill my guts. *Everything* comes out over forty minutes of me just giving it the verbal diarrhoea. I can’t stop talking till finally I feel like I’ve told her every factual thing about what’s been going on, anything that could be of value, every last detail.
I pause.
She tells me that I don’t have enough magnesium in my diet.
I’m going to black out...
*Magnesium*?? Is she fucking serious.
I tell her what I think of that...
But on the way home I go and buy the biggest bottle of magnesium tablets at the pharmacy I can find. I might as well be thorough... Can't hurt...
---
I look up things online, *BeyondBlue*, and I identify with *everything* that they say. Every fucking word.
So now I have a word for it. *I’m calling it*.
It’s *Anxiety.*
I hate the word. It’s not appropriate. It’s too fucking innocuous for what *this* is.
Being *anxious* doesn’t sound anything like what I’ve got.
*What I am is fucking crook*.
Anxiety is when you’re a little stressed out, or nervous, or I don’t know...
Anxiety, to me, isn't a big deal. It's weak.
It *should* be called "the Death Spirals". Or "standing mortis". Or the "Oh-Shit-You're-Fucking-Dying syndrome". Or "Brain Paralysis".
Anxiety? Pffft...
My *episodes*, they’re called *panic attacks.* Again, not strong enough.
But every word of *what it is*, the actual *what* of anxiety and panic attacks, resonates with me in a way that *I know that this is it*.
What I’ve tried so hard to describe, it’s all here. That feeling...
I book in to see my doctor, because that’s what they tell me to do.
---
I can’t drive myself.
So, mum drives me.
All the places I’ve been... All the miles through all that slog... Africa! *All of it*. And I can’t drive for fifteen minutes to get to the doctors around the corner...
For fuck's sake.
What’s happened to me?
I’m sitting in the waiting room next to my mum. I haven’t done that in a decade. But, unlike a decade ago, I’m happy she’s sitting next to me.
“Luke Gelmi”.
I don’t recognise Doc James. It's been half my lifetime since I've been here. I don’t reckon he recognises me either... He reckons I look like my dad. Spitting image, apparently.
After practising my speech with Mrs Magnesium I give Doc James the summary, and my self-diagnosis.
He reckons I’m right; It’s Anxiety.
That’s all.
Anxiety.
I don’t know if I believe it yet... Doc James doesn’t either. So, just to be sure, it’s a full battery of blood tests and a brain scan.
If that comes up clean, says Doc James, then it's Anxiety for sure, and we can treat Anxiety medically. Take tablets called "beta blockers". It’ll stop the symptoms.
"Don’t worry, you’re not unique - *it’s very common* - and it’s very, very *treatable*."
Not arriving in Cape Town; not getting on a plane; not my family; not anything could give me relief. Finally. I have it. *It’s going to be ok*.
This is what I’ve looked for. Been *dying* for.
Doc James is still talking...
"...can medicate but I'd recommend the non-medical course, which is getting therapy."
I don’t want to depend on tablets for the rest of my life just to be ok either... Therapy suits me to the floor.
Thank you, Doc James.
Coming out of the doctors, nothing’s changed, but everything’s different.
After months of guessing, of worrying, I have a name. It’s a thing, *it’s an actual thing that exists*, I’m not making any of it up, I have it, and I can get after it.
The feeling of utter fragility, that the slightest knock to my peace of mind could send me to the loony bin: Gone. Dispelled. *Dismissed*.
---
Blood tests done. Brain scan in one of those things that they tell people they’ve got cancer when the results come back from, done.
Brain scan reveals nothing...
No kidding...
---
I cried with my mum, I cry again with my best mate. Seems right.
---
Doc Kathy’s not a doctor, but she’s a *doctor*. Not "MD" doctor but PhD doctor. Promising.
Everything’s been the same, but the understanding - *the what* - has changed my attitude entirely.
I’ve been catching up with friends. I’ve been telling everyone who will listen that I’ve got an Anxiety problem. I’ve been so scared that admitting that I had a problem would open the floodgates, unlock a box of insanity, but instead it's opened the floodgates like a release.
Every time I talk with someone, it’s like sharing with them a piece of the burden that I've been carrying all by myself. It’s a tiny piece - they wouldn’t even notice it - but for me, spreading it amongst everyone I know has made a difference.
I’ve been having raging, *heavy* panic attacks. It still *feels* like I'm dying. It's probably even worse than it's ever been. But it’s ok. All the terror associated with *that feeling*, the not knowing what happens next, has been taken away.
All I want to know is what is my plan of attack... Should I do what my head is telling me to do? Go somewhere safe? Or do something else... Defy the feeling that tells me that I need to be somewhere safe? What would make it better?
*I want to get better.*
I head into Doc Kathy’s office still covered in a bit of sand from surfing this morning; I came straight from the beach.
I should call her Kath, and she doesn’t mind the sand...
Where’s the lie down couch? Where I lace my fingers over my chest and tell her about my childhood? Two plain chairs facing each other is not what I expected...
I sit, I tell her everything.
---
“Shit Luke, you don’t need magnesium, you need therapy!”
“Yes! Thank you!! *Shit*. Right?? *Magnesium.* Fuck's sake...”
By the time we’ve got to magnesium the session which run’s for an hour is practically over.
She tells me that I’m not going crazy.
That I could walk into the mental asylum - *right now* - and they’d say “you’ve just got Anxiety, get out of here”. They literally wouldn't let me in.
It’s a big deal that’s not a big deal.
*It’s going to be ok.*
Panic attacks can’t hurt you. They come, they suck, they go. The body can’t support a permanent panic attack, it’s too exhausting. Ten minutes – absolute max.
So no matter how bad a panic attack is, understand that it won’t last, and that it can’t hurt you. That’s as bad as it gets.
When you do what the panic attack is telling you to do, you exacerbate it. You make it worse. If it’s telling you to run away, to hide, to find somewhere safe, if you do what it says it learns that that’s the correct response.
So, next time - whatever you’re doing when it happens - keep doing it. Just go on doing what you would have been doing had it not happened. Yes, it’s gonna suck, it’s going to feel fucking awful, but it can’t hurt you, and it doesn’t last. So, just keep doing what you were doing anyway, and watch it! *Watch* your thoughts, follow your thoughts, what are they saying? See where they go, watch what your head is doing, don’t suppress anything, watch how it feels and how you think as it comes, watch the feeling as it stays a while, watch the feeling as it goes. Watch it all the way to the end.
And stop checking your pulse all the time...
Don’t look for signs that one’s coming.
Just live.

After our fifth session a month later, and talking about the practical application of what I’ve learnt, it’s time to go.
“I pronounce you, 'cured'”.
I kind of knew it. I knew it a few weeks ago, if I’m honest. But these sessions have been the highlight of the week. It’s like I’ve been overflowing for months and months with the need to share *everything* with someone. It’s weird, but I think I’m in love with Kath.
Nothing’s changed. I'm still me.
*But everything’s different.*
---
Right.
What now?
I've taken all of the jenga out of my life... I guess it's time to start a new game... But first...
The Shrike.

THE END
