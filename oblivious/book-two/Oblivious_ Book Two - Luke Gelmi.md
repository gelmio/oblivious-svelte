## Chapter One
Freetown. The capital.
Giant billboards start to pop up.
Things like a giant cartoon condom flexing its muscles “I am Mr. Condom. Trust me. Use me. I will protect you from HIV and STI’s”.
I can't help but laugh.
I know it's an important message. But wow. *So* bad. Credit where it's due though, it's the first time I’ve seen any sort of effort to educate the masses on health and well-being. So, props to them for having a crack.
Not long after, I pass a sign post for an outer-village: “Welcome to Devil Hole”.
Unbelievable.
Infantile behaviour aside, on the other side of Devil Hole we're jam packed in. A heaving mania of traffic and heat and colour. But, amazingly it all manages to flow. The bike and I are whisked alongside colourful markets and filthy slums, which are leaking some awful shit straight into the ocean.
To think that back when I was a kid, I wasn't even allowed to walk past the end of our street...
_Now, look at this crazy shit._ The streets are jam fuckin _packed_ with colour and people and _noise_.
It's a gridlock of humans. A mosh pit of them.
The bike is melting a hole in my jeans, and dripping oil everywhere while the mid-day sun smashes down on my leathers and I stew in my juices.
_We're not in Kansas anymore..._
Freetown.
Sierra Leone...
Blood fuckin Diamond in proper West fuckin Africa.
_The_ wild wild west.
I muscle my way through the pile. The thump of the bike is finding competition for attention with the rest of the cacophony, so much so that no one's really making room for me.
The whole place is *pumping.*
Hope it's not like this all the way to my accommodations...
---
I rock up at the front gate of 'Chou’s parent’s house'.
Who is Chou?
I don't know.
Other than sounding familiar, Chou is a local guy that JB (our mate the Brit on the KTM) met by chance _way_ back in Guinea-Bissau. A chance meeting, because Chou said that JB could stay at his folks place if he ever made it to Freetown; something similar to the arrangement that we had with that family back in Ziguinchor, which we both loved. JB said I'm welcome to join him. Bonus.
I bang a fist on the big metal gate. The place looks like it's a prison; solid metal gate and big concrete walls and barbed wire on top. No seeing in, no seeing out.
I bang again. Nothing.
I yell.
I bang.
A young bloke opens the gate. About my age. I say hi, apologise for the banging, introduce myself.
His name is Kenneth.
We blankly stare at each other.
Ah. _Okay._ So I wasn’t expected...
_Awkward._
“Arrr. I’m JB’s friend. Um, I think he's expecting me?”
Kenneth lets me in, more like a guest of JB’s rather than a guest of his.
I’m uncomfortable. I hate imposing on people. It makes me squeamish. This doesn't feel cool.
_JB’s not here._ He's out and about.
Kenneth and I hang out for a bit with just small talk. He doesn't mention staying here. Neither do I.
JB finally shows up. He hasn’t brought it up with the family, he's just made the assumption that it’d be cool.
Yeah, _not cool._
This feels gross; like I’ve thrust myself upon these poor folks and demanded their hospitality.
_We don’t know these people from a bar of soap._ Why should they offer us their hospitality? It doesn’t feel fair.
Kenneth say’s it’s up to his parents, I want out. All of this is making me squirm. I tell him it’s all good, I’ll just head to a hotel, it’s no big deal. But now he won’t have that; he’s _insisting_ I stay.
I insist back, but he won't budge.
*Fuck.* Now I'm in that bind where if I don't stay it'd be rude.
We head inside.
JB's sleeping in the master bedroom; the bedroom of Kenneth's parents; _in their bed_
*So fucking weird*.
The family have apparently shuffled their sleeping arrangements; the parents have kicked their kids out of their beds, Kenneth is on the couch, his brother, Jimmy, is on the floor.
Apparently they insisted that JB stay in the marital bed. They got really offended when JB refused it. JB just wanted to pitch a tent in the courtyard...
Kenneth's mum gets home. She insists that I, too, sleep in the master bed.
That’s the only arrangement she'll have.
Well, this is just plain weird now...
I argue, but I’m hamstrung by the hospitality. I'm so uncomfortable with this on so many levels.
Stuck. Trapped.
They're _too_ kind.
Take a bow, Sierra Leone...

## Chapter Two
This is the first time I've shared a bed with someone with a penis since I was six.
We wake up to a massive English breakfast.
It's easily the best breakfast I’ve had on the continent.
I feel awful about it; this is obviously not "par for the course" around here. I hate the special treatment.
I make up for my embarrassment with the most effusive praise I can muster, really laying it on with a trowel.
JB, meanwhile, hasn't been offered a full breakfast... He's busy eating some cereal that he bought the day before. The family seem *pissed* about that.
There’s a tension here that I can’t really describe. Maybe it’s just me, but _I_ feel tense. A weirdness. _There's something yucky about this..._
And I hate it. _Gotta get out._
So, that’s the day's plan: _Find an alternative._
Scoping out the potential accommodation options should take me on a walking tour of the whole city.
_That suits me just fine..._

## Chapter Three
Freetown is _awesome._
Parked on a mountainside, it's a big shanty town that ends at the ocean, and it's bristling with colour and action and music.
It’s pretty. It’s ugly. It’s modern. It’s old and shitty and grimy.
There’s money. There’s poverty. There’s a little bit of everything, and a whole lot of Africa.
Funny that this place scared the shit out of me just yesterday.
From break-out-in-a-cold-sweat-and-crap-your-pants to now: freely walking the crazy city streets, eating at the markets, squeezing through the crush and scrum of the locals as they go about it in the heat of the day. I feel as safe as houses.
It's a delightful surprise; I can’t wipe the smile off my face.
_What a place._
Surprise number one: People line up for things. _Unbelievable._ People, actually waiting patiently in line for buses or taxis or anything. _That’s unique;_ lines are normally treated the same way that they are by Asian tourists: non-existent. Here, people get served in the order that they arrived in. It's refreshing.
Next surprise. They seem to give a shit. About stuff. About improving their standard of living. Or at least trying to.
They have *bins*.
Now, that’s probably not going to sound like much, but Africa doesn’t _have_ bins; they have streets.
_Filthy_ streets.
The sidewalks and roads and gutters are, everywhere, full of rubbish. _Choc-a-bloc._
Not here...
I remember, way back in Morocco; I was having a sandwich with Ben the Aussie hitchhiker, and when he was done he just casually dropped his rubbish onto the ground. I was disturbed. His reply to my shock and horror was “yeah, well, you’ll change...” It didn’t take long either... After a few weeks of carrying my rubbish around, looking for a non-existent bin, I distinctly remember the first time I gave up and chucked my rubbish onto the ground. Ben, with a smirk, just said “finally”.
Since then I’ve been littering everywhere I go.
Having principles is great, right up until you’re put into a situation where they become utterly impractical. You either have to suffer for it or adapt. I'm more than a little ashamed to say I've changed. But, "when in Rome" and all that jazz...
The Africans sure as shit don’t care one iota about the cleanliness of their streets, or give a shit for the environment in general. There’s a lot of other shit to worry about, like _getting by._
So, yeah. Bins. Pretty big deal. Go Sierra Leone...
When I say "bins" by the way, I mean an open skip parked at the end of the streets. But hey, it's a start...
The streets are still filthy – culture and habit take a while to change – but at least they are making an effort.
Speaking of making an effort, there are billboards with painted public health service announcements all over, and a lot of the walls in public spaces have been painted with cartoons of the same; thing’s like HIV/AIDS awareness, practising safe sex, advice for pregnant women, directions to health centres specifically for young pregnant women and mothers, safe food practices, personal hygiene tips, how not to get cholera; you know, all the good stuff.
The "how to spot cholera" paintings take the cake; the way to spot cholera is "if it’s flying out of your arse, that’s cholera." Pictures and all...
I feel bad for laughing at yet another serious issue, but how can you not??
The power and electricity here comes and goes, and the water is more often off than on - just like everywhere else - but I'm still impressed.
They’re having a crack.
They’ve exceeded all my expectations.
---
The long day's walk around town is a big success; I've got accommodation in the bag. I end the day with sunset on the beach.
Freetown is the first genuine beach city this side of the Sahara. The beach itself is one of those ones that give you the feeling that once upon a time it would have been spectacular, back before the colonists came and fucked it up.
These day’s it’s a little bit trashy on the sand, and you have to spend a bit of your time looking at the ground to make sure you don’t step on something you wish you hadn’t, but that doesn’t stop the beach from being a hub; the long beach, off to a vanishing point, has every square inch occupied for beach soccer.
It’s clearly the local obsession.
Watching them play, you've never seen fitter humans.
They're chiselled from stone. Not an ounce of fat on them, and with muscles like anchor ropes. Perfect posture.
Bloody impressive.
No one’s ever wearing shirts either. It's disturbing. _Horrifying._ They have *the-most-fucked-up* belly buttons in the world.
_The whole world._
I don’t know how, or why, but the majority of them look like they’ve got a dick hanging out of their bellybuttons.
_Believe it._
A limp dick.
Hanging out where their belly button should be.
It's _revolting._
My best guess is that it’s the result of not cutting the umbilical cord properly when they're born, which then turns into a fleshy appendage.
I'm terrified that all the girls have them too... Unseen... It makes me want to retch.
I turn my eyes back to the ocean.
There are a handful of people swimming about.
_Fuck that..._ Have they _seen_ the river of Christ-knows-what that’s oozing out of the massive slum just around the corner? No-thank-you. Not for me...
The sunset, though, is spectacular. Watching the sun disappear over a wide, calm, blue ocean reminds me of home.
As the day dims and twilight comes on, I get my first reminder that this was - in the not too distant past - a war zone; there's a group of young men, all of them missing some or all of a leg, and they're all playing soccer...
One legged, with crutches, in the soft beach sand.
You wouldn’t believe the level of skill and _speed_ of these guys. _Lightning._
If I was playing and they were picking teams I reckon I would have been the last bloke picked; I couldn't have come close to matching their hustle.
I stand there, fixed to the spot in fascination and awe.
Impossible not to be inspired.
I stay and watch the match till it gets too dark to see anymore.
Time to go back to the weird place...
---
On the way back I picked up a heap of beers. Big, oversized, 10% alcohol, headache-in-a-can, beers; I figure it might ease up the tension back home...
As soon as I get in the front door and lift the sack of booze I’m everyone’s best mate.
_Mission accomplished._
After dinner, Mary - the massively overweight sort of step-sister or cousin or something - pulls me aside and says that we need to have a “family chat”.
Ahhh, god.
*What is this shit??*
Mary’s gotta be somewhere in her thirties and seems to be a bit of a firebrand with an unpleasant personality. Whatever it is she has to say I really don't want to hear it; I know already it'll be bitchy...
I’ve been here for one night and already we’re having “family chats”... Come off it...
She starts the family chat with no pleasantries; _teeing off_ on poor JB as an ungrateful mug.
*Why?*
The breakfast cereal.
“The Family” have seen it as him throwing their hospitality back in their faces, and have taken it _very_ personally.
I feel for the guy... Where I’ve been effusive and way over the top with my thanks, I don’t think I’ve heard him say “thank you” yet.
He never really stood a chance; he doesn't quite have the knack.
But Mary's just being a bitch. I can tell she fuckin loves it too; she’s not genuinely offended by it, it’s just a good chance to fire off some shots.
I back JB up as tactfully as I can and drop into the conversation that it’s a real shame I’ve gotta leave tomorrow...
Yeah, get me the fuck out of here.

## Chapter Four
Morning.
Before sliding out of 'Chou’s parent’s house' and back normal programming, I'm gonna have a crack at getting a visa for Liberia.
Liberia is the next country over, so it's crucial that I get it here, as there won't be another chance.
Liberia is, by the way, not *Libya*; in the same way that Mauritania is not Mauritius. Understandable to have them confused.
Anyway...
The embassy is decent, which is a little surprising, and I ask around for a visa.
I get given a few standard application forms to fill out; the usual questions. Add in US$120 and I can come back tomorrow to pick it up.
*Piece of piss.*
I ask the lady who gave me the forms what the cost for a Laissez-Passer for the bike might be; I figure I might as well kill two birds with one stone...
Four hundred _thousand_ Sierra Leonean _leones._
That’s a hundred bucks.
I can’t help myself; I laugh right in her face. _Hard._
_Fuck off._
I tell her it's ten times more than the most I've ever paid.
Ever.
She’s sticking to her guns.
I convince her to sort her shit out and go talk to “the boss”, the ambassador.
When she come back the price has, of course, changed. It's actually, 150,000 leones. A cheeky 60% discount.
_Just like that._
I laugh some more.
Crooked bastards.
I wonder how many they catch out... I tell her that it’s still _miles_ too expensive. She says it’s cheap.
I explain that it's *still* four times more than the most I've ever paid in all of West Africa. _How’s that cheap?_ She says “that’s Liberia”.
Whatever Trevor. I’ll get it at the border.
---
JB has had a big day of zero success.
He’s tried his luck for visas with Ivory Coast and with Ghana. Nothing doing... Apparently, Ivory Coast doesn’t issue visas in Freetown, full stop, "do not pass go, do not collect $200", while Ghana rejected him with the same old story that to get a visa for Ghana you _must_ apply in your country of residence, meaning that only Sierra Leoneans can apply for a visa here in Sierra Leone. Therefore, if we want a visa, JB will have to go back to England and I’ll have to go back to Australia.
*Good luck with that...*
I haven’t had a crack at getting this tricksy Ghana visa yet, but JB has tried it on _everywhere;_ he's been rejected the whole way down the coast.
I decide I’ll have a crack at it anyway: Where there’s a will - and patience and manners - there’s a way.
Some rules can be bent, others can be broken.
---
We're out of 'Chou’s parent’s house' with some pleasantries and gifts given.
And immediately it’s a weight off my shoulders.
We kit out our bikes and roll the short distance to the new digs; an old, run down two storey hotel. It's pretty pricey at $15 bucks a night, especially given that we've taken a single room with two beds... But, it does tick all the other boxes; it's got somewhere to keep the bikes; clean and tidy; close to town; secure.
And, there are showers.
_Joy of fucking joys._
I haven’t had one of those in months!
---
_Nirvana._
How can such a simple thing feel so bloody good??
When I get out my skin is all wrinkly. Not because I'd been in for too long, but that's just what happens these days when I touch water; ever since Conakry. It's weird; any contact with water, and my skin wrinkles like I've taken an hour-long bath. A little while later the skin swells and bubbles up like it's got air under it. Then, a little later again, it all flakes off.
*Every time.*
No idea why...
It's a little disconcerting...
_Anyway,_ dermatological apocalypse aside, I head back into town to the black markets to try to find a replacement for my smashed laptop screen that I busted back in Senegal.
---
_Not likely._
I've been handballed around for a few hours - in and out of dark dens of dudes pulling apart computers with questionable legitimacy. There are bits of old computer parts everywhere. Obviously they’re not going to have what I’m looking for but everyone promises me that _their friend_ will have it. I get dragged to the next place.
And so on...
One bloke tells me he’ll replace the whole thing for 1.6 million Leones. That’s... 400ish bucks; he say's to leave the laptop with him and he'll _fix it._
_Sure you will..._
The sun sets on the day and I've had enough. I pack it in and head back to the hotel.
---
We're going to be sociable.
Which is weird; I've very rarely the occasion to head out and experience the nightlife. Mostly because it's not my jam, and partly because I'm not the kind of guy to just show up at bars by myself and see what happens.
We walk the beach strip in the dark and pick out a random bar.
It’s a Monday, so the place is cleared out. It's not really a disaster; if we're being honest, all we wanted was a drink.
The joint's not at all upmarket, but it’s pretty flash for West Africa, I guess..
The bar is a big open building plonked right in the middle of the beach sand. The lights are flashing, the music’s playing but there’s nobody home... There are a few lads around but by and large the majority of the slim pickings of clientele seem to be dirty old white men and prostitutes. Well, “prostitutes” _is_ questionable, but the dirty old white men are undoubtedly dirty old white men.
_Yuck._
JB and I plonk ourselves down at the bar and order a couple of beers. Before I’ve even warmed the bar stool a girl comes over and unsubtly drapes herself all over me. She wants to know my name.
So, that’s a bingo on prostitutes...
I fucking hate this. I squirm on the stool.
Her name’s Christina. And she’s stunning. Beautiful. A classical beauty; huge dark eyes, big lips, high cheekbones, flawless skin. Over the top of these stunning features she’s slathered makeup so fluorescent that it’s almost neon.
She’s young.
_Much_ too young for this...
She's that sort of odd age where you couldn’t say, hand on heart, whether she’s 16 or 22.
I’m uncomfortable in a thousand different ways. Being accosted by a prostitute is my idea of a nightmare.
Christina's tenacious; she's not exactly picking up what I’m putting down...
It must seem to everyone here that this is _exactly_ what we’ve come here for; that this is even why we've come to Sierra Leone. We're dirty white men; why else would we be here?
_I feel sick._
No matter what I say, I’m still wearing Christina like a scarf. I've got my shoulders up around my ears, trying to shrug her off.
Now she’s getting in my ear about buying her a drink...
"I need to take a piss!!!"
I disentangle myself and go stand in the men's and do nothing for a few minutes.
When I get back she’s attached herself to JB, who looks happier than a pig in shit.
---
Blink.
_It’s 2am._
I'm drunk.
I’ve been drinking the whole time by myself after being abandoned.
The quiet observer, I just sit on my bar stool and sluggishly watching things.
They have the “Lingerie Football League” on the TV, which is actually hugely entertaining as a pure sport... _That's not a joke._ It's legit good.
The blue team are fourth down and goal; whatever the fuck that means...
A rank old drag-queen-looking prostitute crosses the floor and gets right up in my face. Like, _right up in my face._
She's talking all sorts of shit.
I tell her to leave me be, but she won't go.
I tell her again, but she's got me bailed up.
I'm *out*, I’m fucking *out of here!*
I shove off the prozzie and go find JB outside. He's got Christina curled up in his lap like a kitten. I tell him I’m heading off.
I haggle with the scooter-taxi boys over the fare back to the hotel, and then _fly_ through the dark streets of Freetown back to the hotel.
_Pissed as a chook._ I spread my arms and pretend I'm an air plane, swaying from side to side.
As I get back in and crash onto the bed, it dawns on me that JB's probably gonna bring Christina back to our room...
*Shit.* I'll have to make myself scarce if he does... I'll be buggered if I'll be in the same room while _that_ goes on...
So I stay up and wait for the inevitable...
JB gets home not long after me, empty-handed.
He blames _me;_ say's it’s my fault he didn’t _seal the deal_.
"What?! My fault? You need me to hold your hand to pick up a prozzie??"
"Prozzie!? What prozzie??"
"Christina..."
"Christina's *not* a prostitute!!"
"What?? Really JB? Come on mate, are you taking the piss?"
He's not. He's pissed, _and_ pissed off.
_Fight._


## Chapter Five
JB takes off.
We agree to tee up again before Nigeria - neither of us want to be solo for that shit - and he's gone.
Probably for the best.
He's been bloody good to me, which is more than I deserve; he's left me one of his cameras (I've been camera-less since the Dakar robbery), a water bladder, and some very handy waterproof bags.
I wonder if I've been nothing but a drag... A companion, and that's it. Where he has brought me so much, I feel I've given nothing in return.
---
I go and pick up my passport from the Liberian embassy with no dramas.
*Tick.*
I head straight from there to the Ghana Consulate and *talk the talk*. Using nothing but wit and charm I manage to get a meeting with the lady who is one rung below the top brass. I apply for the visa through her.
*This is gonna work.*
You little beauty...
---
I wander.
The markets are crazy. The food is fantastic; delicious green goo, some mystery meat and a bowl of rice. I’m loving being amongst it all.
I laugh my arse off at a random lady carrying a pineapple on her head. I swear, give an African woman a backpack to carry and she'll stick it on her head...
I go to buy some water to wash it all down, and the lady I'm buying it off smiles at my money and says “no no, this is *free* for my Muslim brother”.
*Oh dear...*
I *insist* that I pay for it, she insists back... I don't have the heart to tell her that, despite the beard, I'm not her Muslim brother.
I take the free water.
---
What's left of the day is dedicated to pushing shit uphill; blackmarkets, computer screens.
I look everywhere, all over town. No dice.
I'm sick of it, but, really, there's not much else for me to do...
I keep looking.
In a tiny computer store selling crappy old printers I ask, for the n'th time, about laptop screens. The guy opens a drawer, thumbs his way through a bunch of folders, and pulls out a brand new, *legitimate* screen that is made for my exact model of laptop.
*Un-be-friggin-leevable!*
I nearly jump on him.
What’s better is that he’s going to charge me 370,000 Leones for it, which at somewhere less than 100 bucks. *It’s a steal.*
Five minutes later we’re locked and loaded and it works, perfectly.
*Hallelujah.*

## Chapter Six
The sixth hour of staring blankly at a wall ticks by...
Ghanaian embassy; I'm headfucked, have been for a couple of hours...
I'm on the verge of cracking as they *finally* call me into the office.
They reject me. Just like that...
*“You must apply for a visa in your home country”.*
I plead, I *beg.*
No dice.

## Chapter Seven
Freetown in the mirrors.
I smash on down the peninsula. Bearing: south.
Today's the first day that the smoke or fog or smog or whatever it is has lifted off the city, revealing in all it's glory the blue ocean, the green mountainside and a gorgeous blue sky.
This is a very, very pretty place.
I’ve got high hopes for Freetown, I reckon it's going to do just fine.
The bike is still cooking itself in the sun and pissing an oil slick as it goes. It’s starting to make an oily mess of my saddle bags.
*Not good.*
Putting that aside, the Freetown peninsular is a bloody nice ride; the ocean to the right, good blacktop under the wheels, and mountains on the left covered in thick greenery.
This is just fine and dandy.
---
I see a wooden sign in the side of the road for *'No.2 River Beach'*. Hardly inspiring, but I’ve been told by locals back in Freetown that it's worth checking out.
Why not? I've got nothing but time...
I ride down the sandy side road till I hit a set of thatched huts with no walls that are set up right on the beach.
There's a teeny tiny little shantytown just around the corner.
I see some local surfers bobbing up and down on a surf break that is *Goldilocks*; not too big, not too small, but *just right.*
*I want a piece of this.* Oh yes...
I go ask the boss how much to pitch a tent in one of the huts for the night.
*200,000 Leones.*
Fuck off, mate!
That’s *fifty bucks.* Just to pitch my tent on a beach.
*Outrageous.*
I counter crazy with crazy and take a zero off the end of his price and pitch that back at him.
He doesn't like it...
*Let the haggle begin.*
In the end, we both feel like winners; 60,000 a day - that's fifteen bucks - *with* a surfboard thrown in.
*I’d make that deal.*
I unpack, pitch up, and sit on the sand.
This place is paradise. Truly.
I grab the surfboard...
Now, as an Australian, I'm legally prohibited from saying anything nice about any beaches abroad.
But this place? *Fwoar...* I've gotta break the rules.
The sand is *immaculate.* It’s so white that it almost looks like a shade of grey, and so fine that it’s like talcum powder, and so clean that it squeaks underfoot as I walk - then run - with my surfboard towards the water.
The leap at the waters edge feels like slow motion...
The water is a perfect flat teal with a swell breaking neatly across the beach.
The mountains surround the beach like a bowl.
The peaks almost seem to come straight up out of the sea.
It’s all achingly beautiful and utterly unspoilt. I set my mind to soaking in every single detail as I sit all alone in the crystal clear ocean, just me and my board, waiting for the next set to come in.
*Fan-bloody-tastic.*
The water temperature is “stay in all day”.
*I think I'll do just that...*
---
Two days straight; sunrise to sunset...
Thoroughly sunburnt. 
A confession: I’m shit at surfing.
Almost shit enough to say that I can’t actually surf. *That bad.* But that’s beside the point; no-one’s watching me out here; no-one's judging.
But, when I do put it all together - when I get it right - it's infinitely satisfying; a true, whooping thrill.
More than anything else, it just feels good to be using the body for the first time in a long time.
Sure, I can't surf, but I fuckin love the ocean.
*And this has been about as good as it gets.* 
But now, *I’m a train wreck.*
My skin shrieks at every movement. My spent muscles ache all the way down to the bone.
Sleeping on the ground hasn't helped me, I’m sure.
The idea of going surfing for a third day brings on an almost physical reaction. *Repelled.*
*I think that's enough.*
---
On the way out, I spot a white guy. How odd! That's certainly worth stopping for...
A bit of a hippie-ish looking guy, wearing long blonde hair and a pair of khakis. We get to talking.
He's weird.
*Really weird.*
In fact, he's just like me... One day he he decided to drive down here from the UK in his Landcruiser.
He points it out. It looks absolutely knackered... In fact, it looks completely fucked.
"Yep, it broke down. That was about, what? Ten years ago now? I think...?"
"You've been here for *ten* years??"
"Yeah. Yeah, I've got a wife and two kids."
"What? *Here??*"
"Yeah, yeah man I don't really know what happened... The 'Cruiser broke down here, and I just decided to stay a while y'know... Not sure when I'll get it fixed and go back home..."
*This bloke's not all there...*
Something about that smile; *straight out of an asylum.*
A cautionary tale, if ever there was one.
I wish him luck with the repairs and peel out.
Or... Wait. *Is he actually a genius?*
*Has he got it all figured out?*
He found his paradise, why would he leave?
As the beauty of the thickly wooded Freetown peninsula quickly gives way to cleared, sad, bulldozed land, I wonder: why am *I* leaving?
The road is in good nick, I open the throttle...

## Chapter Eight
Kenema.
There's a hint for Kenema hidden in the name...
Can you guess it?
Things have started to feel very *Blood Diamond-y*; the whole day's ride - all three hundred clicks of it - everyone walking along the roadside has had a big sifting pan on their head.
*Chasing diamonds.*
Every river I've crossed has people in it with their pans, sifting away.
This Kenema joint, it's a properly big village.
*Grimey...*
It seems to have it’s whole purpose wrapped up in diamonds. Buying and selling. There are shopfronts everywhere with diamond symbols painted on the front, “DIAMOND OFFICE” written in big letters.
After I’ve dropped my shit off at a cheap hotel (overpaid, at 50,000 Leones a night - about twelve bucks) I mop up my oily bike.
Some prick has stolen my can of spray on chain lubricant.
Fuckin *mug.*
I’m pretty sure it was one of those military jerks at one of the many checkpoints on the way here.
But, honestly, I don’t exactly *need* it; the whole bike's getting well lubed by that fucking leak...
Anywho, I've skipped lunch today and I’m bloody hungry.
Time. To. Wander.
---
There’s a young “big mamma” with a table and a bench on one of the street corners, selling chop. I chow down on a *massive* bowl of “cassava” which is like a potato (sort of), and some beans and sauce. It costs 1,000 Leones: twenty five *cents*. So cheap! So good!
I follow that up with some shortbread that I can only describe as vagina shaped. *Nom nom nom.*
I’m still not done; I smash down a massive sandwich filled with the greasiest deep fried egg in the world, plus some mystery deep fried balls which are probably just doughnuts.
*Dinner of champions.*
I fuck about in the shanty 'tetanus-waiting-to-happen' markets for a bit, but there’s not much to see or do. This joint is pretty much par-for-the-course. Though, that said, I’m still always a little shocked at just how filthy and grimy the corner of the market that sells fresh food is; grisly meat of who-knows-what animal getting hacked up by dull machetes; the hot, cloying air filled with swarming flies; mud on the ground that you slide on, that comes up through the holes in your thongs and gets in between your toes...
*Grimey as fuck.*
I head out of the markets; I want to go and check out a "Diamond Office". 
I've got to admit, they freak me out a bit, but, when else will I get the chance to look at a Diamond Office?
Gotta do it...
The place I pick out sells water pumps *and* trades diamonds.
*As you do...*
I get talking to a middle aged man who seems to be running the shop.
He's very keen to give me an education.
We talk raw diamond "grading". He’s drawing me pictures and everything, explaining to me the relative values by size, shape, clarity, and colour.
He tells me that all of the buying and selling is now regulated by the government...
*"All legitimate."*
I can tell by his tone that all this sentence is missing is a knowing wink.
I really want to see one of these raw diamonds but we can’t do that till I get the go ahead from “the boss”, *and he's asleep.*
That's a bit weird, not least because it’s just coming on dusk now... Why would he be asleep?
I ask him when they close.
“Never, we are open at night for people to bring diamonds.”
Right. *Of course...*
Small talk starts to take a more sinister turn; He seemed to physically twitch when I tell him I’m heading to Liberia...
*Really bad vibes.*
The questions start to have an edge to them...
*When are you leaving? Tomorrow??*
*Where are you going in Liberia?*
*Where are you staying tonight?*
*Which hotel?*
*I’ll come with you there... Let’s go,* now.
Heebie jeebies. *Big time.*
I can't cog it though; what the fuck is he driving at??
I run my head through my guide on diamonds in Sierra Leone: Blood Diamond.
I remember that Leonardo DiCaprio got put it jail at some point for smuggling diamonds into Liberia...
*Does this guy want me to smuggle diamonds into Liberia??*
Nah. *Surely not...*
Diamonds or no diamonds, I'm sure as shit not hanging around to find out...
I deflect his questions, tell him I'll be right back, real soon, and fuck right off.
*Smoke bomb!*
I look over my shoulder a few times on the way back to the hotel to make sure I'm not being followed.
*Yuck.*

## Chapter Nine 
*Today's the day.*
Liberia.
Baby heart eating, child soldier shooting, crimes against humanity Liberia.
Nightmares aside, all border crossings give me the jibbers, *and this one's bound to be a doozy...*
*I'm shitting cinder blocks.*
According to the maps that I’ve got, the only road that looks like it’s going in the right direction from Kenema to the Liberian border goes for about a hundred clicks and then stops at a dead end.
A road to nowhere.
I ask some locals on the ride out, and they *kind of* confirm that it *should* be ok, it *should* get me to the border.
I'm unconvinced.
I try to explain my misgivings to them using my maps, but this just seems to utterly confound everyone; don’t ask me why, but this happens *all the time;* maps always confuse the situation.
It's like no one's ever seen a map, or even gets the concept of a map...
Maybe they don't? I dunno...
Getting directions here in Africa sucks; I can't use maps, and what's worse is that I have to be very, *very* careful about the way that I word questions, because if I pitch a "yes or no" question the answer will always - *always* - be in the affirmative.
An example: *I point,* “Is the border this way?”
“Yes”.
*I point the other way* "Or is it *this* way"
"Yes! Yes!"
It doesn’t matter a lick where I point. Instead, I have to ask a non-binary question: “*Which* way is it to the border?”
If they answer "yes!", that's a dead giveaway that you're asking the wrong person...
I wish someone had told me this a long time ago; would have saved me a fuck-tonne of time running around on wild goose chases...
*I digress...*
I decide to go with the locals on this one. The alternative would be to take a fat detour, which I'm really not keen on; plus, why would they build a 100 kilometre road to nowhere?
Right??
I take off down the single lane road.
*No going back.*
---
The road quickly turns from good tarmac into loose gravel and rock.
It’s actually brilliant. Tarmac, *especially* the good stuff, is a bit soulless. It’s easy, sure, but it lacks *character.* Dirt roads are always changing, never the same, always engaging, always *interesting.*
*Fun.* I feel like I'm *really* riding. 
And this one looks like being a ripper; it's just good enough that I can take my eyes off the track for long enough to enjoy the surrounds, without the fear of hitting something I'd wish I hadn't... It's just true enough that I can take one of my hands off the bars to wave to someone passing by and not die for it.
All of that, and yet it's just rough enough that I can't just mindlessly open the throttle without ending up in the hedges. 
*The perfect ride.*
The dense rain forest crowds in on the dirt road and canopies overhead, enveloping my whole world in green, shading my path.
There’s hardly a soul out here. No villages to speak of, really.
"Traffic" is the very occasional Chinese-plastic-piece-of-shit motorbike, usually broken down. I try and lend a hand where I can.
There's also the occasional truck, which are a bit of a nightmare; they throw up a huge volume of the talcum-powder-like dust, completely browning out all vision. To get past them I have to put up with a few minutes of being increasingly dust-blasted till I'm right up behind their wheels, copping it, and - when I dare - squeezing down the side between the bouncing truck and the trees.
Hairy moments...
I'm glad there's not too many of them.
---
The morning and some of the afternoon goes.
I'm still miles from the border as I pull into a tiny village called Zimmi. This is where the road ends on my map...
I'll take a break.
I turn off the bike and it goes silent, except for... is that... *Celine Dion??*
*Again??*
I've been hearing Celine a lot. She's popular here. Hugely popular, actually. Go figure. It's like going back in time a few decades.
I've no idea why. It's bizarre.
I spot further up the road a border post.
"Bit early for that, isn't it?"
The actual geographical border line must still be hours of riding away...
I quaff lunch, and go check-out of the country.
It's no dramas.
*Cracking on.*
---
About seven hours after leaving K-enema, I land on the geographical border line in a rough as guts border town named *Bo*. It's not remote anymore. It's *busy.*
It’s late in the day. I’m pretty tuckered out. I'm panicking a little. I don't know if I'm happy to attempt a border crossing this late in the day; I get spooked even doing them in the afternoon.
Suffice to say that I'm feeling a bit of pressure to get this border crossing *perfect.*
There’s another Sierra Leone border post here at Bo, and they want to go through the motions again.
I manage to fob them off; I've done it all already, I'm not doing it again. I talk my way out of it.
Getting back to the bike, the usual crowd has milled around to have a gawk.
While I'm whacking on my helmet, a military guy with a big gun and a hard face that reveals an utter lack of a sense of humour, walks up to me and points at my saddle bags, “What is in here!?" he shouts "I want to see everything. You show me. Now!”
Aagh.
I hate it when this happens.
It’s rare that these guys understand how much they can make this puppet dance: a lot.
Pain in the arse more than anything...
I deflect; shake his hand with big smiles, ask him what his name is? Had a good day? Does he like the bike? Does he have a bike? He does!! That's great! Aren't motorbikes great? I'm really glad you like the bike! That's an awesome gun! Really cool! How far is it to the next village? Is it ok there? Not Dangerous? Are you sure? Great! Hey, Sierra Leone's been great. Such nice people here. Hey, where’s a good place to get food? It’s been a long day, I’ve come from Kenema. Where do you live? Hey, that's great! Anyway, really nice meeting you. Have a nice day!!
Smokebomb! Ka-Pow!
Waves all round.
*I’m actually getting pretty good at this.*
I cross a bridge and I’m onto the Liberian post.
*Here we go.*
The usual swarm of people come rushing up to offer their services as soon as I’ve turned the key. Like flies to shit. I have to wade through that to get to the post.
The building itself is actually pretty decent; bricks and everything.
Immigration are behind a very professional looking sheet of Perspex, which is usually a good sign that they’ve got their shit together.
Thwack. Passport stamped.
*I’m in.*
Too easy.
They point me to where Customs are but that’s not too helpful. For some reason there are *two* lots of Customs and I go to the wrong one, bark up the wrong tree, and then get sent off somewhere else.
In the end, Customs turns out to be three guys in plain clothes chilling out on a verandah behind a desk.
I introduce myself around and hand them the bike’s papers and ask for a Temporary Import Permit (Liberians speak English, so it’s TIPs and not Laissez-Passers here).
*They won't give me one.* No TIP.
A bloke who introduced himself as “Uncle Sam” tells me my bike's registration papers will be fine.
“You're already in Liberia, so you don’t need it. Look, *you’re* in Liberia, *the motorbike* is in Liberia, you don't need to import it. *No embarrassment.*”
That’s BS...
If it were true then that would be awesome - no paying for annoying TIPs - but *I* know that it's not; I know that I need one; I know that if I’m caught without one there’ll be trouble.
I know that it'll come back to bite me in the arse.
I tell "Uncle Sam" as much, but he’s not budging. He just keeps saying *“no embarrassment”*.
I beg him; "I don’t *care* if I don’t need it, I’d like one anyway, *please*."
No.
I insist again.
You don't need one. *No embarrassment.*
*I'll pay!!*
No.
I can't reason with him. I can't pay him.
"No embarrassment, I promise you, no embarrassment."
Fuck!
I try to find someone else who might help me out... In the process I get asked questions about all sorts of other shit I’d rather not talk about; one guy *thoroughly* checks out my immunisation card and says it doesn't have yellow fever...
*Shit!!*
I explain to him that the one marked “typhoid” is a special injection - "multiple, big injection!" - that covers everything.
What a load of shit.
He gives me a sort of look, and then just waves me off. I can’t believe I'm still getting away with this... I resolve to forge a yellow fever vaccination in that book the next chance I have...
(To be clear, I've had the injection, it's just not written down anywhere... Yeah, I'm not fucking *crazy*)
In the end there’s no big Customs boss that I can talk to. I try Uncle Sam out one last time, but he just says “No embarrassment. You tell them to talk to Uncle Sam if you have a problem, ok?”.
Cold comfort.
It’s too late in the day to try anything else; the light is fading in a country that I’m a stranger to.
*Gotta go.*
My plan was to head straight to the capital - *Monrovia* - but the folks at Immigration told me I wouldn’t make it there by sunset. They also advised me that "riding around Monrovia in the dark is a very bad idea..." So I settle on a seaside village named Robertsport, which is just a fraction closer to the border.
I want to get Liberia done like a band-aid, just rip the bloody thing off and have it over and done with.
---
I'm only a stone's throw out of the border post. *Checkpoint.*
Bloody... *shit!*
If this is any indication of the regularity of checkpoints in this country then I'm fucked; there's absolutely no way I'll get through without the right paperwork...
Even if I do make it, I'm not going to handle shitting my pants at *every, single, checkpoint*.
If Uncle Sam was in front of me I'd fuckin throttle him.
They make me stop; the road is barred with a rope. And armed guards.
I head to a building off to the side of the road. It's oddly busy for a checkpoint.
I’m *shitting* it.
Please, *please* just go for the passport. *Just the passport.* I don’t have the time or energy to argue...
“Papers”.
I give the guy my passport and nothing else. He writes down my details in a ledger book and tells me I can go.
Thank *fuck.*
I tear out of there.
Launching down some very decent tarmac at a fair clip.
Nothing to see but palm plantations.
No villages, people. No green. Just row upon row upon perfect row of stunted palm trees.
It's getting darker by the minute...
---
At the turnoff for Robertsport the tarmac changes to red dirt road.
I’ve still got fifty fucking clicks to cover.
It's getting *late*. I do *not* want to be out after dark here...
I hammer it.
I know I’m going way too fast; too fast for my skill level, the road conditions, my brain's current fuzziness, that darkness... I know I'm asking for trouble.
I flog it anyway.
I want this day finished...
*Blink.*
I hit something.
I go flying off the road.
I shit my pants, smash over some shrubs.
Get control.
Lurch back onto the red stuff.
I swear words. All the words.
My heart is *smashing.*
I keep the hammer down; it's worth the risk. I *must* beat the light.
---
Nine hours, door to door.
I pull into Robertsport.
*Twilight.*
I'm fucked seven ways to Sunday; nothing works anymore.
I check into the first guesthouse I see and collapse into a foam mattress, surrounded in the light of a dim bulb being powered by a little, loud diesel generator.
I take a moment to reflect. *I’m in Liberia...*
Li-fuckin-beria; somewhere near the top of my "holy shit" list.
On a motorbike. *How the hell did this happen?*

## Chapter Ten
Robertsport is beautiful.
It's an echo of Freetown - half perched on the hillside of a peninsula.
Beautiful ocean on one side, a sort of wetlandish expanse on the other.
I'm staying here today. *I need a break.*
Heading into the guts of the village to grab some breakfast, I notice that the building-material-of-choice has changed; from mud huts and thatched roofs to corrugated iron *everything*.
It must’ve seemed like a good idea at the time...
None of it has stood up to time itself thought...
The whole village has a rusted, derelict, seen-better-days feel to it. 
Something that hasn’t changed is the love of Celine Dion... Honestly, just, *what??*
I listen to "My Heart Will Go On" while I get down a big breakfast of rice, beans and fish.
Time. To. Wander...
---
I accidentally run into the local fish market, down by the banks of the wetlands. Everyone is firing up huge smoking vats made out of, you guessed it, corrugated iron, in preparation for the fishing boats coming back.
While they wait some are working, some are chilling and some are dancing to the usual Africa pop music garbage that’s starting to drive me insane. So terrible and catchy all at once. It’s the same three or four songs, everywhere I go, all the time (except for Celine, of course).
It's *maddening.*
Anyway, one of the young dancers has baby strapped to her back, like, a baby-baby. Tiny little thing. The mum's dancing like a maniac. The baby's head is lolling and rolling around all over the place. It's fast asleep. Either that or it’s dead... Bloody hell. I want to step in and say something, because the mum can’t see what’s happening, what, with the kid *behind* her and all... But how is that my place? No one else seems to mind, or think that it's weird...
It’s something that I have noticed before, that they aren’t particularly precious about their infant kids in this part of the world; they just strap them onto their backs and life goes on as usual. And the kids; you never hear a peep from them, let alone crying. They just sit there in their little makeshift sling, like little baby koalas, head poking out one end and their tiny little feet poking out at the mum’s sides, eyes wide open, happy to watch the world go by. Like contented tiny yogis.
Something to learn there, I think... Yet would I do the same if I had kids? *Fuck no.*
*Anyway,* the fishing boats are coming in; big colourful wooden pirogues, they fly massive flags of all different designs. The fishermen’s clothes are hanging out to dry on lines strung up to the flag pole.
It’s like a Liberian mardi gras, and these are the floats, powered along by tiny little outboard motors.
Word around the traps is that it was a pretty average day for fishing. Could've fooled me; there’s a *shitload* of fish being offloaded.
The younger fishermen are still bubbly enough after their morning's work to have a chat.
There's a deal though; they'll have a chat, but only if I take their photo doing gangster poses in front of the boat...
I'll make that deal.
One of the fishermen is telling me about the work, and I’m following him, but then he suddenly switches to Creole, and I'm completely lost.
The official language in Liberia *is* English, but amongst themselves they - like the Sierra Leoneans - speak a “Creole”. Creole is its own language, but it could probably be better thought of like a dialect of English; kind of like English words with a lot of slang phrasing and words thrown in. I can *hear* the words, but I can never make any meaning out of it. Kind of like talking to a Jamaican, but impossible.
I apologise to the fisherman, and tell him I don't understand Creole *yet.*
He gives me a blank look.
"I was speaking English..."
"You didn't change to Creole halfway??"
"No..."
Fuck! More offence.
I apologise profusely.
How embarrassing.
Fuck me I could do with some subtitles...
I extricate myself as subtly as possible, and make a beeline to the beach at the tip of the peninsula to watch the day go by.

## Chapter Eleven
Monrovia.
Fucking, *Monrovia.*
As I hit the edge of the city's sprawl my head’s churning up with all of the “what if’s” of how this could all go very wrong.
The ride in has been fine; good tarmac, nothing but palm plantations as far as the eye can see. In each village on the way here there were young women walking around topless, completely covered in white paint.
Yeah, so there’s *that*...
Anyway. In a twinkling, Monrovia goes from empty to fuckin *gridlock.*
It's midday; bright, hot and sunny.
I can’t believe they have traffic lights... And they *work*! I can't remember the last time I saw traffic lights...
I'm sitting on a red, admiring the lights when someone blows a fucking whistle right in my ear.
“Papers!!”
Fuck a duck! I nearly jumped off the bike... Scared the absolute *shit* out of me.
It's a cop...
Where the hell did he sneak up from??
And why is he asking me for papers? These are traffic lights, not *checkpoints!*
Alright, douchebag. You want my papers? You got them. But you’re getting them right here, *and I ain’t moving.*
I hand him my UK registration papers. He looks them over and he’s obviously a bit confused, and none too happy.
*These are not the papers he was expecting.*
The lights go green.
Pure vitriol pours out of every car stuck behind me.
*The noise!*
The blaring cacophony is exactly what I was hoping for and... result! he hands me back my rego and tersely waves me on!
*Victory!*
I head in deeper and deeper into the city, till I find what feels like the guts of the town.
Time to find somewhere to shack up.
There's not a shitload of options jumping out at me...
A dingy looking motel is the only obvious thing... I park up and ask the lads milled around out front if they could watch my bike for a tick.
Stepping into the motel, my eyes won't adjust to the darkness... I shuffle in, blind, till I can make out someone's outline.
No, it's a group...
*Fuck it's dark in here...*
"Hi..." I shake hands with the outlines. "Do you have any rooms available?"
"What?"
"Do you have a room for the night?"
"How many hours?"
"Hours? Uh, no, not hours. The night."
"What time will you come?"
"What time will I come?? I'm here now. *Now?*"
"Mmmmmmm, I don't know this..."
*What the fuck's going on here??* Are these guys thick in the head?
"I don't understand - You don't know how much a room costs for a night?"
"No, only hours."
"Well... Ok: What would it cost me, if I came here now - right now - and then left, tomorrow? And can I see a room?"
They take me off towards the rooms while they do the math; 24 times the hourly rate...
It's too much. I punch them down to 1000 Liberian dollars - about fifteen bucks.
I see the room... It looks *seedy.*
"Can I keep my motorbike inside?"
"You can keep it out on the street, it will be safe"
I can’t help but laugh.
Fuck that. I'm worried about it out there right now, in broad daylight...
"Nah I need it inside, do you have space?"
"No, no, outside is safe. No embarrassment."
"What's with this 'no embarrassment'?.. I can't have it inside? Anywhere?"
"Mmmmmmm no. There is nowhere."
That's a deal breaker.
The shadowy outlines have become three young blokes. I shake their hands. "Ok, thanks anyway."
On the way out I walk past a front room that I didn't even see on the way in. I get a flash of a glimpse inside as I reach for the door.
Empty, except for a handful of women, there are shiny sequins, they're sitting, facing my direction, saying nothing.
I open the door to the blinding light of the outside and step through.
Wait... Is this a fucking *brothel???*
"Cheeses fucking *Christ.*"
I squint, put on my sunglasses. The bike's still there.
*I need a shower.*
Fuck me... Imagine if they had've let me have the bike inside, I would have said yes...
Ugh...
I thank the guys out the front for watching the bike. One of them gives me a knowing wink.
*Get me the fuck out of here.*
---
Second place, the same question: *how many hours.*
The place after that, *the same again.*
*Yuck.*
I ride around in the hot, chaotic traffic for an hour or so. Looking.
I find the perfect place.
A clean yet pretty spartan hotel. They even have a security guard out front.
The cheapest room they have is 120.
Not Liberian dollars... *U.S.* dollars.
Deal breaker.
I start to get panicky. I can feel it; things aren't looking good.
*I'm over it.*
I find the least brothelly brothel; they charge both by the hour *and* by the night.
*Classy.*
$20 for an overnighter, $5 for a "short stay".
The roll of condoms on your pillow is included in the price.
I'm assuming that this place is less of a brothel and more of a "place you fuck your mistress" type thing.
Or, this is where you bring the hooker picked up on the street... In any case, there are no women here, *yet...*
I don't want to think about it.
They'll let me keep the bike in one of their spare rooms inside.
I haggle 25% off the price and take it. So long as the bike is safe, it'll be ok.
It's not forever.
---
My room is an absolute shocker.
Grim.
Concrete everything, dimly lit by a single bulb that plugs into an electrical socket near the floor by the door, so the room is lit up from below.
Everything casts a shadow.
There’s no window, but rather a tiny grate in the wall that makes me feel like I’m in jail.
Jail would probably be cleaner...
The mattress is thick - double the thickness of a normal mattress - and made of weak, yellowing foam. When I lie in it it engulfs me. Completely. Like I'm *in* it, not on it..
Like I'm drowning. Claustrophobic.
The pillows are questionable.
They smell...
I don't want to think too much about any of it.
The bathroom is its own separate room. There's no door, just a human sized hole in the concrete. It catches none of the light from the globe on the floor.
It's dark and wet. It feels like there are things growing in here...
There is a toilet with no seat, and no flush, and a big barrel of water with a bucket floating around in it.
A small hole in the concrete floor is the drain.
I can smell that cockroaches are close-by (a skill I've learned on the journey). But I can’t see them. It's too dark.
Back to the bedroom, it's secured from the hall with a flimsy wooden door with a tiny latch, smaller than my thumb, and a tiny padlock to go it with.
The latch is held in place by a couple of wood nails.
It is - *by far* - the worst value place I’ve ever made myself stay in.
I leave.
---
First things first: *Cash.*
Liberia has two currencies: The Liberian dollar and the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is actually an official currency here, and you can get them out at cash machines.
This is an exciting development for me, and a great chance to pick up some “break-in-case-of-emergency” currency; my first easy shot at doing this since I got cleaned out in Dakar...
The first ATM I try makes that delightful crunching sound as it counts the notes, and spits out a thousand dollars’ worth of the crispiest, freshest U.S. dollars you’ve ever seen.
Fuck I love it when things *just work.*
I pocket the wad in a hurry and scurry back to my den, wary of anyone who looks at me twice.
Juicy safety net: Tick.
Time. To. Wander.
---
I head to the markets for the obligatory look at “a day in the life of a Monrovian”. The market on the riverside is par-for-the-course; in just the same vein as all the other places I’ve been. But the difference here is in the *density* of it. Markets are normally packed and bustling, but this is just crazy. It’s like being in a hot, sweaty mosh pit. Half the market is roofed, in a sprawling duck-your-head shantytown. It's dim, stifling, and not too inviting. The other half is open to the blazing sunshine, and the sellers and traders do their thing from under the shade of huge umbrellas. From a distance it looks like a jam packed day at the beach.
I’m much too late for lunch and finding chop is a struggle; all the big mammas are gone.
After a long time looking I finally find someone selling some food. Both the big mamma and the food look pretty damn questionable... She’s missing a lot of teeth, but I’m more worried about the food; looks like shit... I won’t be the only one sitting on the bench though, as there are five young girls all chowing down on the same bowl of rice, cassava leaves, and the most mysterious of mystery meats. It's a brown curry sort of thing that’s clearly gone horribly wrong. Amongst all the solid stuff I can’t see anything resembling something I would call “meat”.
So, it's either this, or go hungry...
*Beggars can’t be choosers.*
I grab a bowl and chow down the grisly brown stuff.
There's so much gristle to chew through that my jaw hurts. I have a sneaking suspicious that everything I'm seagulling down the hatch won't be staying there for long... I ask the big mamma how much it costs to rent the food instead of buying it. She misses the joke, thank god.
Once I’m done committing hara-kiri, I swap sweat with a thousand strangers to get back out of the market and into the city.
*I'm wet.*
Fuckin *rank.*
I dry out a bit as I walk around town, and it *is* a proper city; it's got business towers, high-rise buildings and everything. The odd thing about it though is that half of it is completely derelict. Abandoned.
I can tell that once-upon-a-time this place must've been doing pretty well; I can see the extent of foreign investment in the multitude of old and washed up buildings with foreign words on them - all untouched in years - abandoned when the foreigners all got the fuck out of here at the outbreak of war.
No one came back, it seems.
It’s an eerily fascinating walk.
I come across an absolute doozy. A big, ten story, beige coloured tower. It looks like it was abandoned in the finishing stages of construction. All of the windows are missing, it looks dishevelled, with weird black pockmarks covering it all over. The whole tower's surrounded by barbed wire.
I get to talking with a nearby security guard and ask what the building is. Apparently, the Chinese were nearly done building it as a bank, and then dropped it like it’s hot when things got messy. 
"Ah, ok. What are all those weird marks?"
"Bullets."
"Bullets!? As in bullet *holes*??"
"Yes, these are where people shoot the building."
"Shit... All of them?"
"Yes, all bullets."
They're *everywhere*
The whole ex-war-zone thing just got *very* real.
A local bloke - who seems friendly enough - overhears our conversation and tells me he’ll take me in and show me around.
"O-kaay..."
We bypass the barbed wire and walk into the building. It's been overtaken by squatters. Nothing but bare concrete walls and pillars and people. I get a fair few confused looks, which is probably fair enough.
There are bullet holes in here too...
We walk a few floors, and then I want to get out. I don't feel at ease in here... There's something about those looks...
I thank my guide and head out, back to the streets and open sunshine.
---
I'm seeing bullet holes everywhere I look now.
They're *everywhere.*
I wonder how hard it would be for the locals to simply fill them in, but they’ve obviously got more important things to do, which I guess is fair enough, but leaving them there for *decades*?
It's weird; if it were me I'd paste them over just to stop being reminded of the war. Right?
I walk the streets for a few hundred meters till I get to the coast.
I can’t believe my eyes.
Beautiful clean sand, blue water, and a beautiful surf break where the big swell is pumping up massive waves.
I realise that my mouth is open...
"Where the fuck...?"
It's reeking hot, and a mere stone's throw away people are climbing over each other for space, yet there's hardly a soul on the sand.
*Am I missing something here?*
I feel like I've crossed into some alternate universe.
Or, the same universe, but back in time.
I walk the beach, looking for anyone who might be renting a surfboard.
I walk a few clicks down the beach till I hit a river barring my route; a *river* of absolute filth. Sludge and excrement from who-knows-where. It's *thick*. Oozing its way out into the sea. I can actually *see* human shit in it. Revolting.
Fucking *ruined*.
I stop looking for a surfboard.
---
I get back to the market quarter as the light's getting a bit dim. 
Bullet holes or no bullet holes, I can’t believe how safe and relaxed I’ve felt walking the city streets.
Sure, I’m paying attention to what’s been going on - to not do that would be thick - but, by and large, I've been happily walking about, and no one’s been giving me the slightest bit of grief.
No harassing, nothing threatening, just quite a bit of staring. That’s all.
That said, I’ve been told by a number of people not to be out after dark... I’m not about to tempt fate and loiter about as the sun sets.
That means quick chow and then double-time it back to the demi-brothel.
Rush home before the zombies come out.
Seafood is on the menu tonight. I manage to get a whole fish off one of the big mammas for 160 Liberian dollars, which is about $2.50.
The Liberian bank notes are so filthy and worn that it’s hard to distinguish the amounts; it's just dirty, old paper. And wet; they have a wet dampness to them. Moist. It’s disgusting.
But it's legal tender, and it'll get me a whole fish.
I make like a local and eat it my hands, and it’s pretty good.
I double-time it back to the hovel as the light fades.

## Chapter Twelve
Delirium.
Sweat.
Boiling fever.
Half-waking, half-sleeping, restless.
Raving.
Demented.
Swallowed by the bed. Lying in my own sweat. Burning up.
*Trapped.*
---
Sunrise. At last.
Deliverance.
I've been wishing for it all night.
I've never felt worse.
The first rays of sunlight through my prison grating are greeted by an urgent need to use the facilities.
I crap like a tap.
Fucking *great*.
So. I’m sick. Again. In this shithole.
Sick, but not really surprised; was it mystery meat lunch? Or the "lets touch the most filthy currency in the world and then eat some fish with same hands" dinner.
Probably both.
---
It takes hours to clear the decks... Sitting, slumped, in that dark horror of a bathroom.
I get the feeling it might be safe enough to venture out. I feel like shit, but so what? I just want to get my visas and get going.
I head out boldly, armed and ready for the embassies. Every ounce of my consciousness focused inwards, watching like a hawk for signs of potential disaster. A zen monk ain't got shit on my level of inner watchfulness.
Monrovia is a ghost town.
There *was* a zombie apocalypse...
*Have I missed something again?* Yesterday, there was no such thing as “personal space”, today I'm alone. Eerily so.
When I finally do find someone on the street - alive - I find out that today is the national day for honouring the dead.
*“Declaration Day”*.
No work, no markets, no nothing.
Well, so much for getting visas...
Even though I'm crook, I know that I have to eat something. The only thing I can find after half an hour of looking around is a couple of doughnuts and a banana. Breakfast of champions.
I’ve got nothing better to do than to check out the embassies - I don't want to spend the day in the demi-brothel if I can help it.
After a few hours of taxi’s and bad directions I find the embassies for both Ivory Coast and Ghana. Both shut. G-R-E-A-T.
It's weird, I always thought that Ivory Coast was a name for, y'know, a coast, not a country...
---
In the afternoon I start burping massive, long burps. They taste like omelettes...
*Omelettes!*
I haven’t eaten an omelette or anything eggy in a long time. A *really* long time. That’s probably not good.
Over the course of the day the omelette graduates into that familiar, citrus-y taste from Senegal. 
*Tangy.*
Fucking *great.*
I know the drill...
I head to my brothel abode and wait.
My stomach is bloated and distended out far enough that I’m sure I must look like an albino Biafran.
Finally the nausea comes and I’ve learnt my lesson from the past; *resistance is futile.*
Everything comes out looking like it did when it went in.
I need to chew more.
*Bloody hell.*
It’s like my stomach doesn’t do digestion anymore, it just temporary stores food and water.
Lovely.
I brush my teeth to get that taste out of my mouth and - I swear to god - the toothpaste isn’t real toothpaste. The packaging looks legit; it says *Colgate*. But this ain’t toothpaste.
Fails all round.
---
Throughout the night I’m most often sitting. Sometimes kneeling. Seldom lying. Always close to *the can.*
When I do get the chance to rest it’s that same fucking bitch of a delirious sleep as last night, which I reckon is worse than being awake.
Fuck this is miserable.
---
The sun finally rises and there’s a little leprechaun swinging a hammer in my brain in time with my heartbeat.
Donk.. Donk.. Donk..
I’ve gotta remember, no one’s making me do this...
It’s hard to indulge in self-pity when there's no one else to blame.
Visas.
Yes.
Today’s the day.
---
I retrace my tracks from yesterday and, thank god, the Ivory Coast / Cote d’Ivoire embassy or consulate or whatever is open. Huzzah.
I *need* this visa; if they won't let me into Cote d'Ivoire, I can't really leave Liberia. At least not in that direction...
I fill out the forms, have a chat with the ambassador or consular or whoever he is.
I walk out half an hour later with a three month visa stuck in my passport. $70 and no hassle. Easiest visa I've ever picked up.
Next go is the “Hail Mary” chuck at the problem child; Ghana.
I’m ready for the “no, no, no - you have to be a resident” shit and I don’t care; Cote d’Ivoire will do for now and I can kick the Ghana can a little ways down the road.
I get through some pretty locked down security just to get into the Ghana embassy compound, and head into a room that feels like a doctor’s waiting room. Behind a sheet of thick perspex is a man at a desk. Does Ghana have a lot of enemies? Must do. Anyway. I ask about a visa.
"Are you a resident of Liberia?"
Here we go again...
"No."
"Do you have an entrance stamp in your passport for Liberia?"
"Uh, yes... Of course..."
"Ok. That will do."
Oh. *Shit yeah.* Jackpot baby!
He wants *four* photocopies of practically every piece of paper that I own, two references from two Ghanaian citizens and a “mission statement” from me; explaining what my purpose is and why I should be granted a visa.
I think I can manage that.
---
Four hours later and I’ve got all that paperwork. I’ve fabricated a couple of references from out of a guidebook for Ghana, complete with names, phone numbers and addresses. For the "mission statement" I’ve written up the whole “I’m riding a bike through Africa” thing, and greased on that I'm really looking forward to the Ghanaian culture.
It works.
70 dollars later and I’m the stoked owner of a 90 day Ghanain visa.
You fuckin ripper!
I spend whats left of the afternoon, doing "life admin".
Turns out JB broke something on his bike on the way out of Freetown and had to double back to get it repaired, so I'm actually well ahead of him now. Which is good; he's a much better chance to catch up to me before Nigeria than me catching up with him.

## Chapter Thirteen
I’m done with Monrovia.
So done.
Another night spent on *the can* in that fucking filthy cave of a bathroom in this shitpile of a demi-brothel.
I dare not eat anything substantial. Biscuits and bananas are about all I can stomach.
As if I didn't look shit enough already, all of my burnt skin from 'River No.2 Beach' has decided it’s going to flake off, so now my whole body and face look poxy.
Lovely.
Being crook is exhausting, and the lack of food, energy and sleep is starting to show.
I don’t really care. I just want to get out of here.
I head out for breakfast. It's another public holiday... I don’t know what for and I don’t particularly give a shit; all this means to me is that there won’t be any breakfast this morning.
And that’s not good.
I feel totally spent and the day hasn’t even started yet. I drag my feet when I walk. I'm all stooped over and old looking.
I really don't want to, but I reckon it’s probably a good idea to stay for one more night. If there’s no food in Monrovia, then what chance do I have of getting lunch on the road? And what if the next stop, *Buchannan*, is all closed up too? What about accommodation? What about petrol? Will the petrol stations be open on a public holiday?
Who cares.
*I just can't do it anymore.*
I’ve got to get out of here. I don’t care if I have a shit day of it, I want out. I refuse to spend another night in this shithole.
Loading the bike takes everything I have left.
I ride out.
So long, Monrovia, you’ve been bloody awful.
---
The city is covered in an eerie, dense fog. It’s morning, but not that early, and regardless of the time, this is the first I’ve ever seen fog in Africa.
Ominous.
I’m no weatherman, but what I’m taking from it is that fog + time = rain, and rain + dirt roads = mud, and mud does not equal fun. In fact, just plain old rain does not equal fun on a motorbike; not to mention that my saddlebags are so beaten up they’d be about as waterproof as a sieve.
I sit at a set of traffic lights, still technically inside Monrovia. I muse over the chance of a wet-season coming soon.
Two policemen pop up out of nowhere, right in my fucking face.
“Papers, *now*!!”
I jump in my seat.
They’re in *full* riot gear.
All in black.
They look like an African SWAT team.
Shields, armoured body gear, the whole nine yards.
They’ve come from a police post at the side of road that I didn’t spot coming into the red light. There's a handful of hardcore cops milling about over there, watching.
I leave the bike running and hand them my UK rego papers; it's all I've got.
They’re as confused about these as everyone else is when I hand them over; no one seems to ever be sure what exactly they’re looking at. But it looks *very* official...
“Where is your permit?”
My mate Uncle Sam has fucked me.
The lights go green. And all the cars backed up behind me go fucking berserk. Beautiful.
“This is my permit. See?”
“No. You are under arrest.”
Bam! The other cop - the short one - grabs my keys out of the ignition, killing the bike, and shoves them in his pocket in one swift movement.
“Oi! Hey! Give those back!”
“No! You are under arrest!”
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
“No... No I’m not. I’m not under arrest. Why do you think I’m under arrest? What for?”
“You have no permit, you are under arrest!”
This short one seems to be a little dim...
"Bring the bike over here", the tall one gestures at the side of the road. The cars behind me are going apeshit; they’ve missed the green light...
What choice do I have? Gotta do it.
Leverage lost, I try the usual arguments that the registration is fine, I don’t need a permit. I’m allowed to be here. “You go and ask Uncle Sam, the boss-man at the border, *big* boss-man, you ask him, the boss-man, he says 'No embarrassment', you ask!”
That throws them...
The short one, a little baffled, picks up his go-to line “You are under arrest! Yes, embarrassment!”
I’m too tired; my thick brain can't come up with anything clever...
A small, plain clothed man comes up to me from out of a growing crowd on the sidewalk, and starts telling *me* what the problem is.
*Who the fuck is this guy??*
According to him, it's not a problem that I don't have a temporary import permit for the bike. No. *The problem* is that motorbikes aren't allowed on this road without a *special* permit.
*What?!*
“Who are you??” I ask him. I'm totally out of patience. “Are you the police?? Huh??”
To that he whips out an ID card.
I lean in and squint. I’m talking to... *Colonel Williams* of Liberian fucking Immigration.
*What???*
Am I supposed to fucking believe that? That a *Colonel* just happened to be passing by? On foot?
I smell a rat.
The fattest of rats.
This is a stitch up. It’s gotta be...
But the ID, well, it *does* look legit...
I take him on face value, "I don't get it. It's a road. I shouldn't need a permit."
"Do you see any other motorbikes on this road? Eh? No. And look," the Colonel points to the corner of the intersection "you see all those scooter taxis, they wait there, off the main road, because they don't have a permit"
There's a handful of scooters with riders just sitting on them, doing nothing, going nowhere on the corner of the main drag...
While I look at that, the riot police have pulled over some other poor bastard on two wheels.
He looks *terrified.*
He frantically pulls out from under his shirt a laminated A4 sheet of paper that is roped around his neck.
I’m not making it up; it's an enormous permit, laminated, hung from around his neck, stuffed down his shirt.
I take a closer look.
It looks legit. Some sort of permission granted for using a scooter or motorcycle on the main road. Stamps and everything.
I scan my memory for motorbikes I’ve seen on this street in Monrovia. Not a single one comes to mind. And it's Africa, they should be everywhere...
"You are under arrest!!"
Fuck. That might be right...
No one ever told me about this. How the fuck was I supposed to know?
Ugh.
I’m so *tired.*
“Can I have my keys back?”
“You are under arrest!”
It’s time to change tack, and fast.
“Hey guys, ummm, do you know how I can get to Buchannan? Which way is it, you know, without using the wrong roads? Is it down this way?”
It’s a dumb thing to ask and completely off topic.
*Everyone* wants to help me with directions. They all start talking over each other, finishing each other’s sentences to explain it to me. I’m getting advice from tall cop, short cop and my mate the Colonel. Even passer-by’s are throwing in their two cents. They're giving me directions on how to get *all the way* to Buchannan, like, 150 clicks worth of directions.
*This is going to work.*
I mirror back to them their own directions, and everyone’s all smiles and nodding and thumbs up.
“Great, thank you so much guys, I really appreciate it. Can I grab my keys?”
Short n dim actually gives me my keys back! This is going to work! What a gambit!!
“Thanks again!”
I fire up the bike and it roars to life. I can *see* the moment it snaps everybody out of their well-wishing hypnosis they were under.
“You are under arrest!!”
Arrrrghh, *fuck*!!
So friggin close!
“Come on man, I’m just a simple traveller, how am I supposed to know about this, it was an honest mistake. Just let me off this time. Give me a break.”
I look pleadingly to my mate the Colonel, who I’ve decided is on my team, but even he seems to be out of his league, or at least out of his jurisdiction: This is a police matter, and the Colonel of Immigration doesn't hold court here, it seems.
He shrugs his shoulders and wishes me good luck and off he goes, walking back into the mob that's formed; the one guy in my corner and I’ve lost him.
The riot cops tell me to go and park over on the other side of the road next to their checkpoint, where the rest of the hard looking cops are.
I’m so hungry.
I wonder if I threw up all over everyone if they’d let me leave, or if that would make things worse.
Or maybe I could crap my pants.
I reckon I could do either of the two, on cue. *Right now.*
They’d *definitely* let me go if I squirted brown everywhere. *Pronto.*
"We are taking the bags, and the bike. You are going to prison. You are under arrest." Tall cop says it, with solemn finality.
Nothing happens. I just sit and on the bike and wait.
Hunger and exhaustion start to turn the vice.
The mob have crossed the road to continue to gawk, like this is some sort of spectator sport.
The riot cops tell them to move on, but they refuse, shouting at the cops, who are shouting back.
The cops start shoving people. The people shove back.
Batons are brandished, the shouting ratchets.
What the *fuck* is going on??
I’m shitting it. I need to get the fuck out of here...
The mob scuffles with the cops.
Everyone's *screaming.*
One of the cop cracks a bloke on the arm with a baton, and the mob scatters; fucking bolts for it as the cops chase them off.
I’m at the end of my tether.
Either they'll put me in prison, or they want a monster bribe.
What would I pay to get out of here? The sky’s the limit.
I'll pay all I've got, and I've got all that money that I took out just a few days ago. An even thousand. I'd give it all just to leave.
How do I even start that conversation? I haven’t the slightest idea and my brain isn't fucking working right.
I’ve never done this shit before.
What worries me the most about suggesting a bribe is that it could be used as further leverage against me, digging me deeper into the hole. I don't want another charge on the rap sheet...
I decide to do nothing; it seems the least worst option.
I'm actually pretty proud of myself for my outer composure; despite being ready to meltdown on the inside, on the outside I must look bored.
I really hope I do.
---
I've been at the lights for maybe half an hour now, all up. I haven't gotten off the bike once, for fear that they'll take it off me.
A new cop comes up to me, one I haven’t talked to before, a young man, but from the looks of him he might be the one in charge here...
“You’re under arrest.”
I shake his hand.
"Ugh."
I wait for him to go on.
“You are under arrest, yes? We are taking your everything, yes? And you are going to go to a Liberian prison for six months, yes? Liberia prisons are not a nice place. Very bad. Yes?”
I think he's finished...
“Six months is a long time for a minor traffic offence don’t you reckon?”
“Yes” he nods his head, solemnly, “a very long time. Yes. *Or*, you can pay a fine now.”
And *there* it is.
“Ok. What’s the fine?”
“Yes...” he thinks about it.
*This is it.*
“Fifty! Fifty *American*, dollars!”
I keep my hysteria in check. *Just...*
I want to laugh and cry and slap this dickhead in the face. All at once.
All this - all of this tension and pant-shitting terror and freak out and dread and anxiety - all of it, for fifty measly bucks.
I almost feel short changed... I raise my eyebrows.
“Whoa! Fifty!? That's a lot!!" I shake my hands like they're hot. "I have a twenty? I have it here, now.”
He thinks about it. “Yes. Ok.”
*Unbelievable.*
My first bare-faced bribe in Africa.
I dig into my secret money pocket inside my leather jacket - very careful not to reveal too much - and dig a twenty dollar note out of a wad of a thousand.
He tells me not to pay the fine here, but around the corner in the next street, out of sight of the checkpoint.
*Dodgy.*
"You let me on the bike and we go together."
“Nah mate. You can walk.”
I follow him for a while and then go ahead to park the bike out of the line of sight of the checkpoint.
I stop the bike and I'm immediately boxed in tightly by three scooters.
"Oi! What the..!?"
One has blocked my path in front, another blocked my path behind, and a third pulls up alongside me, pinning me to the gutter. The dickhead cop is sitting on the back. 
All of them are grinning at me.
*Mugs.*
They must've thought I was trying to make a getaway...
*Unnecessary.*
I give the cop the twenty bucks, and his scooter rider guns it down the street, tearing away from the police checkpoint. The prick on the back is laughing.
Joke's on you, ya spud.
I go to leave in the hole they've made to my right, but the guy on the scooter in front of me moves his scooter back to block my path. *Grinning.*
I'm going to use my last ounce of strength to deck him...
I rock back, change direction, and ride off.
Even though I know it's over I feel like I'm fleeing the scene.
---
The damage was nothing. In truth, it's a victory if ever there was one, but it’s left me feeling frazzled and vulnerable.
Unsafe.
I hate being at the whim of these bastards. *Hate* it. It makes me feel like a hunted animal, makes me edgy. Tense.
After flying through the busy streets - spending more time than is safe with my eyes on my mirrors, looking for a chaser - I finally start breathing normally again, and decide to take a break.
I’m starving.
I pull over where I see a lady selling the biggest bananas on the planet.
*That’ll do.*
The bananas are as big as my forearm. *Huge.* A banana as big as a baguette.
The lady seems a little perplexed when I ask for one; like it's an odd request, but she sells it to me anyway.
As we're changing money she just starts *screaming.*
I follow her gaze, and see a pickup truck reversing down a steep hill and over the top of my bike.
I scream.
The metal of the pickup is *shrieking* over the top of my bike.
"*Stop! Stop!!*" I run.
The driver stops the car, the bike is *way* underneath the tray.
He pauses there, unsure what to do.
"*GET OFF!! GET THE FUCK OFF!!!*"
This is it. It’s all over. He’s just fucked my bike.
He puts the pickup into first gear, fucks up the hill start and rolls back further, screeching over my bike.
I scream again.
I can do nothing.
The pickup finally moves forward to more screeching of metal on metal.
My bike...
It’s all too much. I'm making noisy breaths.
*I want to go home.*
The bike is still, somehow, on its wheels, but pushed way over to one side, warping the kickstand. On the side that took the contact the metal crashbar has been bent all the way back so that it’s pinned against the side of the bike and the exhaust. The tank has a ding in the bottom of it, *inches* from the motor.
It's taken off paint.
I keep looking.
*"Is that it??"*
That’s it.
The driver has jumped out of the pickup and is absolutely shitting it. I would be too; I'm fucking *furious*. He's apologising profusely. I can’t even really hear him; I’m too busy swearing. Not at him. Just at everything. I don’t even know what I’m really saying anymore. Just randomly walking about, nonsensically but profusely venting my spleen.
It feels better.
This morning has been more than I can deal with.
The exhaustion's in my bones now.
*All I wanted was a banana.* Is that too much to ask?
I give the kickstand and the crashbar a good kicking to re-align them a little, and go back and get my banana off the screaming lady.
I peel it, and the thin outer layer of the peel comes ripping off like sticky tape, leaving all the bulk of the peel behind.
*Under-fucking-ripe.*
I’m gonna cry.
I rip the whole thing apart with my hands and nails like an angry monkey might. Finally, banana.
I try to take a bite but it’s impossible, it’s so tough and hard that I can’t even gnaw off a piece with my back teeth like a rat.
I hate this banana.
The screaming has brought in another huge mob, and they're all watching me with perplexed looks on their faces.
*I give up.*
I ask it if someone would like my banana. A man steps forward and takes the mangled, half-chewed banana off me.
I’m fucking *off.*
---
The derelict shantytowns become nothing but squat palm plantations.
It's been an hour.
No people. No food.
It’s the hottest, most stifling, most humid day I’ve had on the whole trip. The sun is *brutal*, and there's absolutely zero shade.
Being crook, I was dehydrated before I even started.
It feels like my bodys got nothing left.
I’m riding around using only half a brain; if that.
In the distance, I see a tiny village.
There's a shack. *They're selling food.*
Sandwiches.
I hoover an egg and mayo sandwich, *inhale it.*
It's the second best thing I've ever eaten.
I hope it stays with me...
---
Back on the bike and leaving the village.
Off in the distance I spot a checkpoint. I get a cold dump of adrenaline I didn't ask for.
I can't. I *can't*...
I'm terrified.
I just can't do it again.
Approaching it, I'm looking for a way to get past without stopping.
There’s a roped bunting that’s barring the road, stopping cars, and there are police on the road.
I slow right down and go off the side of the road, down the shoulder and into the dirt in a deeply dug out trench.
I pass under the bunting, and I'm through to the other side.
The shoulder back up to the road is too steep for me to climb, and up ahead the trench comes to a dead end.
*Stuck.*
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
I’ve got no choice; I have to turn around and make my way back to where I came from.
Back past the bunting, back up the shoulder, back onto the road, all under the watchful eyes of the cops, who haven't missed a moment of me trying to dodge them.
Caught red handed.
Once I'm back up on the road, one of the police unhooks the rope and gestures for me to park up the bike on the other side.
I ride slowly, casually past the cop holding the rope, and then gun it.
*Flee.*
Even through my helmet and the roar of the bike I can hear the cops losing their shit behind me, and I can see them wigging out in my mirrors.
I get far enough down the road to know I’m not being chased - and that I can't be shot - and I start breathing again.
It might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever done.
It’s the sort of blatantly retarded thing that could land you in the deepest of shit. *Or worse...*

## Chapter Fourteen
Buchannan.
No more checkpoints. Uneventful, straight tarmac all the way.
I’m starting to really get the shits with the bike; the oil level indicator or “sight glass”, which lets you look into the sump to see the oil level is driving me nuts; I’ll do identical oil level tests on perfectly level road, and one test will show that the oil sump is brimming full, the next will show that it’s bone dry.
I’ve got fuck all idea what the true, correct reading is, and so I don’t know if it’s overfull or if it’s empty or if it’s Goldilocks. And there’s oil hosing out of the motor *all the time*.
I *need* to know how much oil is left. It scares me.
Buchanan's an unremarkable port hole. I'd like to ride further, but I can't.
After shacking up in a shitty hotel (that's *not* a brothel) I go walkabout, and chat to as many people as I can about where I should go next.
*Harper.*
Two hundred clicks straight down the coast.
There are two routes: a straight line, or, a 600km inland detour.
All my maps have the straight road dead-ending at a river...
Sketchy.
And no one can tell me if there are bridges or canoes there to get me to the other side.
The 600km detour is a sure thing; with multiple people confirming it's do-able.
I’m not thrilled about turning a one day trip into a three day fuckabout.
I find a tin shack restaurant and continue my enquiries over lunch, which is mysterious meats in some sort of stew with rice.
Pretty gnarly stuff. Flies everywhere. But it’s popular with the locals so it’s popular with me.
---
Maybe not so popular...
As I lie in bed for a siesta my guts are roiling. They won't let me sleep.
I don't know if it's lunch, or just a Monrovian hangover.
I feel *green* with nausea.
I could easily chuck it all up - anytime I want - and send myself back to square one. But this feels important. I don't think I will manage if I chuck up another day's food; I'll just stop working.
So I hold it down, and give it a chance to ingest *something*.
---
Morning.
I've kept it down so far, but I've got tangy burps, and I don't know how long I can hold out.
My guts are moving in a way that indicates something violent is imminent. And I don’t mean throwing up either...
I get up and look in the mirror.
I look like I should, I guess, which is to say I look like dogshit.
I want to stay another day in Buchannan but, more than that, I still feel an overwhelming urge to *escape*. To run away.
I ignore the warning signs, load up the bike, and roll the dice.
---
My furious gut plus the shaking of the bike start whipping up their perfect storm.
In an act of pragmatism I skip breakfast; I don’t want to give myself any more ammunition.
I leave Buchannan, and take the road for the six hundred kilometre detour.
Tarmac quickly turns into a single-laned, well-graded red dirt track.
---
Gone are the endless rows of plantations, replaced with a sparse, green forest that creeps in on the roadside.
Sometimes the trees canopy over the track to give some shade, sometimes I'm open to the cloudy sky above.
There's the very seldom village, and in each village there are young topless women, painted white.
I hardly notice any of this.
I’m a man on a mission.
Eyes on the prize as I chop down the road, destroying the serenity as I smash around in top gear.
I’m all negativity; flying in a mad rush to get to nowhere in particular.
I’m in such a hurry that the only times I ever stop are when my bowels tell me they won't wait another second. Or I’m stopped at a checkpoint... 
Never trust a fart in Africa... Or the police...
I'm not sure which I dread more.
But both turn out to be non-events; I squatted in the forest and let go of one of my top farts of all time; a spectacular ten second duration which somehow managed to stay dry, to great surprise and delight; and the checkpoint officials being all smiles and handshakes and well wishing.
No problem.
---
After about six hours in my head and two hundred clicks on the clock I find myself in a big enough small village to know I’m a good chance at finding somewhere to eat and sleep. *Saclepea*.
It's a *long* way between viable villages, so I call it a day.
An average speed of 33km/h doesn’t sound like a lot, but with breaks included *and* on a dirt road with a Royal Enfield that’s pretty good going. I’m satisfied with that.
And I didn't shit my pants, or vomit. *Not even once.*
---
*Sweet baby Cheeses*, they have a shower. My own fucking shower.
The shower rose is the size of a dinner plate.
I strip down and jump in immediately.
It feels like I'm caught in a deluge. Like I'm standing under a thundering, cool waterfall.
I could happily drown.
After an unknown amount of time I call it.
I go and lie down on my *real* mattress. With *clean* sheets.
And smile.
I get up and go take another shower.

## Chapter Fifteen
I could leap tall buildings in a single bound.
It’s incredible what a good night’s sleep and a full, settled stomach can do.
And showers; I've taken *five*.
The biggest change is between the ears.
I *can’t wait* to get on the bike.
---
*Green*.
A well graded dirt road.
I've been cruising, taking it easy, enjoying the ride, head in the clouds, soaking it all in.
Outback Liberia is jaw-droppingly *stunning*.
The track is never straight, following the contours of the land. 
The red stuff under the tyres has gone a deeper, rusty red after last night’s rains. The forest has become way, way denser since yesterday.
It's older.
Untouched.
It’s so thick that anything a few meters into the forest is lost to sight; you can only ever see as far as the next corner.
The rain has wetted the leaves, cleaned them up, and made the shades of green that much richer.
There are heavy storm clouds hovering in the sky, threatening to ruin my day. For now though they're content just shading me without pissing on the parade.
Fuck it’s beautiful.
It feels so *old*. Ancient, even. It’s got to be old growth forest; it must have taken hundreds of years for the trees to grow to this size.
I have it all to myself.
Except for the U.N., that is...
Enormous, tank like vehicles, all in white. "U.N." emblazoned in on the sides in black.
This is the shit you normally see on the news...
*Am I not supposed to be here??*
The soldiers are dressed like soldiers, except they're wearing sky blue helmets.
They’ve got big road graders, and trucks, and tractors. All perfect white.
I ride past, and they're disinterested. I actually get a couple of waves.
They're *Pakistani's*?
That's... *weird...*
---
*Checkpoint.*
I fizz a little.
I *hate* this. The confrontation. It makes me feel sick.
Fucking Uncle Sam. That bastard's ruined Liberia for me.
Roped bunting; I won't be able to get under it, or around it.
I try my best to slip around it, but by the time I’ve done that the police have woken up and come running out of their hut to stop me.
I'm not going to bolt this time...
I pull up and head into the hut like I’m told.
There’s a young bloke in uniform behind a desk.
“Papers”.
I give him my passport, which is the only document I have that he can’t poke holes in.
“Papers for the motorbike”. I give him my tattered registration papers.
He goes through the whole thing, line by line. Its two A4 pages, back and front. 80% of the info is irrelevant - "how to transfer vehicle ownership" and shit like that. He reads it all.
*Peanut.*
He gets up from his desk and heads out to my bike. He gets on hands and knees, and starts cross-checking the frame number and engine number with the rego. The engine number is 14 digits long. The frame number, 17 digits long.
Peanut is obviously on the hunt for anything not right in the paperwork that he can try to trip me up on.
Idiot.
He’s looking in all the wrong places; there’s more ammo in my dodgy papers than he’d know what to do with, and this moron can't spot the woods from the trees.
Thank Christ he’s incompetent.
He takes a look at my throwover saddlebags on the back of the bike. “These are illegal.”
*Huh?*
“What?”
“These”, he points again, “this luggage is bad, it’s illegal in Liberia”.
That's a novel approach...
“Why?”
“Where is the support underneath? They have no support. This is illegal!”
I can see what he’s driving at; the "throwovers" get chucked on the bike the same way you'd chuck a saddle on a horse. There's no need for underneath support.
I can see how he might think that they’re suspended there by some sort of witchcraft, as I've got the joining on the seat covered by a spare tyre and camping gear.
But *illegal?*
Absurd.
I explain how it works but he insists that it's illegal to have luggage with no support in Liberia.
I unpack everything.
Show him how it straddles the seat. Secure. See?
I take his silence as a crisis of confidence and pinch my papers off him while he’s thinking of what he can do next and quickly walk away.
There’s a guy selling bottles of donkey piss petrol over the other side of the road so I busy myself with buying a “gallon of gas” off him.
I’ve got no idea how many litres to a gallon, so I don’t really know where I should be haggling. I'm probably getting done in the arse...
When I get back to the bike Peanut is back in the hut and I’m away again.
---
Nature rolls by.
More forest and more young naked topless women painted white.
I take a break. Someone has nicked my roll of gaffa tape and my spare batteries from a pocket on my bags.
No prizes for guessing who "someone" is.
How petty can you get? The roll of gaffa was practically finished, and the cheap, shitty, Chinese AA’s are worth about 10 cents each.
Pathetic.
---
Eight hours and nearly three hundred clicks of riding later and I pull into a random village whose name I don’t know.
I’m cooked.
Wrecked. It’s been a massive day.
Eight hours...
It blows my mind that I used to spend this much time, five days out of seven, sitting in a chair, in front of a computer screen, in the sky prison.
It’s an *enormous* amount of time.
I find "accommodation", if you could call it that... To turn the lights off I have to unscrew the bulb... And if you want to see anything while taking a bucket shower in the communal basin then you’d better light a candle...
Suboptimal.
---
Up in the morning, and straight away I’m *desperate* to get to Harper.
It shouldn’t be far but still I want to get there as fast as possible. I don't know why, but it feels important.
On the way out of the village I buy a half gallon of gas with the last of my Liberian dollars.
The pull to get going as soon as possible - and skip breakfast - is strong. I'm almost frantic.
I set off, I'm out of the village without eating.
Then I think better of it, and turn back.
*Why am I rushing??*
I exchange ten American dollars and buy some breakfast. Questionable brown meat with palm butter and rice. Heavy going.
I don't think to chew; I'm *still* rushing.
After seagulling breakfast I hot step it back to the bike with a full gut.
As I’m putting on my helmet I freak out.
*Panic.*
Breakfast isn’t even going to touch the sides. I’m going to shit my pants. Now. Right here. Oh *god*.
*Where can I shit??*
I jump on the bike - I don't even do up my chin strap - and *fly* out of the village.
I need to find a patch of forest. *Stat!*
As I make my get away I start to level out and calm down.
I'm not going to make a mess. I never was...
I’ve lost all confidence in my gut. That's obvious. The slightest tremor and I - figuratively - shit myself.
I need to get on top of this. I can't be terrified after every meal.
---
The road has turned to shit.
The rains have fucked it.
Any sort of incline or decline has rivers of water channelling through it. These rivers run hodgepodge down the road wherever they want - like veins - carving out deep channels as wide as my tyres.
Tricky to negotiate.
The ones that run in the same direction as the road aren’t so bad. I can see them easy, but the ones that run across the road, they’re bastards.
Impossible to spot until it's too late and you're in it. And if you land in one you’re going to ditch the bike at best, and end up over the handlebars at worst.
Looking out for them has my undivided attention...
Undivided attention isn't enough; I get caught out.
I’m heading downhill at a slow speed, but the steepness means that I can’t stop as quickly as I’d like. I get hemmed in by a deep trench that cuts in front of my path. I’ve spotted it way too late.
It’s a bike breaker.
I slam on my brakes and try to steer to the side to go through a part of the channel that looks like it’s not going to kill me. But steering and braking are too much for the tyres to do at the same time on the dirt road and the back tyre locks up and slides out violently.
I’m going to crash. But just as the bike’s about to slide out completely the two wheels smash, flush, right into the side of the ditch and the whole bike and I bounce back around to upright, popping perfectly into shape, and ride away.
A *huge* save.
It leaves me fizzing.
*What happens out here if you crash and snap a leg?*
---
*Logged.*
The old forest gives way to progress; Logged, and replaced with plantations.
Palm crops.
*Devastating.*
I wonder how much longer all the beauty I've seen in the last two days will be around for...
---
Counting kilometres. Ceaselessly looping the math of distance divided by speed equals time.
Over and over and over.
Ten kilometres - or 20 minutes - to Harper, and filthy black clouds rear their dirty heads out of nowhere.
They look like they're hanging so low they could touch the tops of the trees.
The dirtiest, darkest clouds I've ever seen. Near black, despite being in the middle of the day.
Ominous as fuck.
I whip the bike like a jockey into the final furlong.
I *fly* right under the blackest band of the clouds, without catching a single drop.
I reckon I’ve got away with this...
*Nope.*
It *hoses* rain. Big ol' fat rain.
There's more water in the air than air.
*Thick.*
In literally two seconds my jeans are soaked through, and I can feel it pouring down the back of my helmet and under the neck of my leather jacket.
This is going to ruin all my papers, and *fry* all my electrics.
I round a corner and there’s a checkpoint.
It's the first time I’ve ever been happy to see one.
Thank *Christ.*
I fly under the awning at full clip, not hitting the brakes till I'm out of the deluge. I slide to a stop.
I was in the rain for a full minute, *max*, and everything's drenched.
I check everything. Papers in my pockets are dry. My luggage is soaked, but only the outer clothes.
Lucky. Again.
They don't bother me at the checkpoint. We stand under the cover and watch the storm pass as it smashes a violent din against the tin roof a few inches over our heads.

## Chapter Sixteen
Harper.
Paradise, lost.
Beautiful and tragic.
Once upon a time it must’ve been a buzzing port town, small in size, but with grand buildings and huge mansions for the wealthy, perched on a skinny, elevated peninsula - much like Robertsport - with beautiful ocean and an endless stretch of beach.
The buildings are, without a doubt, the most overt display of opulence I’ve seen on the continent.
A proper jewel of West Africa.
Then the war came.
And the world stopped. Everything was abandoned, and no one came back.
In the handful of years that have passed since then, nature has taken it all back.
Who tells a tree where it can and cannot grow? Apparently no one.
Left to its own devices, nature has filled the derelict concrete shells that were once people’s houses with something beautiful; green.
*Everywhere.*
Creeping vegetation has coated the walls - inside and out - with living wallpaper.
It’s an indoor garden of Eden.
Parked in old living rooms are huge trees that have made the space their own; punching a hole in the roof as it grows to fill the space.
House after house, mansion after mansion, exploring them all; it’s all the same bittersweet scene. It leaves me with a sad smile at the tragedy of Liberia, yet the beauty of nature; it takes everything back once we're gone.
But if that was the beauty of nature over humanity, the beach is surely humanity over the beauty of nature.
The sandy beach stretches away to a long vanishing point. Infinite stretch. A long row of palm trees separates the ocean from an inland lake.
What should have been a beautiful stretch of pristine coastline has been soiled - literally - by shit.
*Human* shit.
Grenades and landmines of turd are *everywhere*.
I can't enjoy the walk for fear of something *awful* squelching through my toes.
When I take the risk to raise my eyes off the sand for a moment I'm greeted with a view of someone laying out fresh cable.
*Delightful.*
Anyway, enough of that shit. I get out of there and make my way to the shanty town fishing village as the sun sets.
I'm walking along the coast of the peninsula and at that moment the sun cuts through the clouds, shooting beams of light like some cliché vision of heaven. I’m not normally one for photography, but with the heavenly vista above, the ocean below, the peninsula on stage left and a fishing boat on stage right, even I can't pass this up.
So I take a photo. It’s a ripper. Like a goddamn oil painting.
While I’m admiring my good work a little kid comes up to me and motions for me to take a picture of him with the camera. I’m never one to poke a camera in someone’s face, *ever* - it’s touristy and tacky and it makes me squirm when I see others do it - but I take a picture of the kid anyway, and show him his picture on the screen. Bless the little guy, he’s delighted by it.
Then there’s yelling. In my direction.
A bloke comes running over, looking *furious*.
"You can’t take photos!!"
“What? Why not?”
He pulls out his wallet and flashes a card at me, right in my face.
*Liberia Immigration*.
Looks legit. But it’s so out of place; there is no immigration in Harper...
He tells me to follow him.
What’s this guy on about?
Am I actually in trouble, or not? *Am I??*
*Ugh*.
I follow him. Better to play it safe.
We head into a tin shanty restaurant. He tells me to sit down in a dark corner. Before I know it I’m hemmed in by him and all of his buddies. They’ve been drinking. They *are* drinking...
They all crowd in.
“Where is your permit!?”
“What? My permit for what??”
“To take photos!”
“What?? You don’t need a permit to take *photos.*”
“Yes you do, where is it??”
I’m sick of this permit shit. I’ve already been buggered once for questionable permits in this country, but this is *clearly* bullshit.
“No I don’t. What will I need a permit for next?? Breathing?!”
“Give me your camera.”
“What? No. Why?”
“You have been taking illegal photos, I need to see them.”
I hate this shit. I hate this guy like poison. Fucker. Wanker. Immigration douchebag.
I hate being beholden to the whims of pieces of shit like this guy. Especially when I’ve done *nothing* wrong.
I get out my camera and he goes to grab it, I jerk it back away from him and fend him off with my free hand. “You look with your eyes, not with your hands”.
I show him the photos I’ve taken.
“These are all illegal, you can’t take photos of these buildings. You have to delete them.”
“What!? No... That’s rubbish, these are fine. Who cares about trees in buildings?”
“Show me your papers”
“What? Why??”
He gets right up in my fucking face.
“Because I am Immigration! You do what I say! Where is your passport?”
His breath fuckin *reeks* of booze.
This is so fucking unreasonable it’s making me boil. I’d be angry if I wasn’t freaking out.
"I don't carry my passport."
“Where is it?”
“It’s at my hotel. It’s safer there.”
“No passport?”
“No, I *have* a passport, it’s at my hotel, we can go there now and I’ll show you,” I’m desperate to get myself out of this corner.
“You give me money.”
“What?? No. I don’t have any money.” And I look it too; grisly and grimy in my bashed up, weathered t-shirt and my pair of shitty “hobo pants”.
He laughs right in my face. “Hey, no embarrassment. No embarrassment...” He laughs again full in my face; That breath!
And what's fucking funny?
"Ok, I'm leaving."
I push my way out of there.
"No, you stay for a drink, ok? No embarrassment."
No. Fuck that and fuck you.
I tear out of there, heading back to my grubby hotel with a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I’m eating my rice and beans for lunch, trying to practice my French with the friendly chop shop owner from Cote d’Ivoire, and I’m accosted by a young white guy.
It's a typical ‘you’re white, I’m white, we should be friends’ encounter.
Esko the Fin. He’s here working for a non-government organisation (NGO) called the Danish Refugee Council.
The poor bastard has been in Harper, and Harper only, for over a year. Blows my friggin mind. I’ve been here for a day and a half and I’m ready to kick on...
Esko the fin proceeds to ruin my lunch by scaring the shit out of me with some fun facts about Cote d’Ivoire.
Apparently it’s a fucking *mess* over on the other side of the border. He’s a little skinny on the details, but apparently there’s a big refugee camp here in Liberia, full of people fleeing rebels in western Cote d’Ivoire who are going about killing people.
*I didn’t know that...*
Anyway, this guy obviously doesn’t get much in the way of visitors, and he’s keen as mustard to get a mob together for drinks so that we can have a proper chin wag.
Sounds great.
---
Night.
Turns out there are more whiteys in this village than I thought (I expected there to be just one: me).
We’ve got four. The additions are Tara the Yank - a chirpy, can-do go-getter in the way that only Americans can manage, and Bob the Irishman - a dour old bastard, who’s intent on steering the conversation towards how much of a dickhead I am.
Dickhead's maybe a bit strong. Perhaps *naïve* and *reckless* would be better words.
According to Bob, the Cote d’Ivoire rebels have crossed the border into Liberia to hide from the Cote d'Ivoire military. They sneak cross the border back into Cote d’Ivoire to carry out attacks and then come back again to Liberia to hide.
Anywhere within a hundred clicks of the border on the Liberian side is a serious no-go zone.
*I didn’t know that...*
Bob is giving me a serious chewing out for yesterday’s ride, which went straight through the no-go zone. Apparently I'm very lucky that something awful didn’t happen.
He say's my plan to continue on to the Ivory Coast is plain dumb. Dumb and reckless. Feckless.
He’s not mincing words, telling me I "could be killed”.
He’s dead serious about it.
The fear is contagious. It's giving me the fucking willies.
This isn’t the same as my mum telling me I could be killed; this guy is already in Liberia, so it’s safe to say that his tolerance for risk is a lot higher than most, and he is *still* telling me it’s a really bad idea.
Well, now what then?
I’ve painted myself into a corner. I’m stuffed. The only ways out of Harper are risking the road north that I just came in on, or risking the even riskier road east into Cote d’Ivoire as I’d planned.
Shit in both hands and ask which one you’d like to have.
I’d rather they just told me nothing; things were better when I was oblivious.

## Chapter Seventeen
Dread.
Nerves.
What greets me in the waking moment.
Must be a border crossing day...
In the end there really was no choice; the “don’t go to Cote d’Ivoire” option would involve bypassing it via Guinea to the north. Fuck that.
So. Let’s roll the dice.
Bob be damned.
---
The border is short jaunt from Harper, and checking out of Liberia is a piece of cake. It’s a remote border and there’s no traffic; quick and easy.
The border that separates the two countries is a river. A pretty big river. With no bridge.
I can see a couple of barges over on the other riverbank. I ask the locals at the border post what the go is.
Apparently the barges are going nowhere today; I’ve missed my window, and there’s no amount of money that could make them move.
So, that leaves those little fucking boats. Again...
A bloke floating in a carved out tree is looking at me hopefully.
Not gonna happen. I don’t have the stomach for this. Not today. And that river is waaaaay too wide.
Anyone who was at the Liberian border has gathered around me and the bike to see how this is going to end up. They’ll probably get some cheap entertainment out of this, and they’re coaxing me to give it a go.
No thanks.
I can see a boat on the other shore, one big enough to at least have a tiny motor on it. *That’s what I want.* But because no one’s moving between the borders it’s not going anywhere either.
So I wait.
My mate in the hollowed out tree isn’t doing me any favours; ferrying people back and forth, meaning that my motor boat isn’t getting the chance to fill up on the other side.
Just as I’m thinking it’s time to take my medicine and get in the canoe, the boat finally makes the crossing. I think the owner smelled some fat stacks and came across to collect.
The captain's a bit of an oddball; a little guy with only half a moustache, and I don’t mean half a mo like a Hitler style either, nor a pencil thin mo or anything like that, he’s just decided to only shave one half, so that half his face has a moustache and the other half doesn’t.
It's distracting me while I’m trying to concentrate on the haggle.
We strike a deal and load up the boat.
With many hands it's surprisingly easy to lift the bike and get it over the gunnels.
We gently chug across the border.
---
Back to French...
Half-Mo ends up sharking me on the deal by using a very favourable exchange rate.
There’s less people over this side who are keen to help lift the bike out of the boat, so it’s heavy as hell, leaving me literally dripping sweat in my leathers from the back-breaking effort.
Onto the border post.
It's a handful of buildings with a village market attached to it like a parasite.
Immigration is easy. Fill out a form, get the stamp. Immigration always seems to be a breeze, never complicated, never a hassle.
Then onto Customs for an LP for the bike, which always seems to be complicated, never breezy, *always* a hassle.
Humans cross borders with ease, motorbikes do not.
The young official tells me that the registration papers that I have plus my passport are good enough for Cote d’Ivoire, no need for a Laissez-Passer, no problem.
*Not again...*
I make the same arguments that I made with Uncle Sam, and they're equally useless.
It's so frustrating. Why the fuck don't they just give me one, even if I don't need it. What's it to them??
I'm not giving up this time.
We go in circles.
He cracks first. Tells me he’ll issue an LP for 10,000CFA.
That’s 25 bucks. That’s *double* the most I've ever paid. That’s rubbish.
I produce 4,000 CFA, 210 Liberian dollars and 1 US dollar. All counted, that’s about the equivalent of 6,000 CFA. He needs to meet me halfway...
Arguing ensues. I know the price is more than enough, so I stick to my guns.
He cracks, again.
I’m pretty pleased with myself. I've become a hardnosed sonofabitch.
He’s gets about halfway through filling out the LP, and he asks me what my mothers and fathers names are...
*What?*
“What? Por-qwar? Ce pour le moto?”
He stares at me like I’m a retard. “Oh, le moto??”
“Yeah, le moto!” What the fuck have we been talking about? Of course the motorbike!
The silly dickhead was writing out a LP for a person - not a bike.
An LP for a person?? *Is that even a thing??*
Buggered if that makes any sense.
I know that he's done it intentionally too; this guy’s not thick. Sure enough, he’s blaming me like it’s somehow *my* fuckup, and the cost goes up to 15,000CFA to cover the ruined LP.
*Fuck that.*
This is bloody extortion.
We’re both too pigheaded to back down now.
I'm certain I’ll wear him down. I’ll Shawshank it. Just chip away. I’ve got nowhere better to be.
---
An hour.
I get thirsty.
Then hungry.
And I crack.
I take his initial suggestion and just leave.
Winging it again.
*Fuck it.*
---
*Checkpoints.*
*Lots* of checkpoints.
I don't have the nerves for this...
No more bunting and ropes; *spike strips* over here.
Fuckin' *mean* ones.
Oddly, it's a good thing for me; cars can't fit through the gap they leave on the sides, but bikes can.
By the time the cops or army goobers realise from their roadside huts what’s going on I’m already past the spikes and *off*.
I can hear the trilling of angry whistles fade away as I crack on. *Bye bye!*
Fourth time, and there’s a bloke actually doing his job; standing smack bang in the middle of the road.
He waves me over.
He’s a big fucker too, with a big fuckin' machine gun. No escaping this. *Please ask for the passport.*
“Moto pap-ee-er”
*Shit*. I give him my bike’s rego papers.
He looks at it, with a perplexed look on his face. *Not good...*
“Ooo eh votre Laisser-Passez?”
Shit shit *shit!*
I pull over the bike and take my time taking off my helmet before my head melts. It's so fucking *hot*.
Now. How to play this...?
Another goober, a skinny bloke, has made his way over and wants to see my passport.
*Lovely.*
I give him my passport and we flick through the pages, talking about the journey so far, and I smoothly segue into my favourite distraction ploy: asking for directions.
It works a treat.
The two of them go into great detail of how to get to the next village, which, given there’s only one road, should have been pretty straight forward.
It’s perfectly steered the conversation; all talk of LP's forgotten.
I thank them for their crucial help, grab my papers and head off to waves and smiles. Like a goddamn magician.
I'm still on edge... This is a big country, and if four checkpoints on one stretch of road is anything to go by, there's going to be a shitload more to come.
I don't know how long my luck will last.
I’m still not really sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing that there is military crawling all over the place. I’ve got to deal with them all the fucking time, but at least I'm not being shot by rebels...
Already I wish that I had of swallowed my pride and paid the outrageous fee at the border for the Laissez-Passer and had that be it; it's really not worth the stress.
I'm going to do a Ziguinchor, and get a LP from Customs in my first port of call; San Pedro.

## Chapter Eighteen
*Nope.*
After running around for half a day at the utterly incompetent Douanes in San Pedro, and being told it’s impossible, I finally talk my way up a few flights of stairs to the big boss; the man who can get stuff done.
The chief is sitting in his big office, in a big chair, in full uniform.
We chat and he says that he can indeed make a Laissez-Passer for me - no problem - and it’ll *only* cost 30,000 CFA.
I laugh openly in his face. Can’t help it.
That’s three times more than the ass at the border was bending me over for.
I meet absurdity with absurdity and pitch it back at him with a zero missing off the back - 3,000 CFA. He looks faux-offended; like I farted in his august presence.
This isn’t going anywhere.
I thank him for his time and walk out.
---
Despite the bad start I reckon I’m going to like Cote d’Ivoire. It’s a bit more modern than most places in this neck of the woods, I can see that already; the toothpaste here is *actually* toothpaste.
Things are looking up.
I want to get to Yamoussoukro, the country's capital (wrap your mouth around that one: Ya-moh-sue-crow). Yamoussoukro is the capital of CI in the same way that Canberra is the capital of Australia, or Washington the capital of the States.
It’s the capital, sure, but it’s not really.
Anyway, I’ve been told that there’s some stuff out there that’s worth a look.
It’d want to be pretty special. There’s four hundred clicks to cover, into roads I don’t know, for a destination I know nothing about.
One thing's for sure: there’s not going to be any viable places to sleep in between here and there - unless the shit *really* hits the fan...
By rights, I should be heading east as quick as the bike can take me, out of the really dodgy area of Cote d'Ivoire and into somewhere safe. Instead I’ll be going mostly north, parallel to the border, where I really shouldn't be.
Four hundred click of checkpoints...
The word is dread. Dread, and nerves.
But for some reason I'm gonna do it anyway.

## Chapter Nineteen
Yamoussoukro.
I ride into Yam' in a dripping lather of exhaustion.
Relieved.
*Eight hours* in the saddle.
*What a day.*
My headspace has been dominated by doing mental math. Predictions. Time equals distance divided by speed. Again...
Hardly a spare other thought crept into my mind.
The hamster wheel of stupid, irrelevant calculation. Maddening and exhausting.
The closer to Yam', the more time seemed to draw out.
The last hour felt like a small infinity.
Little eternity.
Didn’t help that there's nothing to see.
Cote d'Ivoire seems to be nothing but rows upon rows of palm or rubber plantations. As a side-note, who knew that rubber came from trees??
So weird.
Anyway. After the rich green forests of eastern Liberia, it's not a stretch of the imagination to think of what must have been destroyed in the name of money and progress.
Tragic.
And the checkpoints! Bloody hell. Every village had at least one. At least!
Lots and lots of shrieking whistles and pissed off cops in the mirrors today.
Fuck 'em; I ain’t stopping... If I stopped every time someone blew their whistle at me I’d be closer to San Pedro than Yam' right now.
I got stopped five times. Three of those I shook hands, introduced myself, apologised for my horrendous French, and asked for directions to Yamoussoukro before they could even get a word in.
After getting instructions I would say thank you for the help, put the bike into gear and they’d let me go. No papers shown, *nothing*.
For two I wasn’t so lucky. One bloke asked for my papers, so he got my passport, then asked for the bike papers, and was suitably confused by the bikes rego to think that it was enough.
The last bloke wasn’t so thick.
He caught me out trying to dodge a checkpoint by hiding in the gridlock of the only major village I came across.
“Ca,” he holds up the rego papers "ce *pa* bien".
I tell him of course it is, and ask him how he thinks I got this far - through the plethora of fucking checkpoints - if the papers aren’t any good?
Riddle me that.
He wasn't convinced, “No, pas bien, you give money”. I reply that I have none.
“You give me money. You give me money for water.”
Ha! Really? Money For water? You sure? A half-litre of filtered water in a sealed plastic sack costs less than 5 cents.
I empty my out my pockets and I’ve got 500CFA in coin - a touch over a dollar - which I put into his hand. He looks at me like I’ve just farted. Been getting that a lot lately...
He begrudgingly gives me back my rego.
Easy!
After six hours of riding the road turned from dirt into pretty serviceable tarmac.
Then it turns into a four lane highway that wouldn’t be out of place in Europe...
I've never seen anything like it.
Not on this continent anyway...
It's flawless; a proper highway with painted markings, streetlights, flyover bridges and big blue metal signs pointing the way to Yamoussoukro. *The works.*
Fuck, Yamoussoukro must be a *behemoth*. And that’s not good; I don’t like big cities. After a big day like this I don’t relish the idea of looking for accommodation in a crazy big, bustling city; not after what happened in Monrovia.
I’m nervy and tired enough already.
The four lanes turn into six. A lonely six; There’s no one else on the road.
*Where is everyone?*
A few empty junctions with traffic lights on them(!) and the GPS tells me that I’ve arrived in Yamoussoukro.
I look all about me. All I see is a village...
*What’s going on here?*
I keep riding on.
Then, *bang.*
My jaw goes slack, the bike coasts.
Someone’s dumped the Vatican in a paddock...
I shit you not. The fucking *Vatican*.
I’m looking at it. *Right at it.*
It’s *immense*. Colossal. The real deal.
My brain’s not doing well with this, at all.
*How?*
How is the Vatican - Saint Paul's fucking cathedral - in West Africa? In a cow paddock...
Just... *What??*
The bike is stopped, but I don't remember when I did that. 
My hanging jaw turns into a grin fit for a loon.
This is fucking *awesome!* This is going to be *fucking* awesome!
I zoom into the village, find any accommodation, throw my shit on the floor, and hot step it to the Vatican.
It just keeps getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, till finally I'm gripping the bars of the fence, trying to move my head about to get a better view.
It's *enormous*.
The heavens open, and it starts to piss rain on me.
It’ll have to wait till tomorrow...
I walk back to the village in a soaked daze.
---
Over dinner, I bend the ear of a local.
I’ll give you the clippings: Cote d'Ivoire was ruled by a democratically elected president for a bunch of years till he died. "Democratically" is, I imagine, a stretch; folks who rule for life don't tend to not be dictators... Anyway, in that time, the President and the country had become quite wealthy with all those juicy palm plantations. Cote d'Ivoire came to be known as “the jewel of West Africa”. Now our buddy the President was getting on in years, and in his old age he went a little nuts. He wanted *legacy.* So he glorified Yamoussoukro for no reason other than that it was his home village; he made it the capital of the country, and spent a fuck-tonne of money on it. *Splash*. He built all of those fancy roads, he built his presidential palace here (complete with a moat filled with crocodiles. *Believe it*), he built a massive conference centre that’s so grand looking that I mistook it for a football stadium, and he built the *biggest church in the world*. In the *whole friggin world*. Think about that for a sec. The biggest church in the world is in a cow paddock in West Africa. It’s sitting there, right now. Unbelievable, isn't it? Anyway, I wasn’t far wrong in thinking that someone had picked up the Vatican and dropped it here – the design of the dome and the "courtyard out the front" is a replica of the Vatican, which, I'm told, pissed off the Pope quite a bit...
So. There you have it.
And all that in an otherwise unremarkable little village.

## Chapter Twenty
Up close...
*Absurd* is the word...
I can't stop shaking my head, open mouthed, smiling.
It’s the most beautiful church I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen some doozies.
On arrival at the gates of yesterday I'm skimmed in along with a group, split into two precise columns. I don't have any idea what the fuck is going on - the preamble was in French - but I just go with the flow.
We make our way solemnly down the immense marble floored grounds leading up to the basilica - hundreds of meters - in silence.
I'm struck by the similarity of this gargantuan basilica with an egg in an eggcup.
I’ve got to stifle a giggle. It looks *just* like one.
Finally we get to the front doors. It’s obvious that there’s already something going on inside.
Our whole group gets hosed down with an overly generous lashing of holy water. We’re let in.
The place is packed. Everyone is already seated. There’s gotta be *thousands* in here.
I take one of the last seats available with the rest of my group.
I don't think I'm meant to be here... I think I might have just jagged a massive win; right place, right time.
I've got my own air conditioning vent in the seat in front of me...
*Opulence.*
From the outside it was imposing and impressive, from the inside it’s just plain beautiful.
*Stunning.*
The church is a grand, perfect cylinder with the altar at its centre. Around the perimeter there are no walls. It’s all columns and archways of immense stained glass windows.
The *colours*...
My god...
The morning sunlight is pouring through the windows. The depth and richness of all those colours - blues and golds and greens and reds - like thousands of shards of precious stone. Sitting in here feels like being in the middle of a many coloured, many faced jewel.
Awe inspiring.
*How the fuck can they afford this??*
I peel my eyes off the windows for a moment and get lost in the dome above; *more* stained glass; swirling rings of blue and gold, encircling to meet in the middle at a dove in white.
Magnificent.
---
The *mass* starts.
It's a wonder that anyone could pay attention to it, given the surroundings. And the fact that it's in French makes a slam dunk of my decision not to listen.
I'm more interested in the wooden adornment built into the end of each of the luxurious pews. It looks remarkably like a fist sized Easter egg in an egg cup.
For the life of me I can’t shake the notion that we’re all here to worship the mighty Lord and Savoir: *Egg.*
I gawk about for a long time, till I finally feel like I've soaked and taken a memory of every aspect of the building. When there's nothing left to do, I finally start paying attention.
This is obviously not your run-of-the-mill mass; there are more priests up on that alter than you could shake a stick at; I count twenty. There are four whities in amongst them and a bloke with a big, tall, fancy, papal looking hat.
Must be the biggen.
In the same way that McDonald's tastes the same anywhere you go, so does a mass. After getting dragged to church on Sundays for many years, I know it by heart, and I can recognise what's going on, even in French.
No one else seems to know what’s going on...
To stand, to sit, or to kneel? That is the question.
There's no consensus.
At one point in the mass there's a third of the faithful doing each.
---
Two hours in.
Even the priests don't even seem to know what to do next. There are some pregnant pauses...
*This is so awkward...* I want to run away.
There's a bloke two rows back from me who is snoring. *Loudly*.
A woman a couple of seats to my left decides that now is a great time to flop a tit out and starts breastfeeding her kid.
The choir fire up. They're superb. I close my eyes and get taken to a cathedral in Europe with their sound.
Then the keyboard gets going. Small and tinny and cheap. It can't fill the room.
It's playing cheesy pre-loaded backing tracks and melodies.
This is so *weird*.
I think of the place, and think of what this mass could have been...
---
Three hours in two other blokes are asleep. It's starting to become understandable.
I reflect on the lunatic who thought this was a good idea, the President, and come to the sad conclusion that we're actually very much alike: We both have the money and the ability to make a difference in Africa, but we’re both spending it in ways that are self-serving, selfish, frivolous, and maybe more than a little megalomaniacal.
Put more simply, we’ve both got our heads up our own arses.
The priests all leave and everyone seems to be looking about for a sign that it's ok to leave ourselves.
We're released from this stunning, gorgeous purgatory.
---
Dinner costs me 30 cents, a whole pineapple for desert costs the same, and mangoes – the biggest you’ve ever seen – cost 10 cents each. This is my kind of place...
On the walk home I come across a car outside the butchers section of the market. The boot is open, and full of chickens.
*Packed* with chickens.
*Alive* chickens.
They're just sitting there, huddled together.
No one's watching them. They aren't tethered. They could escape. *Easily*.
I stand there, eating a mango and watching.
Not one of them makes a move.
They've trapped themselves.
I think back a mere year ago, back to the skyprison... The office...
A chicken, waiting patiently in the boot of the car for the butcher...

## Chapter Twenty One
Wake up.
Sickening, dripping dread. I feel it. The *moment* that I know where I am.
My chest tightens. My heart rate revs. Kicks.
A moving day...
Every moving day has somehow become a little terror.
This place, Yamoussoukro, which just a day ago was scary and foreign and unknown, has become my safe place. My safe zone. It’s become my home. I’m settled. Now the next place becomes the scary, the foreign, the unknown.
The terrifying.
But I have to keep moving.
There's no choice.
I have to unhinge myself from the safe place, and head out into a scenario with so many variables, so many unknowns, and so many worries.
It's starting to happen every single time I shift.
I know already that when I arrive at my destination the relief will be huge. The weight will lift off my shoulders, the press will lift off my chest. My heart rate will finally drop. My frazzled, hamster-wheel mind will slow down.
It will feel like a drug.
The terror and the relief are like different sides of the same coin, with no middle ground; quantum leaps from terror to relief and back again.
*I’m sick of it.*
Every single time, I form this attachment; every single time, I’m scared to leave; every single time, the unknown road and unknown destination are scaring the shit out of me. And the whole routine keeps paying itself forward. It started when I left my home and got on a plane...
I’m doing it now on such a regular basis that it’s unsettling.
It’s starting to wear me thin.
It seems to get worse every time.
*Compounding*.
There’s *always* something to worry about, and if I let this hand wringing go unchecked I’ll drive myself mad.
I want to get back to that smiling, oblivious, carefree, happy-go-lucky idiot who was just taking it as it comes; "don’t let it be a problem till it’s a problem"; that guy who slept at night.
The attitude has gotta change.
No one made me do this. It was me.
It was adventure I wanted. Wasn’t it?

## Chapter Twenty Two
Well. It worked.
I changed my attitude, and riding went from being a purgatory to a pleasure.
Over the last few days I’ve ridden through - and out of - Cote d'Ivoire, with barely a hitch; no issues with the cops, military, anyone.
I’ve got a new visa in my passport for Togo. 
The only flaky moment was when my clutch cable snapped in a place called Abidjan; the skyscrapered "true capital" of Ivory Coast.
I’d never really paid that much attention to the clutch cable, but it essentially connects the hand lever on the handle bars to the engine in much the same way that a those steel wires on a bicycle connect your handles to the brakes.
I’m lucky enough to have a spare. *Two spares,* even. Easy enough then...
*Nope.*
For the life of me I couldn't figure the bloody thing out. After hours of sitting on the floor, hours of looking at the spare and the existing cable, hours of scratching my head, hours in the blazing, maddening heat, I was no closer to fixing the thing.
It just didn't make sense.
The spare and the original just don't *look* the same...
A “mechanic” came to help me out. As soon as he sat down he starts bending the cable when it clearly wasn't supposed to be bent. That’s how it is with African mechanics – the quickest and easiest solution to a problem is the right one - never mind how it’s *supposed* to work, how it’s *designed* to work; if it works, it works.
That’s their mindset, but it’s not mine. I cracked it at him for putting a kink in the cable and buggering it. He put down that freshly ruined cable and then, inexplicably, picked up my second spare and starts twisting that like a clown making balloon animals for children. I flew right off the handle.
Silly dickhead.
He left.
After another hour or so staring at it I gave in. I bodged it - a rough one - just tying the loose end of the cable on with a granny knot. A very agricultural bodge indeed.
Doing some checking afterwards I discovered that the mugs back in England had given me the completely wrong set of spares.
Useless fucks.
After that debacle I checked in at a shitty hotel and found some internets, to which I was greeted with this message from my Mum, which I'll repeat here verbatim:
"Ok I was just driving home and they were talking on the Abc about an epidemic in Africa of a disease called abola ( I just googled it but I obviously have the wrong spelling) and people are dying. They are going to restrict enter and it's the place you are at now..FUCK!! And a place called Ginny ( not sure of spelling but that is how it sounds!) you get diarrhoea and then you bleed and die. Apparently over 70 people have died including westerns who were there helping. I am not been alarmist I am just telling you what I heard on the radio.
Please please get out of there!!!
Love you xx"
*Abola?*
My mum can spell... Grammar maybe not so much, but she can spell. It was obviously written pretty frantically. The "FUCK!!" also gives it away. I reckon she means *Ebola.*
All I know about Ebola comes from a Weird Al Yankovic song called Horrorscope, which - for reasons I can't explain - I committed to memory when I was 15 years old. Here's the lyric:
"Pisces!
Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos
With the Ebola virus
You are the true Lord of the Dance
No matter what those idiots at work say"
So that's not overly descriptive. Nor particularly serious...
I look it up. Ebola virus.
It *is* serious.
It's already spread to Liberia. Two confirmed cases there...
It's infectious.
*Really* infectious; you can catch it as easily as contacting someone's *sweat*.
Symptoms are fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, unexplained haemorrhage from nose and mouth. Then fucking *death*.
Back in that shithole brothel in Monrovia I could have ticked all of those boxes except two...
I think about that Monrovian marketplace, dripping wet with everyone else's sweat... 
Nine in ten who catch it, die.
I feel ok now...
Plus, it's not in Cote d'Ivoire.
It'll be contained; they’ll close borders. I'm safe.
I reply to mum with that.
JB's deeper in the rack than I am. I tell him he might want to put some geographical distance between himself and all of that. And if he starts to haemorrhage he might want to get it checked out...
Time to *move*.
---
The border’s *wild*.
Busy enough that whole villages have popped up to service them.
People everywhere.
Getting the bike to the front is like riding through a mosh pit of a thousand people who are all head and shoulders taller than you.
I crush some toes and park up.
I hustle and muscle *hard* to get to the poor swamped bastard sitting behind the desk at Immigration.
It's like a scene from Wall Street during the Great Depression; people frantically throwing paper everywhere.
Once through the melee I’m stamped out of Cote d'Ivoire. It's too busy here for anyone to give a fuck about my bike or the fact I've ridden though all of the country without the correct papers...
Stoked with that.
I cross a river (with a bridge, for a change) and I'm on to the Ghana post.
The Queens English. Again.
I smash my way through another mob of sweaty people to get the passport stamped by Immigration. Piece of cake.
I’m in. No worries.
I head to Customs, which is less packed, and get flatly rejected.
The woman behind the glass window will do nothing other than stamp a *Carnet de Passage*; that yellow pad of papers that JB carries around.
No Laissez-Passers.
No Temporary Import Permits.
It's Carnet de Passage or bust.
I’m fucked. Stranded.
I panic.
While pacing around the post in a fizz of panic, I waylay a bloke who looks like a boss as he’s walking past. He’s a big fucker, and dressed in full uniform with a military looking hat and everything. I shake his hand, introduce myself, and I ask him if I can get a Laissez-Passer. He tells me, sternly “Impossible. We don’t do Laissez-Passers” he keeps on walking.
I jump in front of him, cutting him off "Well, a TIP then?”
He softens. I don't know why. “Why do you want a TIP? Why don’t you have your Carnet?”
“Because it’s cheaper...”
He laughs his head off.
I didn’t think it was that funny...
He good-naturedly waggles his finger at me, smiling “You travellers, eh!? Where have you come from?”
I sound off the roll call of countries travelled and show him my passport - which is starting to become quite the document - and point out the bike I've done it on.
He fuckin' *loves* it.
“Haha, ok, ok. The TIP’s are for ECOWAS citizens only, but for you we will have an exception.”
You fuckin *beauty.*
---
It takes us about half an hour to do the paperwork – this obviously isn’t standard, I’ve obviously gotten very, very lucky here. He asks me about my insurance and I get away with using my irrelevant UK insurance.
I get an enormous document of an LP in my hot hands for thirty six of the local clams, called *Cedis*.
Roughly 15 dollars.
We shake hands and I thank him profusely.
He calls me “a wonderful man”, and I’m touched. It’s the nicest thing anyone’s said to me in a long time.
Ghana.
A peaceful country. I have full papers. Life is good.

## Chapter Twenty Three
Standing on the shore at the end of a long, hot, sweaty day’s ride in the leathers, and I’m wondering if it’s really worth risking it.
Over the last few day’s I’ve travelled along the Ghanaian coastline, dying for a swim but not daring.
The sea has been *furious*.
A thunderstorm - and a tropical one at that - on the day I crossed the border has whipped the Gulf of Guinea into a frenzy.
The carnage of the mashed up seas and the howling of the breeze would make my glasses mist with salt water even hundreds of meters back from the shoreline.
*Violent.*
But today, here in *Cape Coast*, the wild weather has departed, leaving raging sunshine.
The stillness of air and sea leave no signs of the storm that’s been.
*Except one.*
The swell; It’s *massive.*
Deadset fucking huge.
I’m squinting out at it without my glasses on. Nothing’s sharp, but I can still see vague shapes.
A big lump of clean water, moving fast, forming up into a towering, clean wall, and dumping down in a straight line along the whole length of the beach.
I might not be seeing it so well, but I can sure as shit *hear* it; that *roar...*
I've spent the day melting in my leathers. Even this late in the afternoon the sun is still belting down. Unrelenting.
I'm stuck in two minds. Even from here the waves are intimidating. Out there - and up to my neck in it - it’s going to be sketchy at best, *really* sketchy at worst... And what about currents? Rips? I know nothing about the local conditions...
It’s a Saturday and the beach is *packed* with Ghanaians, all enjoying the beach. The “beach resort” that I’m staying at - which is full of whities (a fun novelty) - is brimming with tourists having drinks at the bar that backs right onto the beach sand.
Everyone’s enjoying the view.
Yet not a single person - *not one* - is in the water. Not one Ghanaian, not one tourist.
Join those dots...
Well... *Fuck it.*
I’m a strong swimmer...
I run at it and jump in.
It's good. *Really* good... There’s something so refreshing about being back in the ocean again. I realise how much I’ve missed it over the last few weeks.
The upside is that I’ve got it all to myself.
---
I nearly get fucking murdered on the swim out - had to swim like stink - but I've managed to negotiate my way past the breakers to the other side; gently treading water.
On one side is a perfect flat stillness, on the other, *carnage*. As the swell comes on it sucks at the water in front of it, pulling me into it, the face rears up and I'm pulled up and over the huge crest as it passes through.
At the last moment of each wave I turn my head back to the beach, to glimpse down from the top of the breaking wave, back down at where the wave is going to smash. I’m so high up that it brings on a queasy vertigo. It's a long, *long* way down. A moment later and the wave curls on itself. The thunder rolls, water erupts, spraying everywhere like a bomb. An awesome display of power.
I don't feel safe.
The big forces are making me feel very small.
All I’d been thinking about on the swim out was getting past the waves and into this safety of the flat water beyond. But - now that I’m here - the equal and opposite question presents itself; how the fuck do I get back in??
I feel an undercurrent pulling me further out. Away from the beach. I can't see well, but it feels like the beach is getting further away.
*Panic.*
In a snap, I decide I want out. *Now.*
The “smallest” wave of the set is coming. I swim like hell to try to catch it. I’ve only got a few seconds to get to the break, so it’s head down, full stroke and a six-kick.
With my eyes shut, I feel it starting to pick me up and I go for it; *thrash, thrash, thrash.*
The wave takes over. I pop my head out and take as big a breath as I can, skimming like a rock down the face of the wave. The big bastard breaks right on me.
The *roar...*
Washing machine.
I feel my forward momentum stop, change direction. I'm going backwards, up. Feet first, it bends me over backwards, and throws me over the falls again.
I'm forced into a horrible back bend.
Vulnerable. It'd take nothing to break my back...
It slams me back down like a plaything.
I rag doll over and over in the wash till I can figure out which way is up again.
I break the surface and suck air.
*I'm ok...*
The luck of not breaking by back on a sandbar has quickly turned into unluck of having nothing to stand on to get my breath back.
I need to breathe, but I also need to swim. *Now.*
I'm in the worst place I could be...
*I get to it.*
I swim for a few seconds and then turn around to time my breath and duck dive under the next wave; I don't want it catching me without a lungful of air.
Looking out to sea I spot a hazey blob in the corner of my vision. No more than a hop, skip and a jump away, just a bit deeper out than me. A black blob.
Thank Christ there’s at least *one* other person out here...
The blob’s hamming it up. He's waving to his mates on the shore, carrying on like a pork chop.
Yeah, well done mate. I'm sure everyone’s very impressed...
I turn to look to the shore to see what they’re doing; I get a quick glimpse of lots of black blobs, not moving much. Odd... It's like life on the beach has come to a stand-still.
I’m smacked in the back of the head by the next avalanche of white wash. Off guard. I’ve got no wind in the lungs. I’m empty.
My lungs wrench at me. I keep somersaulting...
Finally, I can tell up from down. I pop out of the wash, and *breathe*.
That was a *long* hold under. Yuck.
I check out the blob. I freestyle over to him, right up to the point where the blob's face becomes clear, and I know that I’m wrong; I’ve never seen a face like it. He’s terrified. *Beyond* terrified. *Way* beyond it...
I flick my head back to the shore. Lots of blobs, none moving.
Where the *fuck* are the surf lifesavers in their rubber ducky?
It takes a moment to settle into my spinning head. This is Ghana, *no one's coming...*
I turn back to the face.
He’s my age.
He’s half trying to swim, half trying to wave for help. He can't swim; even in the calm between waves he can't keep his head out of water enough. His neck is tilted back to try to keep his gaping mouth from going under.
His eyes are *wild*, looking down his nose in my direction. Face shaking.
Faarrrrrk...
I swim over to him. I still can’t stand, and I still can’t believe that he’s actually drowning. “Are you ok mate??”
What a dumb fucking question...
He grabs onto my right wrist with both of his hands - latches on. As his head goes under again we cop the next set of white wash.
*Fuck*.
Neither of us lets go as we take a roll together in the wash.
I find the surface first. I’ve got to kick like fuck to keep my head above the water while I try to pull him up. He’s not doing either of us any favours; I can still feel both of his hands clamped tightly onto my wrist, and without him swimming for himself it's like trying to drag up a sack of spuds.
In between every frog kick my head keeps going underwater, just enough to cover my mouth, I’m not really getting a chance to breathe.
He's not letting go...
*Panic.* A *monster* dump of adrenaline. *Fizz!*
I drag him to the surface and try to put some of my effort into going forward, to be beach, but we’re not going anywhere fast. There’s *such* a long way to the shore.
The shore... I turn my head to have a quick look. No one’s in the water.
I turn back to see the top half of a terrified face, and the rush of white water, coming on fast behind him. I stop pulling him, and with the extra slack I put my head well above water and take the biggest breath that I can before the white wall hits.
In the wash there’s one thought that’s overwhelming me, the only thing that matters: *Don’t let him drown you.*
Totally self-centred.
It’s weird; my mind is clear enough to reflect on how cowardly it is. It’s also thinking of the glory I can pull if I get him back to the shore... Cowardice and vanity. And not a whole lot else. Never mind what happens to this guy. I don’t care.
*Coward.*
My lungs and legs are on fire. I get to the surface, kicking like an epileptic frog and try to breathe, but it’s not enough. I slowly dredge him up. He’s been a long time under, and I don't reckon he got a breath in before he went under. The look on his face tells me that he’s figured the same thing out as I have: *This isn’t working.*
It’s not going to work.
He’s drowning now.
*Right now.*
He freaks out. *Completely.* His hands scramble up my arm like he’s climbing a rope, *fast*, and he gets to my shoulders and hauls himself on top of me, pushing me down and under.
*Bastard!* Arrgh *fuck!!!*
I try to swim up with both of my arms now. Frantic. But I can’t. My whole body is on fire, there's acid in my veins, with a special kind of burning reserved for my lungs.
I’m trying to swim and fight him at the same time.
I give that up and shove him off then pull him down, and not a second too soon because I’m panicking, out of oxygen, drowning, but I'm still well under.
My hands are at the surface but my head's not as the next layer of wash comes piling over the top and knocks me around.
*Oh no...*
This is it...
I’ve been under for too long.
*Gonna die gonna die gonna die.*
Without the young bloke as dead weight I make the surface far quicker. And *breathe*. I'm choking and coughing on water; half of it's been swallowed, the other half went down the wrong pipe. It's grating and burning the back of my throat as I burk it up.
I’m shit scared. Wide-eyed fucking *terrified*.
Fuck this. Fuck him. *I’m out*.
I don’t even think of staying out there; not for a moment, even though I've got my breath back and I'm swimming fine.
I want out of this water, right fucking *now*.
I freestyle slowly for the shore, leaving the young bloke out there to drown.
As I throw in the towel, a few Ghanaians - young blokes themselves - come swimming out the other way; if you can call *that* swimming...
*I don't care.*
They can manage it. I want nothing to do with it.
I get to the shore. *Safe.* Slumped with hands on knees.
My head is clear, and cold.
I'm fine; so I have to act it up that I'm in worse shape than I really am, lest people think I gave it up too early; I don't want to be judged.
And then it sinks in: the kid's dead. And I’m alive. And I threw it in early. *Way* too early. I could have stayed out there, tried again after getting my breath back. I hardly fucking had a crack at it. I must look like I’ve had a crack, sure, but I know the score... And now someone's dead.
*Coward.*
I’m so disappointed with myself; at the pointy end, when *truly* tested - a *true* test of character, a *true* test of the man - and I copped right out.
Fucking *dead*.
That look on his face...
Standing on the beach, I know all of this. Yet, even now, *this very moment*, I won't go back out there. I’ve got my breath back, I’m still alive, I’m actually fine. I *could* go back out and try again. I *could* go out there and fix this, undo this cowardly shit. But I don’t dare to.
Instead, I keep up the act; coughing and spluttering; looking like I’m suffering a lot harder than I have a right to, so that no one that was watching - and there are hundreds now - will know how gutless I am.
It's disgusting.
---
A local bloke comes dodging through the crowd with a surfboard.
A longboard.
*Good.* That’ll help.
He comes down to where I am - at the point where the wet sand meets the dry - and holds the board out to me.
*What?*
Nah. *Nope*. I can’t... *No.*
He insists.
I take the board. What else can I do?
I haven’t turned to look at what’s going on out in the wash since I left it. And I’ve got no idea what’s going on. He could be still alive, he might be dead. I don’t know.
*Time is of the essence.*
Without really caring - and I can hardly believe this myself as I watch myself do it - I put the surfboard on the ground and start untying the velcro on the leg rope that tethers to the board.
*I’m a piece of shit.*
The first strip of velcro comes off, then the next, and the loop is open. Now I’ve got to get it around my wrist. It’s like putting on a giant wrist watch – that awkward action when you only have one hand free. I’m fiddling with the velcro and I can’t get it right.
It's taking *ages...* The clock is ticking. Fast. And I’m in slow motion.
Some poor fucker is dead or dying, and I’m tying a leg rope to my wrist.
Covering my own arse.
Selfish bastard. *Self self self.*
I fail at it once. Then twice. I realise too late that it probably would have been quicker to use both my hands and tie the fucking thing around my ankle where it's supposed to fucking be; it's called a leg rope for a reason... But I’m too far along now, and I keep at it.
I wonder what the people watching are thinking of me.
*Pragmatic?*
*Scumbag?*
Dunno.
Third time’s a charm.
*Finally* I jog into the water, awkwardly get on the board, and start paddling.
The first wave of wash knocks me off the board.
I can’t stand, even this close to the shore, and I labour to get back on. My arms don’t feel like working anymore.
The second wave knocks me off, again. I can't get back on the board till another lot of whitewash has come through.
Finally, I manage to negotiate a few waves of wash without falling off, and make progress.
I make it out to the three guys who had gone out when I came in. They've been out here, treading water - and struggling at that. These blokes don’t look like they could swim in a bathtub, let alone out here in this heavy wash.
They’re yelling their heads off, hovering in a triangle around the fourth. The fourth is the young bloke.
All I can see of him is the slump of his back, and the back of his head - face down. That’s it, not moving.
Jesus effing *Christ*...
All the blokes treading water leave the body and come swimming over to the board, frantic, thrashing, and awkward - they each look like a dog that's been thrown into deep water for the first time.
They latch onto the surfboard like it’s just saved them.
Another wave of wash comes through and scatters us like ten pins, and I'm flung off the board.
Water’s all white foam and froth. I'm glad for the leg rope...
The four of us get back to the board and grab hold. We swivel our heads around. But the body has gone missing. Can’t see it anywhere.
*Vanished.*
All four of us are yelling now, panicking.
One of the guys spots something bobbing, sickeningly, in the water a few strides away.
*That’s it.*
No one’s actually on the board anymore; all four of us are in the water with one arm across it to stay afloat. We have to do an awkward one armed scramble with the free hands to get to the body.
The poor bastard's gone. Time’s up...
We’re all struggling and straining to pull him up onto the board, but there’s no way to get any purchase, no way to get any leverage to lift him onto the surfboard with. Not from down here in the water with him. He’s slippery, and he’s so goddamn *heavy.*
Incredibly, impossibly heavy.
All dead weight.
Another fucking wave of wash comes through but it's a small one, and we manage to keep hold of him and the board this time.
I don't know how, but we haul him onto the board and arrange him so he's lying straight. We point the longboard at the shore, and paddle.
The next whitewash through is big and powerful enough to drag the board, the body, and us four hangers-on all the way back to the shore.
The three swimmers - and one other bloke from the gathered crowd - grab the limp body, arms and legs - a man to a limb - and unceremoniously haul him, face down, up the beach.
*It’s done.*
I take my time to slowly carry the surfboard up to the dry sand before I put it down and tear the leg rope off my wrist. It’s bizarre - and even while I’m doing it I’m reflecting on how weird an act it is - but we wouldn’t want a wave to come and wash the board away now, would we?
*Am I out of my mind??*
The guys have been smart enough to think the same way about the body, and they’ve run it all the way up the beach and dumped it face first into the dry sand. They roll it over onto its back as I come over.
There's a massive mob gathered. Everyone is losing their shit. Women are wailing, men are yelling, everyone’s making a huge racket.
I push my way to the front row.
The eyes are half open, half closed, and all whites. A bit foamy around the mouth too.
No one’s doing anything. There are a few people kneeling about him, giving him a bit of a shake. *That's it...*
There’s gotta be a doctor in amongst all those tourists at the bar, *surely*, or at least someone in medicine, or *something*. Some sort of professional. Someone *qualified...*
And there’s no way that they could have missed this hoopla...
I get on my knees.
Righto... Fuck. I know first aid - I’ve been trained, *sort of*... That was a while ago. *Years* ago, even.
Better than nothing... It’s not like I can make it any worse than it is, can I?
Ok. Ok, ok, ok. Here we go. "DR ABC". Those are the letters to follow...
Ok.
"D"...
*What the fuck does "D" stand for??*
*Fuck!!*
Dee... Dee dee dee dee...
Danger! *Yes!!*
No. No Danger. *Good.* Move on.
"R", is... *Resuscitation...?*
What the *fuck* does that mean?? Resuscitation??
What am I supposed to do for that??
"*Response!!*"
"R" is Response!
Shake him, *right?* Get a Response. Yes. No - they’ve been shaking him already... So...
I wind up a trembling hand and give him a massive, adrenaline-fuelled bitch slap right across the face. Damn near rip his head off; my fingers fucking hurt.
The gathered mob has been looking at me for cues on how to assist. Without my say-so they start laying into the guy, belting the shit out him. *Fists* come in from everywhere. Everyone’s taking their chance to do their bit and sock him one. I'm *shrieking.* Some silly dickhead down the end starts punching him in the thigh over and over, giving him a dead leg. Dumb fuck. While some other bloke’s sunk the boot in a couple of times before they finally hear me over the din, and give it a rest.
*Fuck’s sake.* It’s gone from resuscitation to mugging...
The pummelling’s had no effect. I was hoping - *really* hoping - he'd just wake up.
"A". Airways.
Yes. Right...
*Ummm...*
Airways. That means making sure he hasn’t chundered. Right? Or swallowed his tongue?
I grab his face with my hand and squeeze, like I'm trying to get a stick off a dog. I’m trying to pull his jaw down with my other hand at the same time, but it’s not loose. It won’t come apart. His skin just moves, the teeth wont. The bastard is locked up *tight*.
I try to put my fingers in between his teeth to pull it apart.
Clamped shut.
I wiggle a little bit of my fingers in the gap of his overbite - just enough to get a purchase - and pull like hell. It gives. *Just* enough room to fit my other fingers in. I’ve gotta strain to pull his teeth apart; I’m using so much force I’m waiting for his bottom jaw to just snap right off.
First a beating, then a broken jaw. Fucking *brutal*.
I take a close look around inside his mouth.
*Foamy.*
No vom. And the tongue is where it ought to be.
*Good.*
D.R. A. "B"...
*Breathing!* How do I check that??
His chest. If it’s moving up and down, that’d be it. *Right?*
Everyone else is still shaking him. I don't think I'd be able to tell one way or the other. It's too subtle...
I stick my ear down to his mouth and nose - and listen.
That’s *retarded.*
I can’t hear myself *think* over this fucking din - let alone listen out for something as light as the breath of a body...
Fog a spoon?
*Fuck off.*
*Panic.* More adrenaline.
*I don't know how to do B*.
Can I skip it?
Wait... Is the “mouth to mouth” bit supposed to be part of “B” or “C”?
What does it matter?? Gotta do it.
C. Circulation. Last thing.
It’d be fucking *ideal* if someone wanted to part the crowd right about now and say “Stand back! I’m a *doctor!* I'll take it from here!”
Fuck. I’m kneeling over him and just shaking out my fingers by my sides like a fucking dandy.
*Did it have to be a bloke?*
Any fucking time now...!
*OK! Here we go!!*
I grab his jaw, I put my mouth wide over his open mouth, make the seal, and blow.
*Fooomp!*
A big glob of snot comes flying out of his nose and sprays all over my cheek.
Fuck! *Fuck fuck fuck!*
*Godfuckingdamnthisshit.*
I can’t *think*!
Right. *Fuck!* Try again.
This time block that *goddamn* nose.
Someone next to me is very close and is yelling something in my ear. I’ve got my fingers pinching his nose and my other hand holding his jaw open as I turn my head to look.
It’s a white girl, about my age.
She says something in English. Even though I’m looking right at her I can’t register it. It’s too loud. And I’m not *really* listening. I’m not even really *here*... It’s all too much.
“What?!”
“You need to check the pulse!”
“*What???*”
“Have you checked the pulse?!” 
“The pulse?!” I look back at the body.
Fuck. *Have I missed a step?*
Does it even matter right now?
Fuck the pulse. I turn back to her, “Who the fuck are you?! Are you a fucking doctor??”
“Yes!!”
Wait...
“*WHAT?!*” I stare at her and she just stares right back at me.
*“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??”*
I look back at the body, then back to her. She doesn’t make a move to take over, she just kneels there in the sand, jibbering about the pulse...
Bugger it. Where was I? *Right.*
I blow, again. No snot. He makes a sound like an air mattress being blown up. I can see from the corner my eye his chest inflate and rise up a surprisingly high amount. *It's working.*
Good! Excellent! Progress!
I remember this now: two of those breaths, then thirty pushes on the chest - two every second - count to fifteen as you go. Try to crack ribs, that means you're doing it right. I *remember* this...
Ok!
Two pumps to each count...
*One.. Two.. Three.. Four..*
*Everyone* tries to help. *Again.* Everyone within reach is mimicking me. The trouble is that they’re doing it everywhere. *All over*. Someone’s shoving him in the guts, someone’s shoving him in the side, someone’s doing it on the other side of his chest, out of sync with me. That dumb fuck down the end starts doing compressions on his leg.
*This isn’t real.*
I scream at them to stop it. I shriek it at the top of my lungs. *They're fucking it up.*
But the mob has reached fever pitch. Either they can’t hear me or everyone’s as desperate and freaked out as I am. They’ve all stopped listening to me. I shove one guy off, then another. In the time that I’ve shoved the second bloke off the first one’s gone back to mashing his guts again.
Nothing for it. *Hopeless.*
I sit back.
The body is jiggling and wobbling around like jelly with everyone’s pushing. It all looks a little crook.
*What to do now?*
Fuck it; might as well keep going till the ambulance gets here.
Wait. Is an ambulance even coming?? Surely someone's made a call... Do they even *have* ambulances here??
In any case, there's no point in stopping what I'm doing...
Another two breaths in, and I start the compressions again.
I’m looking from his face to his chest, from his chest to his face as I go, and his half open mouth suddenly wells up with water and starts spilling over his cheeks like a blocked up laundry sink.
*"Whoa!!"*
I flip him onto his side like I’m flipping a table.
Water comes *pouring* out of his mouth. *A lot of it*. There are chunks of pink stuff in it. What the fuck is the pink stuff?? Chunks of *lung??*
I roll him onto his back when it’s stopped flowing out.
Is he breathing? I put my ear to his mouth again. I can't tell shit... I think we've just plunger'd him.
*Dunno.*
The crowd is going mental. Everyone’s screaming.
I give him two more breaths. I go to work on his chest again.
He starts doing little convulsions in his guts - I can *see* it flex - even with everyone shoving him all over.
This is *definitely* him...
I flip him onto his side again and he convulses, a big one, and noiselessly brings up a heap of water. He pipes a half bucket of seawater out onto the sand, relaxes, then convulses again and brings up the other half.
More water than you’d think possible.
More chunky pink bits.
He starts making noises like he’s got machine gun hiccups.
*Everyone* loses their shit. It’s panda-fucking-monium.
I leave him on his side. The "recovery position".
I lean over him and look at his face.
His eyes are open. Bulging *way* out of his head and bloodshot to hell. Like a fish brought up from deep water; his eyes look like they’re about to pop right out of his head.
They’re not blinking, they’re not moving, just staring, fixedly, at nothing.
Jeeeeeesus. H. *Christ.*
*Is he alive??*
I can’t tell... I can’t tell if the hiccuping is really, *really* shallow breathing, or just convulsions that are getting no air in.
I stick my ear next to his face again but the crowd has gone totally deafening, It’s impossible to know whether he's breathing for himself or not.
People are trying to push him out of the "recovery positions" and onto his back. This time I’m having none of it. I'm ready to punch someone in the face. They stop pushing.
I bend over him again, real close, and he’s breathing. *Tiny* little gasping breaths, but it’s definitely getting into him.
I’m looking right at his eyes, I try to talk to him and get a reaction. He’s not looking back. He’s still got that far-off, wide-eyed stare.
His eyes are so far out of his skull that it looks cartoonish; it looks broken.
Too late?
Braindead?
Alive, at least. On a knife's edge... but alive.
*Ambulance time.*
I scream up at the mob to "call a fucking ambulance" but no one’s listening to me; they're too busy losing their minds.
No one’s giving me the green light that an ambo is on the way, or exactly what the fuck the plan is now...
It’s making me furious.
I pick out a tourist in the crowd, lock eyes with the guy, point at him and scream at him to get an ambulance.
Off he runs.
*Good.*
Back to the dead guy. He's still hiccuping away. He doesn’t look conscious, but I tell him that he’s ok and that help is coming anyway, and tell him to try to breathe a little deeper.
*No response.*
The chief muggers have decided that now is the time to get him off the beach.
They start to grab limbs and pick him up.
I'm having none of it; This bloke looks right on the edge of the living and the dead, I reckon if they shift him he could easily stop breathing again and die anyway. He shouldn't move an inch till he’s at least blinking again, or breathing something close to normal, or till an ambo comes...
I yell at them to leave him where he is.
They yell back.
It's a shouting contest, they're giving me full beans.
I’m upto my gills in adrenaline. I shriek right back at them.
*I'm going to punch someone...*
Then it all snaps.
All the adrenaline blows up and I'm suddenly knackered.
I melt into a pile and sit back on my haunches.
*Fine.* It's someone else’s problem now...
They drag him off; a man to a limb again; face down, again; running, ungraceful and uncaring. *He looks dead.*
Poor bastard's gonna die twice in a day.
*I feel sick.*
---
His name is Richard.
He's alive.
Not brain dead or anything.
He's KO’d in a hospital bed; a pretty shitty hospital bed.
His only complaints - back when he was briefly conscious - were that his stomach and legs were really, *really* sore. Of course he couldn't join the dots as to why drowning would make his legs hurt so much. Clearly no one's filled him in yet on the mugging...
I'm getting this intel from his mates; the gutsy three who came in the other way when I was heading back to shore. 
*He can’t swim.*
Not even a little bit.
His mates can’t swim either; despite them being fucking *fishermen* for a living.
Seems crazy to me.
Apparently; people drown here on the coast all the time.
And despite their predisposition to sinking like rocks, they all hang out down at the beach, and just fuck about in the shallows.
Which is just plain thick, I reckon.
A big wave comes in - takes everyone by surprise - and whips someone out of the shallows, off their feet and into the waves. Their mates - who also can’t swim - can only watch as their mate drowns. Powerless to help.
Fucking *awful*.
And that's just what happened to Richard.
---
I head back to the "beach resort", and I'm treated like a hero by anyone who saw the thing.
Being hugged by people I don’t know and getting quite a few free drinks. *A lot* of free drinks, in fact.
It’s all bullshit; I know the score. Piss weak cowardice followed by the worst, most botched successful resuscitation in the history of resuscitations.
Richard wasn't the only bloke who was very lucky today. In the same grain of pure selfishness I’d exercised at the time, I shock myself again by feeling happier that he’d lived for the sake of my own conscience rather than rejoicing that he survived for his own sake.
*Luck* is the only reason that I get to be ok with this.
It seems a hollow victory; a different roll of the dice and this could have been a fucking *wake*. Should have been, in fact... All things considered...
All that I thought I was by doing this trip - brave, courageous, tough - has been revealed, at it's very depths, to be selfishness and vanity.
It's redefined me.
It feels ugly.
It’s grating on me a bit that everyone’s making out like I’m the white knight of the story.
But if they want to buy me a drink, hey, I’m not about to refuse...
---
I end the night just like Richard; bringing up a big bucket load of fluid with my eyes popping out of my head whilst lying on the sandy floor of the beach.
History, delightfully, repeating.

## Chapter Twenty Four
Cape Coast is fucking awesome.
The only touristy place I’ve seen since crossing the Sahara.
Since the carnage of day one I've been content in living the beach life.
The “resort” itself is the jewel in the crown. A sprawling hotel built from thatched huts, run by a young, humourless German.
It's filthy cheap, with decent dorms costing 7 bucks a night and good hammocks strung up between every palm tree.
There's a great bar, a free surfboard, and the heaviest showers I’ve ever stood under.
To top it all off there's nowhere in the place that you can't see the beach, or hear it; when you wake up, when you fall asleep, and all the time in between, you hear the ocean.
The joint is packed full of European backpackers, twenty-something's, all here to "rough it" in Ghana, and to do their bit of good. The so-called "voluntourists".
And after the last few months of seeing very little other than black everything - with the occasional rough looking white bloke - a blonde woman becomes quite the striking novelty.
The place is crawling with them. Most of them are either German or Danish.
Ghana seems to be a bit of a soft landing for them, as far as West Africa locations go: English as the spoken language, relative stability, security, and what you might call prosperity. That combination, it would seem, is enough to make it the go-to place for these Europeans.
The "least worst" option, if you like...
An oasis in the middle of West Africa.
By streets it’s my favourite place I’ve stayed in so far on the continent. The small luxuries here stand out like diamonds in the rough.
---
I spend two weeks. And reflect.
Here's a taste:
"I wonder why it is that I’m afraid of doing all of the things that I love doing most?
Running, surfing, diving, riding, basketball, even learning French...
They all hold a fear and anxiety before I begin them. But once I get going, I love them.
Why is that?
Is the fear the cause and pleasure the effect? What’s the relationship? Something to do with being outside of your comfort zone?
I need to push myself harder. I’m at risk of becoming soft - if I haven’t already. I'm at risk of letting fear dictate what I do and do not do.
I need to push myself. I need to be my own hero."
That, it turns out, is the exact problem with Cape Coast. Its comfortable softness is starting to make me soft. The lack of motivation is making me super lazy, and the laziness is paving the way towards depression: Waking up sometime in the afternoon, because you don’t have a watch, and then having nothing to do for the rest of the afternoon might *sound* like luxury - and sure, it is... - but you can have too much of a good thing, and it's not good for me.
Show me infinite time and I’ll show you zero motivation.
This was supposed to be an adventure; a challenge. I was supposed to be learning things - deep and profound and personal.
The most adventurous thing I’ve done in weeks is learn that fresh pineapple is amazing in muesli...
When I haven't been gorging on pineapples, I’ve been shitting my pants over Nigeria. In fact, I’ve been shitting my pants about Nigeria the entire journey; but now, shit’s getting real.
What was once something I could deal with in the future is now very much sitting just over the horizon; two tiny little countries away to the east; a clusterfuck waiting to happen.
Nigeria’s not the only thing sitting on the horizon that’s giving me the willies. Winter is coming. Well, maybe not winter, but the wet season undoubtedly is.
No question.
When it’s not bright and sunny and hot as fuck here it’s bucketing down lukewarm, torrential, tropical rain. Pissing it. Rain so thick you can’t see through it, turning the streets and gutters into rivers in mere minutes.
Both Nigeria and The Wet are ominous as fuck.
I don't want my bike dying in either...
I’m not sure which one I’d prefer least. The idea of a simple mechanical failure somewhere in the middle of Nigeria, in the pissing rain, with the sun setting, freaks me right the fuck out.
It’s pushed me to try to get the bike serviced and in tip top shape before I leave Ghana. And Cape Coast seemed the ideal place to do it.
But, nothing ever seems to come easy, even here in Ghana; half the parts that I had FedEx'd across from Europe to do the job got detained by Customs in a place called Accra, Ghana's capital.
According to "Priscilla" at FedEx, the Ghana Customs want 150 bucks worth of "duty costs" to release the package - the value of the stuff inside the package is only worth 200 clams itself...
I smell bullshit.
I had to buy a phone - against my will - and break that solemn, drunken oath I’d sworn back in Barcelona to *not* do so until I was "lying on the floor in the fetal position, crying for want of a phone".
Anyway. I ended up hurling abuse down my new (old) Nokia brick at my mate Priscilla, for about an hour each day, for *days*, trying to get her to do her bloody job and get the package released, or at least explain to me how the fuck they justify charging a 75% customs duty when the other package, nearly identical, came through without being charged a single cedi.
Despite being an assertive bastard these days it’s still nothing doing, other than making Priscilla very upset.
Stupid African bureaucracy crap.
Fucking incompetence.
So it's time to go give Priscilla a piece of my mind, in the flesh.
---
My poor bike...
It's been gently encrusted with ocean spray for three hundred and thirty six hours straight. The less noble metals have rusted out something fierce. The bike’s gone from looking "like lamb dressed as mutton", clean through the "vintage" phase, and over into the "rusted bucket of shit" column.
Not too happy with that...
*Time to go...*
---
I peel out.
I never saw Richard conscious; even though it's been weeks...

## Chapter Twenty Five
Accra.
The capital.
Smells vaguely of stale piss.
But I like it. Couldn’t say why – it sure ain’t the fragrance - but over the last few days I've felt at ease here.
Maybe it's "Porschia", the girl who sells me my rice and fried chicken lunch and dinner everyday...
Porschia is *ridiculous.* Her and Fatu from Senegal (remember her?) could have a death-match over who is the biggest bombshell in West Africa. It'd end in a tie... Porschia is another one of these freaks of nature; one of these girls where you just shake your head with a smile and say "well that's just *stupid*".
Which makes this next bit funny: I *know* the glad-eye when I see it, and Porschia has been *pouring* it on; she even took time out of her shift to watch me shove fried chicken into my face. *That* keen. And I don't know why; I don't get it; it really makes no sense...
I've *become* the intrepid destitute; I *am* Marco Polo's arsehole. That's *me*; the homeless looking guy on the park bench watching the ducks from what feels like lifetimes ago.
Put simply; I look rough as guts.
Yet I feel like at any second she'll vault over the table, slap the chicken out of my mouth and *ravage* me.
It's almost frightening levels of glad-eye.
I'm *suspicious* even; *what's in it for her??* She can't possibly be in it for the looks. And I doubt it's my sparkling personality...
And so, for reasons that even I don't understand, instead of fanning the flames I hose them down.
I can almost *hear* the collective groan of all of my mates: *"What the fuck are you doing??"*
---
Moving right along...
It turns out that I can do what the plebs at FedEx can’t do; I’m in and out of the Customs building with my parts - and not a cedi spent - within *fifteen minutes*.
It’s bitter sweet; I’m happy to have the parts and proud that I could get it done myself, but at the same time I want to shove them up Priscilla’s arse.
Useless *fuck.*
I get a good, healthy dose of perspective on the way out when I hear the news that Boko Haram – a terrorist group in Nigeria – has just bombed the Nigerian capital of Abuja and killed 88 people.
*Fuck.*
Cue the worried messages from family back home.
Better get the bike into some *seriously* good nick...
---
After a day of hard looking I manage to find a proper, legit, modern garage.
Through some sweet talking I convince them to lend me one of their motorbike hoists for a couple of days as well as free reign of the workshop.
It’s filthy, *reeking* hot outside, and in this metal death-box - without a hint of a whiff of wind - it’s *beyond*.
It’s so hot in here I can feel the heat in my *eyeballs*.
I get cracking.
The whole bike slowly comes apart, stuff gets tinkered with, cleaned, looked at, shoulders are shrugged, stuff is put back, stuff is swapped, stuff is replaced.
Anything that’s not covered in oil gets covered in my sweat. Lots of both. It's a greasy, sweaty hot mess. My clothes are all soaked through. The sweat drips off the end of my nose like the beat of a metronome.
There’s an exhausted, grimy grin on my face.
It’s incredibly satisfying stuff; doing an honest day’s work with your hands. I get to stand back at the end of the day and say "There it is... Today, I’ve achieved *this*."
I reckon that’s what was missing in the old desk job. The *realness*; clearing an "AC15 assurance milestone" on a multi-billion-dollar project isn’t anywhere near as satisfying as changing a spark plug.
---
It takes me two full days of sweat and work.
I finish satisfied; I ride out *thrilled*: the bike has *never* ridden better. It's never felt more powerful, never *sounded* better.
I’m grinning like a simpleton as I give it the beans.
Two days work; job well done.
---
Boko Haram have now kidnapped three hundred school girls from a village called Chibok. It makes worldwide headlines.
If I wasn’t freaked out about Nigeria before, I sure as shit am now.
And the family back home are managing to be even more freaked out than I am; if that’s even possible.
I have one last chicken with Porschia and peel out of Accra.
I head for the hills.

## Chapter Twenty Six
*Wli* is something of a gem.
A tiny village in the "Volta region", with a decent waterfall close-by and a glorious, trek to the “upper falls”.
The hiking track is a well beaten one, not too technical, but enough to keep you on your toes, and steep enough to get me drenched in sweat in the baking humidity; it feels like I'm in a yum-cha steamer, and the track feels like it just keeps going and going...
It’s wonderful to be outside, free and alone in nature again. The forest is full of trees, and the trees are full of creepers, and that means a dense, closed-in green everywhere you look. The ground around my knees is thick with butterflies, bringing their own dancing colour to the show, and once every now and again you get a little peek through the canopy above to see the waterfall, and a peek through the canopy below to tiny *Wli*, way off in the distance.
A truly beautiful part of the world, and I have it all to myself.
For a time...
I cross a group of white, sweaty, flustered, tourists coming back down the mountain, being led on by a local. When the guide spots me - gallivanting around by myself - I get stopped and asked where my guide is. There’s a fair bit of anger and shock when I reply that I don’t have a guide. I'm told that it's against the rules and that I *need* to come back down the mountain with them.
*I don’t think I will, thanks.*
This is nature, for fuck's sake; not a theme park. Much of my enjoyment is coming from the solitude and freedom in this beautiful place; of doing it alone, and seeing these groups of tourists is already cheapening it enough for me without having some "guide" along.
I wish them a nice day, and crack on.
*Fuck ‘em.*
---
I pass about three or four groups in the two hours or so it takes me to get to the top, each guide getting more and more shirty at me, so much so that in the end, when I get asked “Where is your guide??” I tell him “he’s right behind me...” and keep going on.
When I finally get to the foot of the "upper falls” - the end of the line - there are a group of tourists mucking around in the pool at the bottom of the waterfall.
It’s a bit of a bummer not to have the whole place to myself, but it’s a nice enough spot to sit down and soak up the serenity.
I take a long, deep breath. Life is *good*.
A young local bloke comes storming up to me, he’s really, *really* pissed off, and I can sense in the way he's marching over that he’s been waiting for me...
He stands right over me, *crazy eyed*, right in the way of the waterfall.
“You! Where is your guide?!”
“Hi! What’s your name?” I hold out my hand from my sitting position.
“My name?? My name is Wisdom!” That's a bit odd... “Where is your guide!?”
“Wisdom? That’s an interesting name. Nice to meet you Wisdom.” We shake hands, but it doesn’t shake off any of the vitriol. “Beautiful day today don’t you think?”
“Where is your guide!?”
“I don’t have one.”
“Illegal!! This is illegal! You have no permission! You must pay!”
“Of course. No problem.”
“Yes, good, you pay me now.”
“No, no. That’s ok. Thanks. I’ll pay back at the bottom.”
"No, you must pay *now!!*"
“No, but thank you, I’ll pay at the bottom.”
"It's illegal!! You pay now!"
We go in circles, in varying words, on the same theme, with elevating volume..
On the fifth go of the merry-go-round something snaps in him, like, *really* snaps. He flies into a *rage* and then stalks off.
I finally get to enjoy the waterfalls...
Nope.
*Here he comes again...*
He gets right in my face. “Is it true that you don’t have a guide?”
What?
That’s an odd question...
Ah! I see... he’s got his phone out, and he’s trying to subtly record the conversation. Silly dickhead. Trying to trap me with an admission of guilt.
I won’t play his game.
Fuck you, Wisdom.
“I’m just trying to enjoy the waterfalls, thanks.” And a smile.
"Do you have a guide!?"
“I’m just enjoying the waterfalls, thanks.”
He goes *wild*.
“I have the *right!* by *principle!* to search your bag! By *principle!*”
What’s the bag got to do with it?
“No, you have no right. It’s not happening.”
“You will pay a penalty! *Three times double!!*”
“What? No I won’t.” Peanut.
He goes off. Completely crazy. Ranting shit I don’t understand, and I get the feeling that this is going to come to blows pretty soon if I don’t pay him.
I capitulate.
Fifteen cedi’s. Six bucks fifty, just to walk in nature.
What is the world coming to?

## Chapter Twenty Seven
I’m woken at dawn by every fucking rooster in the village having a cocker-doodle-doo off.
*Dripping dread.*
Must be a border day...
Togo.
Tiny, but a scary country none-the-less. It’s the birth place of black magic and voodoo and all the rest of that weird shit. I’ve been told by a few people that my ears will be valuable there - *very* valuable - so I should be careful.
*Sounds great.*
---
*Wli* is right on the border; the border post itself is just a short ride up the road.
I head straight to Immigration, get immediately stamped out.
The only hassle I cop is a friendly point at the bike from one of the Immigration guys saying “you give me this motorbike”.
Easy peasy, Japanesey.
On the Togo side of the border, getting the passport stamped is equally easy. There's no Douanes though (yep, back to French), and the cops who are doing the job of Immigration direct me ten clicks down the road to a village named “Ndigbe” where I can get some papers for my bike.
---
The middle aged bloke manning the post will issue me an LP for 6,000 CFA. Fifteen-ish dollars.
*Deal.*
When I give him a 10,000CFA note he - of course - doesn’t have change. No doubt in the hope I’ll leave him with a creamy 4k.
Nope.
So to break the deadlock we head to the “bijouterie” - which I imagine is French for a "corner store".
On the way he asks if I can buy him a water. *Sure.* Why not?
We get to the store and I buy a couple of big bottles of water to crack the ten. The lady only has one bottle, and while she’s running off to grab another my mate casually reaches into the fridge, grabs a beer, cracks it, and starts pouring it out into a glass.
*It's 10 in the morning...*
I see what he’s getting at...
“voo meh ashtray”. *You buy me*. Great.
“Non non, shae voo ashtray de low”. *No no, I buy you water.*
“Say le mem”. *It’s the same.*
“Snay par. Par la mem shos. Voo ashtray.” *It’s not. Not the same thing. You pay.*
To his credit he doesn’t fight me.
The woman comes back with the change, I give him his 6,000 and head off.
Into Togo.
Cool.
---
I’m stopped almost immediately at a roped checkpoint, manned by three cops. There's no way past.
*Great.*
I pull up and shake hands, not stopping the motor, nor getting off the bike, nor taking the helmet off.
One of the cops does a lap of the bike, and I can hear him over the motor, standing behind me, making a big deal about the UK number plates, and how I can’t come in without Togolese number plates.
*Ridiculous.*
I ignore it and hope he’ll let it go.
He comes around in front of my face and says that the bike’s no good without Togo plates.
I pretend that I don’t really cog what he’s told me. Instead, I turn off the bike, get off, and de-helmet. I’m *melting* in this leather jacket.
I take the initiative back and run the normal distraction tactics of asking for directions.
They answer the question with the obvious answer; there’s practically only one road in this country, so that’s their recommendation.
The ruse hasn’t worked, I can tell they want to get back to the number plates.
“Bar bar bar bar *Onglatear*...”, which means "something something something something *England...*"
I cut him off right there. “Wee! Exactament, Onglatear. Jevay par: Onglatear, Esscoss, France, Belgie, Suisse, Italia, Espagne...” I proceed to rattle off the whole list onto my fingers, not leaving out the smaller countries - like Andorra - or the countries that I spent an hour in - like Italy – or the countries that aren’t recognised as legitimate by everyone – like Western Sahara - and the list has become quite a big one. *Twenty* in all. And I take my glorious time to sound them all off. I finish with a jazz hands: “tout par cet moto!!” *All with this motorbike*.
No one say's boo about the plates being illegal after that...
Fuckin' *boom*.
They ask for my papers, and they get the usual treatment of only getting what they ask for, but they end up wheedling out of me the whole gamut. *Everything.* All of my papers are out and everything is being checked and re-checked, right down making sure the frame number, all seventeen digits of it, match what’s written in the registration papers.
Blokes like this are mugs.
While they're looking about for more stuff to try to hang me on, I’m putting my helmet back on and starting the ignition. No one’s given me permission to go, but they get the hint that their time's up and give me my papers back and lift the rope.
I'm not fucking about these days...
*Off we go.*

## Chapter Twenty Eight
Lomé.
I don’t reckon I’ve ever had a better first impression of an African city.
*Big call.*
It's a small city, built on the coast, yet modernish. A tidy city.
Cheap Chinese motorbikes dominate this place in massive packs, with forty to fifty all creeping to the space in front of the cars at the traffic lights (traffic lights!!), and they swarm away like a hive of angry bees on green. It’s awesome to be part of the pack, and I ride about town just for the fun of it.
*Street food is back.* Hallelujah. Walking the streets after dark, I'm well and truly spoilt for choice. Lots of decent food at a decent price. Lomé's got it in spades.
The streets teem with the sound and colour of people looking for a feed. The place has a real *vitality* to it. There are smiling, colourful, big mammas everywhere, selling the good stuff to the clientele sitting on their wooden benches, bowl in hand.
The scale is serious; the steaming drum of rice is too big to hug your arms around, and yet it disappears. *Fast.* Such is the turnover.
There are huge pots, up to ten of them - the biggest pots you’d have in your kitchen - all filled with mysterious, steamy sauces with meats and vegetables and who-knows-what.
It’s all shades of brown and green.
The trick is not to ask what it is, or even to think too much about what to choose. Just stick to whatever is popular with everyone else, never mind how it looks; it’ll be fuckin' delicious.
It’s still customary to go back for seconds of the sauce with your left over rice - at no extra charge, of course.
Fuck I love this.
Just never mind the fact that the bowl and spoon you're eating with has been fished out of a tub of barely-soapy brown water... Ignore that.
More food than you can eat for just under a dollar.
I stuff my face with it while having friendly conversation with the locals. Different language, same question: “You like this food, hey?”
Yes. Yes I do. Very much so.
If that doesn’t take your fancy there are big avocado/guacamole and kidney bean sandwiches in French baguettes, heavily salted - which might not sound great, but trust me, it’s delicious. Crazy good.
It’s all washed down with mangoes and pineapples and powdered coffee with condensed milk from vendors on wheels for around 20 cents each.
*Outstanding.*
I fucking *love* it here.
---
A young local bloke at the hotel reckons I ain't seen nothing yet, reckons he knows the *best* street food joint in town.
His name is Kys. Like, "kiss", but not...
I don't like him.
He's always immaculately dressed in a white shirt and he won't leave me in peace whenever I'm at the hotel; he hangs about me like a bad smell.
Despite him being nothing but friendly there’s just something about him that gets my back up. Sets me on edge.
I've been giving him smokebombs for days, but he’s nothing if not persistent and eventually I have to cave in against my will and accept his invitation to dinner.
We head off into the dark.
Instead of heading straight out to the main street he takes me on an unnecessary detour down an unlit, tight alleyway.
My eyes take an age to adjust after the bright lights of the main street.
And then I can see...
The alleyway is *full* of prostitutes.
*Choc full.*
I *know* they're prostitutes; for one there’s the dress code... and they stand in their door frames in a way that only a hooker can.
Every eye is on me as we walk through. Burning holes in me.
I’m trying to casually keep on with conversation to Kys about the football, but my mind and my eyes are whizzing about, looking out for danger from somewhere.
My wrist gets *latched* onto by a fucking claw and a woman screams “whiteman!!” right behind me, right in my ear.
I spin and wrench my arm off whatever’s got hold of it, ready to start swinging limbs and screaming and running all at once.
My attacker is a sequined prozzie. Scared the *shit* out of me. She’s got a look on her face like I just somehow offended *her*.
*Fuck you.* Fuck this. Fuck Kys. *Get me out of here.*
I’ve gotta give more credit to my instincts...
Wait... *Why is she speaking English??*

## Chapter Twenty Nine
Hold your breath; I need to talk about visas, and it's messy.
So.
There’s no "diplomatic mission" for Benin - the next stop down the line - here in Lomé; neither Embassy nor Consulate.
*That could be a problem;* without a visa there’s nowhere else to go except Burkina Faso to the north, followed by Chad followed by northern Nigeria. That's a shit option, the kind of shit option that’ll put a dent in your day, and maybe another one in your head...
I’ve assumed that - like everywhere else - there would be a diplomatic mission of some description in the country next door. It makes sense; you want to have an embassy for your neighbours, y'know, for diplomacy.
And it's *always* been like that. But not here... Fuck it.
So that's one drama. The next one is that the only country down the line that I have a visa for is Nigeria, which comes right after Benin. And because there's no Embassy for the country after Nigeria (which would be Cameroon) here in Togo, that means I'll have to get *that* visa *in* Nigeria, and waiting in Nigeria for visas - with the added chance of being rejected and therefore stranded - isn’t my idea of a good time.
But here's the rub: *I don't really have a choice.*
Well I sort of do; there *is* the possibility of getting transit visas...
Transit visas are just that; visas that let you transit a country, and no more. They're normally valid for only a couple of days; just enough time to get from one end of the country to the other. They're measured in *hours.* And they're not a sure thing; I'd be at the discretion of the border goobers after I've already immigrated *out* of the country I'm coming from.
Could be a fucking shitshow.
Yet, for Benin - with no embassy here - it's my only shot at getting in...
In case things weren't rosy enough, there's another problem: Gabon - the next country along the line from Cameroon - is *notoriously* difficult to get into; they just *don't* give out visas.
All this has killed my appetite for doing shit at the last minute, so I've decided to get as much of my shit in a pile when I can. And right now that means hitting up the Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo embassies here in Togo, even if those two countries are fucking *miles* down the line.
So there you have it; the joys of overlanding.
---
*What a pain in the dick!*
I *finally* walk up to the gates of the Gabon Embassy, *way* out of town. Took me three hours to find the bastard. Like a deaf person playing "Marco Polo", the directions from these locals are *worse* than useless.
*But I'm here.*
The security guard stops me at the big steel door in the big concrete wall.
"Non," he points at my feet, shakes his head "non."
*Won't let me in without shoes...*
*I'm gonna blow...*
---
There and back again and there again.
A hundred and twenty dollars for a stamped bit of sticker in the passport.
No references.
No supporting documentation.
No having to make up lies.
*I'd make that deal.*
Gabon: done!
---
Next: the Democratic Republic of Congo (or DRC for short).
I’ve heard that getting into DRC is a crapshoot at the moment; travellers getting turned back at the border, even though they have a proper visa and everything.
Apparently the rub is that the visa *must* match the travellers country of residence. Why? Fuck knows...
That'd mean having to fly home if I was going to do this properly.
Or...
I could just pretend I'm a resident of Togo...
I don't *look* like a resident of Togo...
Might as well have a crack. Can’t hurt to try...
---
Another morning fucking lost on a fucking goose chase through fucking Lomé.
Deadset sick of this shit.
Immigration. I've made it. Finally.
Had to come here anyway; the clock is ticking on my Togo visa, so I've got to get that sucker extended. Figure I can get two birds with one stone; visa extension plus residency permit.
I barge in. The joint's packed.
I get handballed from one official to another to another to another...
My French is fucking *useless*.
I'm finally informed that I never needed to extend the visa, as the clock only started ticking on it when I stamped in at the border, not when I was issued it. I'm not convinced... The fact that the dopey bastards keep pointing at my Ivory Coast visa like it's my Togo visa doesn't inspire confidence.
They don't have anything to do with residency either; for that I'll need to talk to the cops.
In other words, I've burnt another fucking day for nothing...
---
The cop shop.
I walked all over town looking for the fucking thing when it was on the same fucking street as my fucking hotel.
I've fucking had it with this shit.
I can *see* my hotel from here, for fuck's sake.
I get stopped at the gates at the front by a bunch of grunts lazing about with big guns. Folks are coming and going all the time but *I* get stopped.
I tell them I'm here to pick up a "permit de residence".
*Come right in...*
One of the grunts who's taken me under his wing wants a copy of my passport page, my address, and my mum and dad's names.
*That’s it?*
Oh, no, he wants cash. Of course. 8,500 CFA. Twenty-ish bucks. Which is actually quite a bit. It’s obvious that this isn’t going to be done “on the record”.
*Fine by me.*
---
I head back there after the prescribed three hours and - *there it is* - my official, stamped and sealed Togolese residency permit.
I’m now a permanent resident of Togo. I have the paper to prove it.
That was *way* too easy.
I make the rookie error of not bringing correct change, and end up having to part with 10,000 CFA, but I don’t really care, and don’t exactly want to make a fuss with the cops about getting change back for a bribe on an ill-gotten residency permit.
So, *that* now opens the doors for that DRC visa.
*Excellent.*
---
In my dreams I'm carefree. Happy.
Sleep is my happy place.
I cling to sleep as I sense it slipping away from me - all too soon.
My eyes unwillingly open a crack, and I can’t place where I am. Groggy. Confused for a split second.
Then I see the familiar mosquito net that looks like a prop from a D grade slasher movie, covered in streaks of mosquito blood; the spinning, wobbling fan; the peeling paint and the smashed window. And the dream vanishes and reality becomes clear, and hot on its heels comes a sense of foreboding, dripping dread. That grips me and crushes me from the instant my conscious mind starts turning the cogs - before I’ve moved my head even a smidgen on the greasy pillow.
*Another day.*
I don’t want to get out of bed. I never do.
I’ve gone from feeling liberated by Africa to feeling imprisoned by it, entrapped by it.
It’s been a nothing seven days. Every day; lugubrious, sedentary living. So depressing. Seven days in Lome is many too many.
The next stretch, in terms of both my safety and of the shit I’ll have to come up against absolutely terrifies me. The danger, the arguments, the conflicts, *the confrontation.*
JB's not going to make it before I hit Nigeria. It's going to have to be me. Solo.
I'm not sure I can...
I haul my arse out of bed and fetch food.
---
I watch the planes fly overhead with envy as I eat my breakfast of hot rice and beans and pasta. I wish I could get on a plane and leave. I’m tired. Dirty and grimy, sweaty and tired. But the option of going home isn’t an option at all. Never has been. Never going to happen. I couldn’t do it.
---
The pleb at the DRC embassy gives me a knowing smile when I pull out the residency permit on request, as if to say "well played".
No other questions asked.
It sets me back around ninety bucks. It's got a wicked kind of embossed finish on the coat of arms, which is a first. A pretty pimpin' visa for a piss poor country.
Nice one, DRC, I’m impressed.
So that’s that *in the can* then. DRC is a long way off but it’s good to feel like I’m making some sort of progress.
But it’s left me with a new problem; that I’ve only got five blank pages left in my passport.
*Not a lot.*
I don't think I can fit ten more countries in there...
While I'm on a roll, I might as well try getting the Angola visa; it's outrageously far down the line, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
---
Heading to the Angola embassy wasn't even worth the effort; they close the door in my face pretty quickly; *the ambassador is out of town.*
Angola, by the way, has *nothing* to do with Genghis Khan. That's *Mongolia*...
Different.

## Chapter Thirty
Off to the Benin border.
No visa, and no idea what’s going to happen...
Time to roll the dice. I’m nervous.
Togo is such a geographically skinny country that a street sign at a roundabout points to the right and says “Frontière Ghana” and points to the left and says “Frontière Benin”.
Whichever way you turn, you end up in a different country.
Left it is.
---
I get out of Togo easily enough. I ask anyone I come across about whether or not I can buy a Benin visa on *this* side of the post, so that I don’t get stuck in limbo between the countries if they reject me.
“Non. Pas ici.” Okay, that’s expected, I guess..
"Eh la cotay Benin?"
“Non. Pas la aussi” What?? I *can't* get one on the other side either??
"Pour-qua?"
“Ce necessare d'allay a Lome.” *Everyone's* been saying that; I can't get it here, and I can't get it on the Benin side either; I have to go back to Lome...
*Fuck.*
I *know* that there’s nothing that I can do back in Lome; they don't have a fucking embassy there...
I’m gonna have to just suck it up and take my medicine...
---
I'm greeted with the Benin flag, and a cop. He stops me and demands my passport. He’s not gonna be happy that there’s no visa... Here we go...
*But no...*
He’s more interested in where I’ve *been*, fingering slowly through my passport, page by page, asking about the countries, always replying with - and I'll skip the French - “On this bike?”
“Yes.”
“Aigh!?”
“Yup”
“This one?”
“Uh huh. This one”
He lands on a new page. “Nigeria!?”
“Yeah”
“On this?!” he points at the bike.
“Yup.” He shakes his hand like he burnt his fingers.
“You need a visa?”
“Erm, yeah, yeah I do.”
“Come.”
---
It's a fucking *breeze.*
Unbelievable.
Transit visa, pasted and stamped. Which now gives me precisely forty eight hours to leave the country again. 10,000 CFA, which is about twenty bucks.
Forty eight hours to Nigeria...
*I should be more careful what I wish for.*
The Douanes didn’t ask me for anything other than the bikes rego to write me up a laissez-passer.
*Love that.*
I skate away into Benin after a pretty well organised border, with 16,000CFA spent – about 33 bucks in all – with full papers.
The whole damn thing was pretty quick and painless; most of the drama was happening between my ears...
I think there’s a lesson in that somewhere...

## Chapter Thirty One
Benin is as much of a midget as Togo – only a hundred clicks wide – so getting across it in a couple a days wasn't a stretch.
In a blink I spent one night in a place called Cotonou, and now I'm Porto Novo, just a short jaunt from the Nigerian border, trying to sleep.
So... Here we are.
*Nigeria.*
The traveller’s nightmare.
The place has been scaring the shit out of me for months now. It's been playing on my mind ever since I decided to have a crack at Africa. And now that it’s finally here I’ve really whipped myself into a special kind of frenzy for this one.
Now, to be fair, I've been mildly scared of every country that I've travelled through. So crapping myself now is nothing new; every single country has been spooky just because it is - at the least - an *unknown*.
But Nigeria takes the cake. Steals the show.
Let me tell you why I can’t sleep.
To safely negotiate Nigeria is like walking a tightrope. If you fuck it up and fall to the north side, you land on those fun Islamist extremists, *the Boko Haram*, who - I’ve found out - have actually killed *thousands* of Christians in the last year.
The kidnapping of the school girls and the bombing of bus stations at the capital that I'd heard about a few weeks back is just a ramp up of what’s been happening for the last five *years*.
*Scary shit.*
According to the Boko Haram, "Western education is the root of all evil". They want to carve out their own country in northern Nigeria that will have *Sharia law*.
Not a fun bunch.
If they’ve been happily massacring their own countrymen it doesn’t take much of an imagination to think of what they’d do if they got their hands on a foreigner like me...
So. Avoid the north...
But if I accidentally stray too far to the south I'm still equally in the shit. On *that* side of the tightrope you have pissed off locals who have had a gutful of Western oil companies polluting their Niger Delta (a “delta” being a huge river system) with big oil spills, and then not cleaning them up.
It's destroying their livelihood, which was primarily fishing.
So, as a new livelihood, they kidnap and ransom the oil workers.
Two birds with one stone, right?
Again, not a fun bunch.
Yet, between these two mutually exclusive yet equally unpleasant peoples there is, allegedly, a strip of the country that's *Goldilocks*. That's where I want to be - not too Muslim extremist, not too kidnappy, but *just right*.
While I can’t sleep, let’s stew on some more Nigerian fun facts.
It's the most populous country in all of Africa.
One in every five Africans is a Nigerian (mind: blown).
It could be called the world capital for corruption and fraud. You've probably got a few of their emails...
It's got a reputation for violent crime.
There’s practically a violent “coup d’etat” every time there’s an election.
I've been told to watch out for "stickmen", people who ambush cars using clubs of wood with a nails through them as weapons...
The capital, Lagos, is currently the third most populous city in the world, and is predicted by 2025 to take the top spot.
As I write this there are, give or take, twenty two million people in this single city alone. The entire population of my entire home country just happens to be the exact same number. Every person in Australia – Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Hobart and everywhere in-between – all in one place.
It’s doing a number on my head.
And I’m not sure if I can do it; it's the compounding weight of the number of people who have told me along the journey that it just "can’t be done". *Under no circumstances*.
My emotions make a quantum leap, straight from terrified despair over to hope, from gut twisting nervousness straight over to being excited as a kid on Christmas Eve, and in the click of a finger straight back to fretting.
I'm living in the extremities of the pendulum without a moment spent in the middle ground. And as the night wears on it's wearing me thin.
Lagos is my first stop.
*Twenty two million...*
It’s right on the other side of the border; there’s nowhere else to go. I don’t even get to dip my toe in the joint till I have to dive in the deep end.
Forecast for tomorrow: Thunderstorms.
I’m not even joking.
You wouldn’t know it just looking at me, but I can’t stop the tremor in my fucking hands. 
I feel like I’ve had 10 cups of coffee, and maybe something illicit to go with it.
They won’t just sit. And every so often the bloody thing runs from my toes right up to the top of my head and then back down again, like I’m shivering, even though I’m sweating my arse off.
*Fuck this.*
---
I wake up.
I come to my senses.
*Today’s the day.*
As I realise where I am I’m more than a little proud that I somehow managed to sleep, but the pride is gone in a flash and I pick up just where I left off the night before.
Time for the shit to start hitting the fan, and not stop hitting it till I’m in Cameroon, *covered* in shit.
I feel like I’m back at school, with some sort of awful public speaking in front of the class to do.
Or like I’m about to do my driver’s license test.
It’s that feeling, but on a whole new level of jitters.
*Gut wrenching.*
There's nothing left to do but to do it.
Like ripping off a band-aid.
Up I get, and go through the motions of a normal day in the saddle. I don’t reckon I can stomach a breakfast though, not today...
Before I know it I’m on the highway, staring up at the blackening sky, and wondering what’s going to fall apart first; me, or the clouds...
---
The border post isn’t a goddamn thing like I was expecting; the other Benin border of two days ago has clearly given me unrealistic expectations.
*This* is a dog’s breakfast.
A whole bloody village has popped up on the Benin side just to feed off the post.
*That's a bad sign.*
I’m joining the dots that it means that lots of people pass through this post, and that they probably spend quite a bit of time, and money, trying to get through.
The street is completely choked.
I’ve got to waddle my bike through the crowds at a crawl, with the crush of noise and people towering over me, sitting on the bike.
*You’d hate to be claustrophobic...* It's even worse than the Ivory Coast / Ghana border.
Inch at a time I make it through to a lowered boom gate, where I park up the bike and head over to the hut next to it.
It’s the Beninese Police.
Despite the buzz of people outside, in here it's just a big kahuna, an assistant, and me.
The big kahuna is sitting behind a desk. He’s a thickset big lad, somewhere in middle age. He's in full dress uniform; hat and everything.
He doesn’t look too happy to be here.
I give him my passport to get stamped out and sit down in the chair opposite him.
He barely looks at my passport, and is more interested in my bike papers. I don’t know why; *it’s none of his fucking business;* I’m not *coming* to Benin, I’m *leaving*.
I protest, and say I just need the passport stamped, *thanks*, but he’s insisting on seeing the papers.
What can I do?
I give him the papers.
He demands 20,000CFA for me to take the bike through.
That’s about $40. And that’s total bullshit. *It doesn’t cost a clam* to take a bike *out* of a country.
But, I can’t leave without this guy giving me the exit stamp in my passport; it’s the one and only thing I need on the Benin side.
He takes my “Je ne comprend pas” - *I don't understand* - as a language barrier thing, and I’m happy for him to think that.
My only shot is to hope that he gets sick of asking me. So I get comfortable in the chair for the game of patience and thousands of “Je ne comprend pas”.
And back and forth we go...
He’s quickly getting the shits with me.
That’s good. I think...
And then someone else comes into the hut.
*A white girl.*
I can’t believe what I’m seeing...
Legit.
*A... White... Woman...*
In her thirties, maybe.
And she's doing *this* border.
And I thought *I* was mad...
Along with a healthy dose of perspective, she brings into the tent a question in too-fluent-French for me to follow. The cop points to her a direction, further down the road, and she leaves without another word.
*Wait a second...*
The penny drops.
That could’ve been in Chinese and I couldn't have mistaken the meaning.
*I've got this bastard.*
My French improves considerably, and I ask the cop if I even get the stamp *here*. He just says I have to pay him 20,000CFA, and nothing else, but there’s a note to his voice that he isn’t so sure of himself anymore...
Game's up, fucker.
I snatch my papers off the desk and jump out of my seat and walk off, folding the papers and tucking them into my inside pocket as quick as I can, and say over my shoulder that “je par pour le tampon eh jarreev. Daccor?” *I go for the stamp and come back. Ok?* 
This could go one of two ways; sail through, or deep shit.
I’m followed out onto the road, but I'm not manhandled. It’s feeble protests rather than demands.
*I’ve won...*
I walk past the bike towards where he directed that white girl.
He catches up to me, walking ahead like an escort, saying something I can’t catch.
I take the chance behind his back and turn on my heel, and head back to the bike, pulling on my helmet as I walk.
By the time he cogs that he's walking alone and comes running back I've already got the motor started.
I put out my hand, stand the bike up, flick the kickstand, and shake his hand.
“Merci pour votra assistance.” *Thanks for your help*.
He looks more sad than anything else...
I ride to the boom gate blocking my path and bypass it through a pedestrian path off to the side.
*A lucky break.*
At the next boom gate along I cop the exact same shit; to get the bike out I need to pay.
*Why all these fucking stops and boomgates??*
This time the cops cave-in early, pointing out to me where I can get my passport stamp.
I leave them with my motorbike papers to mull over and head to where they’ve directed me.
It’s a random, standalone, single "stall". Unmarked. It looks like a cinema box office got lost and dumped in the middle of nowhere. In amongst all this sound and noise and movement, and all these different buildings, it seems like it’s being deliberately obscure. Playing hide and seek.
There’s a crowd of people around the reflective perspex sheet, all trying to jam their passports and money through the small semicircle gap at the bottom.
I eventually muscle to within an arm’s length and shove my passport through the gap.
I barely make out the muffled sound of someone on the other side of the plastic asking where my money is.
"Shon ay pa." *I don’t have any*.
The passport gets an exasperated stamp, and thrown back through the hole.
Hallelujah! Done!
I walk back to the boom gate and the fuckers with my bike papers want to give me the shits about my carnet, or rather, my not having one.
But I don’t need anything from these guys. *Nothing.* But I do need my rego papers back.
I’m all smiles. I explain why I don't need a carnet, using my bike papers as part of the demonstration, I pick them up off the table, show them an irrelevant detail of the rego, and then fold them up and put them in my pocket.
Like a fucking magician.
They don’t protest, but try to hook me up with a Nigerian fixer.
No thanks. Catch ya later.
I pass the boom gate through the pedestrian side track again, muscling the bike through the crush of people.
I’m out of Benin.
I wonder how badly that would have shafted me if it was my first rodeo; my *first* border crossing... Pretty hard, I reckon. Wouldn't have been pretty.
Even though I know what I'm about these days, I was *still* just leaves in the wind. Only luck got me through.
If I didn't know shit from shoe polish I would have been stuck there for a bloody long time.
Well... That’s the easy part done then...
---
I roll into the Nigerian side, and I’m baffled.
*Lost.*
God knows I’ve done a lot of border crossings, but there’s never been one that looks like *this...*
It’s just so *busy*. There are different stalls spread out willy nilly, pell mell, everywhere.
And I mean everywhere.
Three parallel mud roads, full of buildings and stalls.
Fuck. There must be more of them than I can count on my fingers *and* toes...
A border *should* have three essential services; Immigration, Customs, and Police.
That’s it.
*What's going on here then??*
They’ve all got signposts with different names and acronyms that aren’t making any sense. And they should be making sense: the language in Nigeria is English.
I find something that, to my eye, looks police-ish, and a little immigration-y. Plus, it’s busy, and that should be a good sign that it’s something that everyone needs to get done.
I muscle in and chuck them my passport.
Bullseye.
My passport gets stamped without a single question, and not one single demand.
How refreshing.
The bloke in the stall next door harangues me, and he won't let me go. He's from the “secret service”. He wants to see my passport. It’s definitely unusual to have a "special police" presence at a border, but it’s not a first. In the past they’ve only ever taken down my passport details and that’s it.
So he gets my passport, writes down the details, hands the passport back to me, and then demands “dash”. A bribe.
He cops a flat rejection and a walk off.
How have this mob not figured out yet that the time to ask for money is while they're holding something that I need, *not* after they've given it back to me??
Anyway, Customs time...
There’s a small booth down the mud road with "Customs" marked out in the name. There's two surly looking middle aged women behind it.
I see on the walk up that there’s nothing on their desk to be issuing a TIP with - stamps and papers and whatnot - so I ask where I can go to get a TIP They point out to me a shipping container about a football kick away.
They get really, *really* shitty at me as I walk off without giving them any money.
---
The shipping container marked out with 'Customs' is all closed up...
Maybe not the right place? A random bloke nearby tells me it’s not open when he sees me staring at it.
"Why not?"
"It's a public holiday today."
"What? And they're shut?"
"Yes."
"Righto... Fuck. Where can I get papers then?"
"Not today."
*"Not today??"*
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
My brain crunches out the three possible outcomes of not having an TIP for the bike today. And none of them are good:
A) Leave the bike behind and come back tomorrow, fingers crossed.
B) Stamp out of Nigeria, go back to Benin, say hi to all the people I just pissed off and try to get them to let me back into the country, then do it all again tomorrow.
C) Chance it - in *Nigeria* - without any papers for the bike. 
Suboptimal...
I *hate* this shit.
I tell the guy that that’s not possible.
He points me out another shipping container - also marked Customs - but with some acronym after it.
*What's the difference?*
I go over and poke my head inside.
It’s dimly lit inside, and with the dark clouds outside it doesn’t make things too easy to see. Despite the dark inside the bloke behind the desk is still having a crack at reading the paper. He must eat a lot of carrots...
I step over the threshold.
I make introductions, shake hands and explain the situation. He asks for my carnet. I explain that I don’t have one. And he flatly rejects me.
No carnet, No TIP.
What would be the point in getting a fucking TIP if I had a carnet already??
I ignore that and throw up the usual tactic of verbal diarrhoeaing all the places I’ve managed to go without a carnet, all with no problem.
He thinks about this...
"Let me talk to my boss."
Good. That’s progress.
"The boss" is out of "the office" for a bit, so I head back to the bike while I wait.
The bike is always easy to find: it’s wherever the crowd is.
I always feel like I bit of a rockstar when I get there, like, "yep, it’s mine." It always gives me a kick when I fire her up; no one ever looks at it and thinks it’s going to make such beautiful music.
I roll her over to "the office", and wait.
---
An hour comes and then goes. I eat a banana. Every time I stick my head back into the shipping container I get the same answer: "soon".
I'm thinking that in the meantime I should probably be using my time efficiently and changing some money over into the local "Naira", but I’m not sure that revealing how much I’m packing is such a great idea. I'm not ready to reveal my hand just yet...
Halfway into the second banana I’m called into the container: "The boss will see you now."
The boss’s office is on the other side of a partition in the shipping container, and he’s a she.
A round of applause for progressive Nigeria.
She flat out rejects me. Carnet, again.
*Fuck.*
There’s no other way that I can do this... It *has* to work. I *have to* have a TIP.
I start talking again, the same usual spiel of countries done without the carnet.
When I get to the end of that she gives me a squinty look with her lips smushed into a thin line. Considering.
“Ok, no problem.”
I have to stop myself from punching the air and tap-dancing.
*You little fucking ripper!*
She gives the ok to the newspaper man outside and he goes to write me up a TIP. “You need to pay the bond, you get it back when you come back.”
"When I come back? But I’m going to Cameroon... How does that work?”
“Cameroon?”
“Yeah, Cameroon.”
“You’re not coming back here?”
“What? No. Why would I?”
“You must come back here. Cameroon is no good.”
*Sheeeeeet!*
I give a shrug of the shoulders and he tells me to wait while he takes it up with the boss.
I’m right back at square one. After getting so excited, this feels like a kick in the teeth.
I’m sick of worrying and fighting for this shit...
After what feels like a long time he comes back. It seems that without a bond there’s no actual issuing fee, so they’ve decided to skip the bond and just give it to me *for free*.
*Fist pump.* Can't help it.
He takes my details, takes a forever to write up what must be the most detailed TIP anywhere in the world; three full pages of the stuff. Stamps everywhere.
“Now, you give me something, eh?”
Done. Fair enough. I don’t want any drama, or to get rejected after all that, so I give him 6,000 of my CFA, the usual high-end price for a LP – about 15 bucks worth – and we’re done here.
*That’s a wrap.*
I pocket the papers and shoo away the gathered mob from the bike.
I slowly ride through the rest of the border post, with various people giving me a loud “PSSST!!” or a half-hearted “Hey!! Hey!!” trying to get my attention to see if I’ll stop for them. But I know I have everything I need and to stop for anyone else could get me into some more drama I don’t need.
No one steps up to forcibly stop me, and I’m through the last barricade and into Nigeria.
Gotta smile. I'm in Nigeria. *This is ridiculous.*

## Chapter Thirty Two
Early impressions are surprising. It’s all agricultural space and farm land with the occasional small village.
*Where are all the people?*
What’s *not* surprising is that there are checkpoints.
*Lots* of checkpoints.
More checkpoints than any place I’ve ever been to, by a long way.
Hands down.
I've done the math, I'm passing a checkpoint roughly every five clicks.
*Every five clicks* there’ll be a mob of blokes standing around in some variety of camouflage, with big fuck off guns. Occasionally they have a nasty spike strip.
Mean looking bastards.
They seem to be stopping folks at random.
And I stand out like dogs balls...
There’s no trees on the side of the road, so I can spot a checkpoint from a mile off; well before they've spotted me.
The traffic’s thin, but there’s some vehicles plodding about. So every time I see a checkpoint I find something bigger than me – a car, a van, a truck, a mob of other motorbikes, whatever – and sit in the checkpoint's blind spot. I figure that I can use the “screen” to get past without being seen, or, alternatively, if my screen gets pulled over or I get spotted, I can just pretend that they were trying to stop the other vehicle - my screen - and hope I don’t get shot by some trigger happy army goober on the way out.
*They won't see me till it's too late to stop me.*
---
It's worked beautifully.
From the twenty checkpoints I've counted in the hundred odd clicks to outer Lagos I’ve either not been spotted, ignored, or even given a wave through.
In only two of the twenty was I ever noticed. They *tried* to stop me - with lots of yelling and blowing of whistles and waving of whatever was to hand - but they were too late to get in my way.
I didn’t stop. Of course.
Despite it all going *far* better than my loftiest expectations, it didn’t stop me from holding my breath for all of them. Each and every time I'd only realise that I was out of breath when I came out the other end with no holes in me.
I had to pant to catch my breath; my heart smashing in my ears each time.
*I wish I was handling this better.*
The skies are grey, but not nearly as ominous-grey as the thunderstorm’s that were predicted.
It's all working out so well.
---
The green agriculture quickly gives way to built-up dinginess.
The further I go into it the thicker and dingier it gets.
Traffic starts to get cloggy.
With some creative riding I get through the micro-jams caused by taxi-vans stopping on the side of the highway to pick up passengers.
I nearly get my fucking head taken clean off by some truck driver who decides to open his door while I’m cutting through one of the jams. I manage to weave the bike a tiny amount to the side and tilt my head a fraction the same way - all in a split of a second - while the door swings open. Like The fucking Matrix. Didn’t even have time to swear. The truck door missed my helmet by *nothing*, a moment later and I would’ve taken it full in the face.
Decapitated.
A head in a helmet.
Nothing surer.
As I look in the mirrors, the truck's door is right where my head used to be.
"Mother-*fucker!*"
At the next micro-jam I decide to just wait it out in the traffic...
---
It starts to sprinkle rain.
The traffic's going at a half-walk half-jog.
Between me and the never ending line of tinned shanty shops on the side of the highway, there’s a section of mud about a good spitting distance wide that's running parallel to the highway. I wonder how deep it is... I wonder if I should have a crack at it and ride on the other side...
*It would be quicker...*
Sizing it up, I spot someone lying in the mud a ways off ahead.
In the mud... *Nude?*
I can see as I get closer that they're only in shorts, and the *shorts are around the knees...*
*What??*
Face down, bare arse to the sky.
I move forward and closer with the traffic.
It’s a young kid, a teenager based on the height, but I can only see the back of his head from here.
He hasn’t moved since I’ve spotted him...
*What the fuck is going on here??*
My eyes flick from him to the traffic and back to him.
Is he begging? Going for pity money, maybe? *Surely.*
I roll past.
I'm turning my head to him and back to the traffic and back to him and back to the traffic.
Fuck. Whoa. *Fuck...*
He’s dead.
I reckon.
I can't look back again. I wouldn't learn anything new, and I'd crash.
*Do I stop?*
I run over what I just saw in my head again. His head is twisted around enough that he’d be uncomfortable if he was alive... He’s only got about half his mouth out of the wet mud.
He didn't move. *Not an inch.*
Either died there or dumped there...
Nah. *Surely not...*
How come no one’s *doing* anything? People are walking past him at the shops, people are driving past him in their cars.
No one gave him the *slightest* attention. As much attention as if it was a dead cat...
*Fuck.* If no one cares that must mean that it’s par-for-the-course here; dead bodies in the fucking mud.
*What the fuck am I doing here??*
This was a bad idea. All of it.
The only thing that’s brought me here is fucking inertia. And that’s a rubbish reason to do something as brain-dead as this.
I’m going to die in Lagos. In the mud.
How will Mum find out?
How will *anyone* find out?
What if no one *ever* finds out?
Suddenly, a realisation hits me like a bag of shit in the face: I didn’t do a *thing* about it... I just rode on by.
*Self, self, self...*
I wrack my brains; I can’t think of anyone else I’ve ever seen dead...
It’s a first.
My tension ratchets a notch.
---
The dingy build up dissolves, and gives way to the *magnificent*.
The truly magnificent.
Surprising. Delightful. *Utterly* unexpected.
Mag-fucking-nificence.
Old clogged streets turn into pristine new highways of fast moving traffic, ramping up into *huge*, sweeping, art-like flyovers; weaving up and down and around each other, over and over, like the bridges are dancing; dancing, connecting islands in the sea.
They explode out of each island like fireworks over the water.
It’s fucking beautiful.
On the islands are cities like nothing I’ve seen in West Africa.
A megalopolis; I don't have another word for it...
Sky scrapers on one side and a massive port on the other. It’s like a surreal, living, “Matchbox” car set, but in real life. Sim-fucking-city.
Almost futuristic. Definitely modern.
It’s nothing like the dingy, half-derelict "cities" you’ll find in Dakar or Abidjan, neither does it have that feeling of a “past glory”; the skyscrapers look modern, as do the pristine shopfronts lining the minor streets that branch off the highways.
The city is *immaculate.*
There are even people walking around sweeping *sand* off the streets.
I was expecting a sprawling, monolithic slum; *way* off the scales of my imagination in size, density, and decrepitude.
*That’s* where I set the bar. This is fucking *Lagos*, after all.
I’m not sure that my expectations have ever been more thoroughly wrong in my entire life. I’m thrilled to be wrong. Couldn’t be happier.
Once I feel like I'm central enough, I pull out of the flow of the flyovers and go shopping for accommodation.
---
It’s expensive.
By my count it’s about three times pricier than anywhere else I’ve been on the continent. I haggled like a fiend for two shitty hotels and don’t get anywhere near the price I’d like to hear for either of them. I’m too pigheaded to accept the inflated price, despite the fact that the afternoon’s getting on a bit.
Other problems: I’ve got *no* local money, and I’ve only had two bananas to eat all day...
I roll up to the YMCA (yeah, they’ve got a fuckin *YMCA*, bizarre).
I try to get a good price for their shithouse, filthy dorms. I fight tooth and nail for a better deal than 2,000 naira - about 15 bucks - but I’d be better off haggling with a wall.
My stomach yields. I pay.
I chuck my shit in the room, and wheel the bike through the YMCA's reception, and out into it's big, empty, safe courtyard.
The bloke running the joint cracks the shits it at me. Says can't keep it in the courtyard...
*Seriously?*
What does he reckon? That I’m going to keep it out on the street??
Yep. That’s *exactly* what he reckons.
And that’s a deal breaker. Fuck you.
This is the first time that I’ve ever been told to keep the bike on the road.
Ridiculous.
It doesn't make any *sense*. There’s *nothing* in the courtyard. It's enormous. And the place isn’t exactly popular; I reckon I’m the only person staying here.
So why does the bloke give a shit??
I try everything I can to convince him otherwise, but he - frustratingly as hell - won’t see reason. He’s sticking to his guns: my bike isn’t allowed in the courtyard. Full-stop. I reckon this guy’s got a mate he’s gonna call tonight, who’ll liberate me of my vehicle and cut my new buddy in on the proceeds.
Unless he’s going to nick it himself.
That’s the only explanation I’ve got for this retard; that he's tee-ing me up to get fucked; nothing else stands to reason.
I’m on the knife's edge of loading the bike back up with all my shit and riding off with a finger in the air. But I don’t know where else I could go, I’m out of ideas. And *properly* hungry.
And that’s the syncher.
I roll the dice, and roll the bike back out the front.
---
Today, nineteen people were killed by a car bomb in the capital, Abuja.
Boko Haram. Again.
Has this been happening this often, this bloody, this regularly, forever? Is it just that I’m here now, and paying keen attention to it, that I’m hearing a lot more about all of these attacks? Or is this a new thing?
It certainly seems to be the flavour of the month; with the abduction of the three hundred school girls in Chibok really making a splash in the news.
It’s curious, because it would seem that no one here - actually *in* Nigeria - particularly cares.
Couldn’t tell you why.
There’s also some “intelligence” that I’ve caught wind of that Boko Haram are going to bomb Lagos. Soon, they say...
Anyway, the car bombing puts the nail into the coffin of the idea to head to Abuja to grab visas for the next countries. Which means that the embassy for Cameroon here in Lagos is going to have to stick, or bust...

## Chapter Thirty Three
I'm up early. Edgy.
I pop my head out the front door. The bike's still there...
I'm actually surprised to see it.
I was starting to dream how nice it would be if it got nicked and I could just fly home...
I grab my papers and get walking.
There are twenty two million people in this city, but I’m left wondering where they all are; the streets are practically deserted.
Normal? Or ominous?
It’s definitely eerie.
I have that feeling I've missed something important. Again.
Anyway. I play deaf Marco Polo with anyone I can find, and I've managed to locate the Cameroonian Embassy. Is Cameroonian even a word? Dunno.
I’m greeted at the gate by a man who looks like he’s never smiled in his entire life. Not once. Child, adolescent, man; never a smile.
I’m unceremoniously rejected.
I'm not about to be rejected by a fucking *guard*...
I wheedle my way through and talk to someone who knows what they're talking about.
I’m unceremoniously rejected, again; they won't issue me a visa here. Why? They won't say.
Apparently, I need to try my luck in a place called "Calabar", which is the Nigerian town next to the Cameroonian border.
So I find myself with a very empty day in Lagos.
What to do?
---
Money.
I find a money changer and get all my CFA exchanged for Naira, all at the correct, official rate. I don’t even haggle for it... It’s the first time that this has ever happened, and to have it happen in Lagos, well, that’s pretty friggin suspicious. But it’s all there... I study the notes; where most currencies would have a picture of the head of someone important on it - like kings, queens or presidents or whatever - here they have a picture of an oil rig. The pride and joy of Nigerians everywhere...
Hilarious.
The notes look fine. Guess I've got to stop looking this gift horse in the mouth.
---
Breakfast.
It’s rice blended with beans and spaghetti and a mysterious brown sauce. The "protein" is a small, brown, fried fish that's been bent back to bite its tail; which makes it look like a petrified, coiled up turd.
On my plate.
They say that you "eat with your eyes"... Not true; it's all delicious.
Time. To. Wander.
*Why not?*
I know it’s not smart, but my curiosity is outweighing my fear and my rationality.
Curiosity killed the cat, sure, but the rest of the cats are boring. What did I come here for if not to see something new?
This place hasn’t been at all what I was expecting and I want to see more of it.
I orient myself in the direction of the biggest tower, and walk.
---
An hour of walking.
I’m still wondering where everyone is...
I’ve walked kilometres of main roads, over the bridge from Victoria Island into Lagos Island, and now I'm going down the wide main streets - between the big modern towers - and the place still feels *empty*. I can’t make heads or tails of it.
After some more aimless walking I find the "market quarter" of town, nestled in the shadows of the skyscrapers.
I’m still not sure that this is a good idea to head into it... Might land me in the shit; if there are unsavoury sorts here - *and I know there are* - then this is surely where they’re gonna be.
But, on the walk this far I’ve been surprised with how little hassle I’ve been getting. *I copped worse in Morocco...*
I was expecting people to be looking at me like “Hey, who’s the guy with the death wish?”, but it looks like no one really gives a shit.
*I feel confident about this.*
I head in.
---
*This* is more of what I was expecting.
Grimey and muddy and tight and loud and claustrophobic.
People. *Finally.*
It's not too far different to anything else I've seen in other African capitals; same people flogging the same shit with the same sounds and the same, *ripe*, smells. The only difference is that this one is massive.
*I can’t believe how well this is going.*
Other than getting a few looks, which, being honest, is pretty normal, no one’s giving me a shred of grief.
I can’t believe it. It’s supposed to be *Lagos*. This place - which has been the source of all of my dreamed up worst nightmares - is turning out to be a *cakewalk*.
Shouldn’t someone be stabbing me right about now and making off with my earlobes? Where are all the guns and gangs??
The megalomaniac cynic in me reckons that they’re all here, but they’re not messing with me because they’ve come to the conclusion that for me to be here all by myself I must either be as hard as a coffin nail, or completely insane.
I hope that's true. Makes me feel like a wild man.
---
I’ve still not popped out the other side, or even looked like popping out any side of anything. It’s all still mud and crush and loud noises in cramped, claustrophobic spaces. I've been walking for a *long* time.
I should have popped out *somewhere* by now, but I’m still in here.
All at once I realise that I don’t even know which direction I’m facing anymore... *Fuck.*
Have I been walking in circles? The walls of buildings are crowding in on all sides so I can’t see any landmarks, or towers, or even where the sun is in the sky. I've got no way to get my bearings back.
From what I can tell from down here, the alleys have been weaving about like a psychedelic maze. I thought I was going in straight lines, but maybe I’ve been slowly turned about...
My isolation hits me all at once; even in this madhouse of people I feel all alone.
The crush of people and the loudness of it all aren’t helping me stay level headed.
*I wish I had my compass...* But I’m not even sure that would help me at the moment...
I want out of here. I want out *right now.*
Now now. *Get me out of here*.
I suppress an urge - a strong one - to break into a little jog-walk.
I walk. Fast.
And then faster.
I'm about to break into a jog - despite myself - when I spot the top of a sky scraper *way* off in the distance.
*Thank god!*
I lock onto that direction; that’s my bearing.
I stay locked in, but I lose that when the alley forces me to go off in a direction I didn't want to go.
I try to hold my bearing again, but it's all so confusing. *Nothing is straight*.
I'm lost, again.
I don't dare let anyone know that I'm lost. It'd be too easy to be taken advantage of.
I walk in my best guess of a single direction, and walk, and walk, and walk...
---
The market opens up, and I burst out onto an open road in full sunshine.
Thank *Christ*.
I suck in the air and try to calm the fuck down.
With the sun back I can get a rough idea of the points of the compass - a very rough idea - but I've got no fucking idea where *I* am. Zero. With all that walking I could be anywhere...
I take a guess; south.
And set off.
---
Another hour.
I'm wigging out.
*I hate this*.
Hate hate hate hate hate...
---
*I've been here before.* This place...
I look around me.
I have.
I have I have I have.
I was on this road yesterday on the bike...
It's enough.
I'm done.
I'm going to find my way home.
*I survived the market quarter of Lagos.*
Weirdly, I feel a sense of both achievement and of being short-changed.
But if you’d told me just a year ago while I was back in the sky prison that in 365 days time I’d be walking - alone - through market quarter Lagos in Nigeria I wouldn’t have believed it. I’d have said you’re full of shit.
Funny, the turns life can take.
Lagos has been one giant surprise, but tomorrow it’s time to move on.

## Chapter Thirty Four
The bike survives two days and nights on the streets.
What are the odds?
Getting out of Lagos is a breeze.
Instead of going through all that shit like I went through on the way in, the exit out to the east has a bridge over the ocean that hugs to the shape of the mainland, and just goes and goes and goes. Bypassing everything.
From the bridge it looks like the mainland of Lagos is one massive, uninterrupted, derelict slum.
So *that’s* where everyone is.
There’s your "whole population of Australia in one city" right there.
I’m starting to wonder about the "authenticity" of my Lagos experience.
But I'm not about to turn back just to see what the slums are like, just for "authenticity".
Shit, I'm happy that I don't even have to ride through it to get out of this joint...
Onward to Benin City; don’t ask me what Benin City has to do with the country of Benin. I don’t know. Probably nothing.
Anyway. Let’s see if we can’t find the other hundred and fifty million punters here in Nigeria. I bet at least one million are policemen...
*This is going to be shit.*
---
Nope.
*Nigeria strikes again.*
I'm loving being surprised.
I'm not far from Benin City, and all I've seen on the ride is a sparsely trafficked, decent, two lane highway, lined by dense, thick greenery of overarching canopied trees and other green stuff.
Nothing but green. The whole way.
It's been one of the nicest rides of the whole trip...
Unbelievable.
Who’d have thought it? *Nigeria*, for fucks sake.
*Where are all the people??*
And the whole distance there’s been only one checkpoint.
*One!*
And, true to form, I rode straight through it. No worries.
I can't believe any of this. Every single one of my expectations and prejudices against this place has been completely, utterly wrong.
My only thoughts now are with the bike. Tuned in through my ears, hands, feet and arse to every note and vibration coming from it.
I worry about a persistent "jolt" that I feel every now and again in the foot pegs. It's like someone gives the bottom of the footrest a little whack with a hammer every now and again.
Curious.
Sprocket and chain?
Maybe...
There's fuck all I can do about it while I’m riding, so I really ought to just forget about it and enjoy myself.
It's twenty odd clicks to ride till Benin City. I’m feeling good, surprisingly good, fresh even, given it's been a long day in the saddle; three hundred odd clicks and maybe five or six solid hours of riding since Lagos. Despite skipping lunch I’m not even feeling hungry. The miles and time has somehow just breezed right on by.
---
I’m flying along at a clip, pulling out and overtaking a couple of slow moving big trucks - halfway past the first.
*Ping*.
In my brain.
It almost makes a noise.
*I can’t think.*
My thoughts lose focus. Then disappear. 
I feel weird.
I feel dizzy.
*What’s happening??*
My eyes lose focus.
I can’t see straight.
I can’t see clearly.
Suddenly, unpleasantly *drunk* all over.
Oh fuck it’s all going fuzzy.
*What is this???*
The points at the side of my jaw go sour, then tight.
*I’m going to be sick.*
*Boom!* Adrenaline! *Fizz!*
*I’m going to throw up in my helmet.*
Keep going. Roll on. Roll. It’ll pass it’ll pass it’ll pass...
Gasping. Lungs heaving.
Head lolling.
My heart revs.
Everything feels straight, but the bike starts sliding to the right.
*The world* moves to the right.
To the right. To the right...
It won’t stop.
To the right.
I pass the second truck.
My body moves in my mind - and my senses tell me the bike should straighten - but not in the world. It doesn't happen.
The world rotates slowly the other way.
The bike keeps drifting, right, right.
I can’t stop it.
I can’t move.
*I'm going to be sick.*
I’m going to collapse.
I'm fucked.
*Am I dying?* 
Am I fucking *dying*??
Brakes.
Brakes!!
The whole world is flying in queasy cartwheels to the right that snap back to upright. Again, again, again...
We stop.
I put the bike, somehow, onto the stand, to the left. 
*Swoon...*
What happens after I black out? In *Nigeria*...
Where will I wake up?
*Will I wake up?*
The helmet comes off.
The jacket.
I walk. Stumble. And I breathe. *Deep.*
Frantic. Eyes wild. My face scrunches itself up.
Oh fuck. *This is it...*
I’m fucked. I’m fucked fucked fuck. 
*What is this???*
---
It comes off. Slow.
I don’t throw up.
I stay awake.
I pop my ears; squeezing on my nose and blowing pressure into it to equalise my eardrums. I don’t know why I'd do that. 
Each second, each step, I’m a little further from the edge.
A little further from the floor.
The bile receding. My jaw still feels sour and clenched.
The vision slowly focusing. 
The storm’s passing.
Still dizzy.
Still can’t walk in a straight line.
Still can’t *think* in a straight line. 
*I don’t feel like me...*
Not myself...
What just happened?
What do I do *now?* 
*I can’t stay here...*
But to ride on... I can’t barely *walk* straight, can’t see straight, can’t think straight... I can't ride like this...
What else can I do? Call for help?
I get on the bike, and I ride.
---
I can control it enough to keep it upright and moving forward.
My breathing won’t take care of itself; something feels very wrong. I don’t think I’m breathing properly on my body's autopilot - so I take over myself.
In, out, in, out, in, out...
I hyperventilate; My arms and nose are tingling with the overload of oxygen.
I stop the bike again.
---
I go again.
I stop again.
I go again...
---
I only just start to feel normal again as I pull into Benin City.
I can think, a little.
*I can't believe I made it...*

## Chapter Thirty Five
*What the fuck?*
What the fuck was it? What the fuck does it mean?
I ponder over a crappy late lunch in a crappy, unpopular, dingy restaurant.
Something’s not right, no doubt about that. And it *still* ain’t right, even now I’m not feeling quite like myself.
Blanking out and then nearly blacking out altogether, while doing nothing but riding a motorbike. That shit ain’t normal. At all.
Brain?
Diet?
Anaemia?
Blood-sugar?
Iron?
Calories?
Cancer?
Brain cancer???
Malaria?
Parasite?
Something crawling through my brain, chewing stuff?
I could’ve picked up one of those fuckers any one of a hundred different ways...
Hookworm? Aren't they the ones who latch onto the bottom of your foot, dig through, get into your bloodstream and head to the brain and start eating? Or laying eggs or some shit?
I’ve been walking in nothing but thongs for *months...*
What about "vertigo"? A fucked up inner ear? My mum had that once; she woke up one night and before she knew it she was flat on the floor, world spinning in her head. Couldn’t stand up without pitching over. Lasted *days*. Nausea. Uncoordinated. Feeling like being on a roller coaster when sitting still... 
*Sound’s familiar.*
Even if what just happened was a bit milder as far as symptoms go, the consequences of unexpectedly falling over are a fair bit different when the floor is moving under you at eighty clicks an hour...
In outback Nigeria, for fucks sake.
Fuck I hope it’s that though; vertigo would be a very neat and tidy cause – one that won’t kill me. That's my favourite part about it...
Typhoid?
Haven’t been feeling crook...
I don’t know.
What to do?
Do something? Or do nothing?
I'll wait and see what happens next...
---
I keep getting interrupted in my morbid daydreaming and shitty lunch by people wanting to talk to me, coming up to say hello, despite what must be a fucking sour look on my face.
The conversation each time feels less like a friendly chat and more like an interrogation in some of the worst pidgin-English I’ve ever heard - almost unrecognisable as English at all; at most I’m getting a couple of words out of each sentence.
What I do manage to catch is roughly this: Where you come from? What name you? Where you stay? What hotel? You tell me. Tell me. You have phone? What number? You give me this. You give me your email.
Erm. *Fuck you?*
Seriously, shake my hand and then try to shake me down for info, shit like that.
You can all get fucked.
Could be all innocent curiosity - maybe - but the tone and body language would seem to wipe that out.
I feel like I’m being "cased". And it gets my back right up...
One bloke even asks me what my hotel *room number* is. And when I say I don’t know he say’s “we should go there now.”
All this is giving me the willies...
I was feeling pretty tender already, without needing to deal with this shit.
I turn myself into a bastard. A complete arsehole. A right cabbage. Rude fucker. Essentially telling them in fairly short words to give me some space.
But these jerks are nothing if not persistent.
I chow down the shithouse lunch, pay, and leave.
One of my new “friends” won’t leave me be, won't stop tailing me.
I give him some stern words, but even that's not enough. I head to the markets and shake him off in the crush.
I spend the rest of the afternoon locked in my room, staring at the ceiling. I watch as the worlds loudest, loosest ceiling fan threatens to fall out of the sky and maim me spectacularly at any moment.
What a delightful day it's been...

## Chapter Thirty Six
No excuse to stay in Benin City.
None that I can think of.
I’m surprised how fresh I feel after yesterday; even with the fan keeping me up all night.
Anyway. I’m fine. It’s all fine. It’s all going to be fine.
Plus, it’s a perfect overcast today that’s going to make for comfortably cool riding.
I force myself to saddle up and take off.
*Get on with it.*
---
It's been a pretty unremarkable day, thank Christ.
The only point of interest has been the huge lines of cars waiting hours to get petrol. There’s some sort of fuel crisis going on here; in a country with so much oil that they put oil rigs on their paper money. Go figure.
The shanty towns of yesterday have changed into well-ordered small cities. If I squint and stretch my imagination just a little I could almost pretend at times that I’m in a western suburbia.
Very un-African.
There were five and a half checkpoints for the day. I snuck past one and a half; got seen a mile off for another two, didn’t stop but didn’t exactly get waved through either; and openly and flagrantly busted two, to much yelling and excitement in my mirrors.
The “half” checkpoint was an un-uniformed man carrying an AK-47, stopping cars that were forced to slow down for a short stretch of narrow road full of potholes.
*Pretty sure that's not legit...*
Christ knows what he was doing to the cars that he stopped. I’m just glad he was already busy with a car when I snuck past.
I’ve still been holding my breath for each and every checkpoint.
I've crossed the Niger River.
Welcome to old *Biafra.*
The day ends in a place called Enugu.
I copped some light headedness today, but no full blown “episode”.
Enugu’s alright.
I shack up.
---
I get fucked on lunch because I didn’t haggle the price in advance; having already eaten the food, I was at the wrong end of the stick, with no leverage.
They charged me ten times what it should have been worth.
I wanted to vomit it all up on their counter... I flew off the handle, yelling daylight robbery, but they wouldn’t budge.
*Lesson learnt;* same way that cops shouldn't haggle for bribes after they've given me back my passport, I shouldn't haggle for food once I've already swallowed it all...
Spent the afternoon in a local flash hotel using their interwebs for the cost of a coffee. Brilliant. And air-conditioned too... Mum's freaking out back home because the U.S. have intel that a terrorist group is planning to bomb the Intercontinental Hotel in Lagos...
Reckon that’s fair enough to be freaking out over...
I’m more worried about the weather; it’s forecast for thunderstorms. All week...
Two good friends of mine got married back home, it’s happening right now, and I’m sad to miss the occasion and the celebration.
I miss my mates.
---
After sticking around longer than was polite after only buying one coffee, I head back to my dingy shoebox as dusk is settling to stare at a wall or read a book or something.
The lady running the joint tells me that I have to leave; I can’t stay anymore.
*What? Why?*
They’ve double booked the room or some shit...
For some reason my brain hits a small panic button, and I have a little bit of that fizzing, dripping dread go through my system.
My back is well and truly up.
There’s no one even staying in this shithole, for fucks sake!
I tell her that I’m not leaving - won’t leave - the other bloke will have to leave.
I smell a rat; or some scam to get me up to a more expensive room or something - some sort of extortion. 
The hostess is having none of it. She won’t budge; I’ve got to go. She tells me that their rooms are all booked and I'll have to go to the hotel across the road.
She wants me to move hotels when it's getting *dark*.
*Is she insane?*
I fight, hard. She insists right back. Again and again and again and again and...
*Fuck it!*
What option do I have anyway?
“Righto, let's go see the other hotel then.”
“No, you take your bags. Now. First.”
*Why???*
I'm still smelling that rat...
“No... I want to see the room first.”
“No, you must take your things.”
I reckon she’s in cahoots with the hotel across the road, and once I get there - with all my shit - they’re going to scam me on the price. Or someone’s going to thieve my shit out on the dark streets... Ambush, mugging.
“No... That's *retarded*... I'm not taking *anything* till I see the room.”
Back and forth we go. Again and again and again.
It escalates.
As I walk out the front door into the front courtyard - *without* the bags - I'm fucking *fuming*. Pissed right the fuck off.
It's getting dark - *quickly* - and they're kicking me out of the hotel without so much as a fucking apology.
She's chasing me, haranguing me about the bags.
I turn right around and spray some serious vitriol.
There’s finger stabbing.
I’m sure that I’ve *never* spoken – yelled, even – in this tone before *in my life*.
Let alone to a woman.
I scare myself. For some reason I’m reminding myself of my dad when we were kids. It’s weird that I would channel him giving us a verbal lashing when we’d be in some seriously deep shit, but there you go. *Analyse that...*
Anyway. I’m fucking out of there - storming across the road - with my sparring partner reluctantly tailing me at a distance.
I barge into the other hotel. I want to kick the fucking door down. I demand a room.
*Fully booked.*
"Fuck!!"
*Are you fucking kidding me.* This is *Enugu* for Christ’s sake. Who the *fuck* is staying in *Enugu?*
I already feel vindicated that I didn't hump all my bags here just to be rejected...
On the walk to the next hotel I apologise to my ex-host for flying off the handle. Hot on the heels of the apology I also explain that I was well and truly in the fucking right due to the clusterfuck we find ourselves in now, going from hotel to hotel, *in the fucking dark*, and that only by sticking to what *I* wanted is it not even worse.
Worst apology ever.
The next hotel is a few minutes walk up the road. The price is something like 6,000 Naira. What’s that? Fuck it! It's too much. I'm out of goddamn patience for math; all I know is that it’s a lot.
I take long strides to the next hotel and leave the hostess in my wake.
The "Gutsy Motel" is a pile of shit. Truly.
*Fully booked.*
"God fucking damn it! Fuck this shit!!"
By the time I’ve stomped to the next joint it’s completely dark outside.
I open the front door and step in. There's no lights in this hotel, so inside it's almost pitch black.
I walk the empty hallways, feeling my way about, hand on a wall to guide me. "Hallooooo??"
*Creepy.*
Someone steps out of the darkness and I crap a cinder block, I scream just a little.
It's the boss.
She has a room. For 3,500 Naira. It's too much, but I'm out of options and out of time and out of light. I take it.
---
I move my shit in the dark and leave the other lot rather tersely.
*Fuck 'em.*
A day of being fucked about, really.
Though, that said, this new place I'm staying in is infinitely nicer than the other joint; my room's got air conditioning, enough room to swing a cat and just generally not dingy feeling.
The odd thing is that it's all in an old shipping container outside the hotel.
*Weird.*
---
The night *pisses* rain. Hoses it with *violence*.
Tomorrow might be a total wipe. A write off...

## Chapter Thirty Seven
In the morning twilight, lying in bed, I’ve got half a foot in sleep, half a foot out. I'm not really here... I cog that the sun is up, that the storm has passed.
Time passes. Who knows how much...
*BANG, BANG, BANG!!*
*Slamming* on the metal front door.
I’m wide eyed and standing naked on my bed like I'm surfing it. Very, *very* much awake.
*BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!!*
I’m up to the eyeballs in adrenaline, *terrified*, as I chuck my hobo pants on and head to the door.
I answer the shipping container door by sliding a metal bar out of the way and pulling back the thick metal door back on its hinges.
There’s a little man standing on the other side.
“Is everything ok?” he has the voice of a munchkin on helium.
“Yes! I’m sleeping. Why?” sharply. I don't know whether to be relieved or pissed off...
“You’re air-conditioning isn’t on...” I have *never* heard a voice like it...
“So??”
“You should turn it on.” Is he fucking serious??
“Ok thank you bye now.” I slam the big metal door in his face.
Jesus *Christ*, talk about your hotel wake up calls.
I go flick on the A/C.
Fuck's sake. I'm gonna need a sedative to come back down.
---
I take a shower and go pay the boss.
She has a hairy chest. Big thick clumps of hair.
*Queezy.*
Anyway. Despite having had adrenaline for breakfast I find it hard to get going. For some reason I don’t have my head screwed on right. I keep doing dumb shit, like totally packing the clothes side of my bags and then realising that I hadn't put my glasses in their case, which is at the bottom of the bag. And then I forget to take a pair of socks out to wear before packing.
*What's up with me today?* I never make these mistakes...
After another few fuckups that leave me shaking my head, I'm onto the bike and out of Enugu.
I’m particularly and uselessly agitated.
I can *feel* that it’s going to be a shit of a day.
Calabar is the destination. It's *well* south of my Goldilocks zone; somewhere I shouldn't be; it's that place where people kidnap oil workers for ransom... but I have to head there to get the Cameroon visa, otherwise there's no leaving Nigeria...
Going outside the Goldilocks zone has me filling the unknown with bad shit: checkpoints galore, stickmen, rebels abducting whitey road users for ransom, no bridge where I'm hoping there's going to be a bridge, no petrol, rain, thunderstorms, a flat tyre, a broken chain, going all fucked in the head and blacking out... I could go on...
I'm as jittery as a dune bug.
The feeling won’t leave me like it normally does once I get going. Won’t wash off with the ride. It just lingers. Always there.
I’m overly focused on my breathing: what is it doing? How am I feeling? Am I ok?
I get hit with occasional light headedness and nausea.
*This isn’t fun...*
I'm not sure if it's me who's bringing it out of myself or if it's a genuine symptom of something else, or even if it's just my freaked out paranoia manifesting, or if it's my new contact lenses that might not be quite right on my eyes, and the effect on my brain is to make me light headed.
I can't figure it out.
When I stop and take a walk it seems to get better.
Then something strange happens.
The thought occurs to me: *I'll be dead sometime.*
One day.
And that day could be today. I could die *today*.
And my immediate reaction is to smile.
To *smile*...
Is that fucked up or normal?
In fact, it seems to happen all the time. When I’m a bit shitty or just having a bit of a shit day, I always think that someday soon I’ll be dead, and *every time* it makes me smile.
Is that strange? That the thought of death leads to a sort of misplaced happiness that brings me to life. The swift onset of death as a way of dealing with your problems? Death as life affirming?
Everything feels trivial now.
*Who gives a fuck? I'm gonna die.*
Empowering, instead of depressing.
Does anyone else do this??
I doubt an octogenarian would find the thought "I could die today" to be empowering and uplifting...
Anyway. I stop for petrol and it’s fine.
---
The road south into the places I shouldn't be ain’t all that bad. There are a few sections that are a bit sketchy, with potholes and some rocky bits, but that’s more of a problem for those on four wheels than those on two, and I zoom on by.
About 20 clicks down the road from Enugu the map on my GPS runs out of road - so I’m on my own. Dead reckoning into the void.
I use the approximate GPS waypoint as the crow flies to help me choose which roads are my best bet to get me to Calabar.
Sketchy, but what else am I supposed to do?
The crux is going to be the river that lies between me and Calabar. Bridge or no bridge... I've no idea.
---
I get to my river, there's a bridge. Fucking beautiful.
Welcome to *Cross River State.*
From here it's a straight shot on to Calabar. 
All up, there were six checkpoints.
I haven't been killed.
No one gave me the shits.
Despite being at the other end of Nigeria, I'm *still* surprised that no one wants to stop me and shake me down. Shit... *I* would stop me and shake the shit out of me.
There's not a single 'stickman' to be seen.
The biggest risk of the day was the trucks; mix in potholes and it makes for some crazy shit.
These lunatics are *flying*, and will use up any (and all) of the road to avoid hitting a pothole - even if it’s not their part of the road to use...
At one point an oncoming truck would have taken me out as he tried to simultaneously overtake another truck, *and* dodge a pothole.
At the last moment, I had to fly off the side of the road to get out of the way of ten tonnes of death.
Happens often.
I, for my part, also ride like a complete maniac. I'll take *any* gap I can. I'll overtake a truck at full speed while another truck is oncoming at full speed, and I'll slide between the two down the middle of the road - three wide - if there's a gap there.
I'll overtake, undertake.
I have no patience, and I don't give a shit.
It makes for some hairy moments.
One in particular made me drop a nugget; a two truck pass – undertaking one truck while it was overtaking *another* truck... The salad in the sandwich.
Halfway in, one of the trucks closes out the small bit of space I have; probably trying to avoid a pothole. It’s funny: the noises that you make without knowing it when you think that a violent death is imminent... It's a primal noise, but still rather quiet considering you're about to meet the maker.
I *almost* traded paint with the truck before I shot out the other end.
If he kept coming across I would have been gently smushed between the two trucks.
This silly game is going to get me hurt or killed if I keep it up...
---
Calabar.
I'm flying a little blind trying to find a hotel.
There are some very, *very* gnarly clouds approaching.
I’ve been lucky so far - and lucky all week, for that matter - to not have copped a single drop despite the ongoing forecast of nothing but thunderstorms.
These clouds look like they want to piss on my parade...
I've been hammering it.
I pull into a hotel, park up under the small awning, and on cue it opens right up.
*Belts* down.
I mean like *hoses* down. Rain so heavy it's a little scary.
Violent enough that you just stand there, in awe, and just watch it.
I'm swearing a little under my breath.
In *minutes* the gutters are overflowing. Not long after that the whole street is a river of water doing its best to find a drain. And *still* it keeps coming on, maybe even a little harder.
Then the lightning and the thunder, *real* close.
Then it starts blowing its arse off.
You'd think it was the fucking apocalypse...
I guess I'm staying here the night then...
---
Got a message from mum. She’s not doing well.
Pretty frantic.
Pleading for me to get out.
Gives me the shits.
She doesn't just want me out of Nigeria, but out of Africa.
Apparently, Ebola and the Boko Haram are both making international news.
Mum is taking it all to heart.
To top it off, in the local newspaper back home the front page was dedicated entirely to the story of a man who was held hostage for nine months in Nigeria.
*Great timing, that...*
Mum has every right to be concerned. But sharks are scarier from the boat than they are from in the water. Odd but true. I don't know why that is, but it is.
I'm more concerned about the murdering I copped last night from a pack of ravenous mosquitoes, who were unleashed when the ceiling fan (ceiling fans seem to confound mosquitoes) cut out when the power died in the middle of the night. Fuckers.
Anyway, I've gotta get my visa. I fucking better... I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't work out; this is the end of the line...
I'm buzzing as I walk to the outskirts of town to find the Embassy.
---
Well, it's a far cry from not even being allowed in the front door in Lagos...
They're very accommodating, and not at all demanding.
It never felt in doubt...
In about fifteen minutes I'm back out the front door, surprised to have a three-month visa for 125 bucks.
*I'll make that deal.*
I can leave Nigeria...
*Thank fuck for that.*
I grab a late and shitty breakfast at about 11 o’clock - three bananas and some peanuts – I’m bloody hungry.
I offload my backpack at the hotel and then head for walkies through the local market. It’s par-for-the-course, with fabrics, fresh produce and horrendous butcheries with blokes slamming huge hunks of animal with machetes, splattering me in the process.
Snails must be a local delicacy here because they’re for sale everywhere. They have shells like the top of one of the towers of La Sagrada Familia. Different!
The ground at the market still hasn't dried from last night’s rain, and I can feel the mud squishing through the plugs in my thongs and into the gaps between my toes.
*Disconcerting.*
Other than the markets, I'm *loving* the outdoor, open air hairdressers. Women are fenced off like cattle and three or four hairdressers go to work on them like a pit crew. It's a spectator sport.
There are a lot of people half-heartedly trying to get my attention today. I just mentally pretend that I'm French; like don’t know a word of English.
Mostly people are just giving me the usual "white man!" as I walk past; more as a statement of fact rather than being attention seeking or derogatory.
The markets don't capture my attention for long, so I head back "home" to the hotel for a siesta.
Tomorrow's a big day...

## Chapter Thirty Eight
Must be playing on my mind...
I’m up, at 6:30 in the morning, unassisted.
Odd.
That’s got to be some sort of record for me...
Well. Good. Might as well get to it...
---
Without anyone to say goodbye to at the hotel I get going at the ripe time of 7:30 - surely another record, I’m not usually even awake yet...
It’s not raining. But it’s pretty friggin ominous. Dark. But maybe that’s just the morning...
I'm quickly off the main road, and onto the road that should take me to the border - I think...
It’s crappy tarmac full of big, deep potholes full of deep water.
That’s no problem for me on two wheels - easily dodged - but the cars and trucks are having a 'mare of it.
---
There’s a fork in the road, it splits out like a wedge, one heading left, one heading right.
Wasn’t expecting that...
I bury my head in the GPS while still rolling, trying to pick one.
The left!
*Bang, bang!*
Woops! Didn’t see that speedbump. Big one too...
There’s yelling coming from my left, I turn my head to see a big bloke taking big, purposeful strides towards me and the bike, *just a few meters away*.
Then he's in my mirrors.
He’s running after me!
Yelling and waving... That's a plank of wood in his hand! *A stickman!!* 
*Ha!*
Sorry mate, not a fucking chance...
I gun the bike and slowly extend the gap. *See ya!*
Down the left of the wedge it’s all new tarmac. Brand *spanking* new.
---
Single lane track, and it’s green all around.
I pass some plantations, some wild stuff - canopying over the road overhead, creating a beautiful, dark, green, tunnel.
*Gorgeous.*
I feel like I’m in nature’s version of a pillow fort; somewhere that feels secret and secure and safe.
The road is forever twisting and turning, going up or down, conforming to the hilly terrain, with the peaks of the hills shrouded in fast moving cloud, getting whisked along with me to Cameroon.
It’s a beautiful ride.
*Bliss...*
Then I pass a dirty big industrial plant or a mine or something. It couldn't be more out keeping with the vibe.
Riding past the man-made-shit, the tarmac road disappears into a red dirt track.
Figures...
Things slow down, but besides the occasional puddle it’s actually not too bad.
What was left of the traffic - if you could call it that - evaporates. All that’s left is me and the occasional small roadside village.
I'll be buggered if I know what they do for a crust out here, this remote.
After I've passed a few I start to notice a pattern emerging; half are very friendly - all waves and smiles and welcoming; I wave and smile back; the other half I leave angry yelling in my wake...
I don't get it; whole groups of people gesturing *furiously* from their houses, "PSSSSST!"ing their heads off.
Of course, I never stop for this type of shit, but I do wonder just what they're getting at.
Do they want me to buy something?
Or maybe just want to have a chat?
Or are they going to hassle me?
*Or worse?*
My biggest concern is that it's legit; maybe some sort of checkpoint or police stop or even a border post where they want to check my papers, where I probably *should* stop to get stamped...
I dunno.
My way of dealing with it is to ignore it. The moment that I hear anyone making a "PSSSSST!" noise at me I don't even look in their direction. Trouble with that is that I can't look at them for clues as to what the fuck they're driving at...
In any case, good riddance to those guys. I’m sure that it can’t be good news, right?
Also, I'm not a huge fan of having *"WHITE MAN!!"* yelled at me.
Shits me.
Kids are exempt, I guess; *they’re* yelling it in pure, unbridled excitement; kind of in the same way that kids might yell *"SANTA!!"*.
As I ponder it I nearly hit a spike strip laid out over the road...
*Stickman!*
It's a very agricultural looking spike strip - planks of wood connected together with rope. The spikes are rusty nails...
*Fuck!* Gotta be a stickman...
Fuck fuck fuck. The spikes cover up the whole of the road; there’s no way around...
I have to stop.
*Shit shit shit shit shit...*
A bloke materialises from out of the green.
*Rough lookin...*
Fuck!
What do I do??
He grabs the rope and moves the spike strip away...
“Where are you going?”
“Um, the border? The border.”
He waves me on.
I ride through.
That was unexpected...
*Weird,* even.
He didn’t even ask me for my papers...
Come to think of it, I haven’t been asked for my papers *once* in all of Nigeria. Not once. How about that? In fact, that’s gotta be a first for *any* country I’ve been to. Go figure.
On the other side of the spikes the red dirt paths turn into steep slopes of really thick, really slippery, red mud.
You can see where all the cars and bikes have had a go at it - deep tyre tracks gouged out of the red clay.
The gentle, thin rain, has given it all the traction of a bar of soap.
It’s a goddamn mess.
---
Progress comes to a stop...
*Slow.*
Each incline, I have to sit for a bit at the bottom of it, size it up, pick my favourite track - or the least worst track - and roll the dice.
The level of control I have over where the bike goes and what it does is purely that of light suggestion, gentle persuasion - the bike is its own animal in this shit - and I’ve just got to let it go where it will, and try my best to keep it rubber side down.
Despite my so called “experience” the bike is still all over the shop, jumping from one rut to another - going exactly where I don’t want the bloody thing to go - moving sideways under me, *very* suddenly, in ways I’m not ready for.
At least twice I should have binned it; it was only by pure luck - not skill - that everything stayed upright.
It's white knuckled shit.
Fucking exhausting.
---
Bang on midday, almost to the second, and I roll into the Nigerian border post at a place called Ekang.
*Made it.*
Already I’m thrilled by my luck at getting an early start this morning; I’m halfway through the day but not close to halfway through what needs to be done to get to the next lot of civilisation.
Rocking up here a couple of hours from now would have been a shit outcome...
I don’t know why they’ve bothered to give this place a name; *there’s nothing here.*
I pull up at a building that looks like it could be something... It's more promising than the other ramshackle looking constructions.
The whole place is deserted.
I jump off the bike and pull my helmet off, and a fat man in his underwear appears from somewhere and tells me that I need to keep going further.
Right...
---
I hit a chained and padlocked wooden gate, barring my path to a bridge crossing over a small stream. *This must be the place...*
It takes me a while to find Immigration; it’s just a white washed building with "Immigration" drawn onto it in tiny letters above the door.
There’s two of blokes lazing around in casual dress inside.
They’re friendly enough, but they don't seem to have a very good handle on what needs to be done. It’s pretty obvious that not many people use this border crossing...
It takes a long time to fill in the required books and ledgers, and I notice that before the guy thwacks my passport he has to wind his stamp forward *three days* first... Yeah, *remote*.
With that done I ask them how I get the gate unlocked. But instead they handball me to some other guy. Buggered if I know what his job is...
We sit down and I hand him my passport, as asked.
He opens a blank notebook to its blank first page(!) and starts taking down my passport details. Painfully slowly. Like watching a six year old write...
Passport Number.
Name.
Surname.
Date of birth.
Place of birth.
Date of Issue.
Date of Expiry.
Issuing Authority...
I’m surprised he’s not going to try to sketch my passport photo…
He turns to me.
"Where have you stayed in Nigeria?"
*What?*
"All over."
"Which hotels?"
"Which hotels?? I don’t remember the names. Why is that important?"
"What dates?"
"Dates? I don’t know... Why do you need to know?"
“I am doing my job.”
He turns to the first page of my passport and starts heavily scrutinising my Benin visa. He spends about ten seconds, carefully reading it before I stop him.
"I'll show you where my Nigerian visa is..." I go to grab the passport.
"No, I want to see *this* one..."
I don’t get it. What’s this bloke on about?
He starts writing down the details of my stay in *Benin*...
*What??*
Does he think that because my Benin visa is the first visa in my passport that it’s the first place that I’ve visited?? Fucking peanut.
“Hey, I don't get it, why is my Benin visa important? What use is this for Nigeria?”
He ignores me.
“Where did you start?”
“England.”
“Where is the stamp?”
“What?? *Why?* That’s not important. There isn’t one.”
“What’s the first stamp?"
“Ugh. Morocco...”
“Where is the stamp?”
“How am I supposed to know!?”
I turn the pages of the passport while he’s still holding it. “See all these countries?” I say, “See all these stamps? If we’re going to match every entry-stamp to every exit-stamp to every visa in this whole passport we’ll be here all *year*. I’ve no idea which ones are for which countries. They’re all over the place. And it’s *not* important. Do you understand? *None of this* is important to Nigeria. I’ve been all over Africa (liar…) and no one has *ever* asked me questions like this. No one. *Ever*.”
He sort of trails off after this. And I think we’re done here. I re-take the initiative. “Do you mind if I see the passport for a second? I just want to see if there’s space for the Cameroon stamp...”
Of course there is... The ploy works. He hands me back the passport and I thumb through it, thoughtfully. I mock-brighten-up “Ah, *yes!* There’s room for a stamp right here. *Perfect!*” I put the passport back into my jacket pocket. The guy looks a little lost. “Thank you so much for your time, you've been a great help and I really appreciate it.” He bewilderedly shakes my hand.
I exit stage left.
*Clever...*
Walking out of the building I smell food, and that's good enough for me; who knows how far I'll have to go till I find food in Cameroon.
I find the local chop by following my nose and wolf down some rice with fish and sauce.
Back at the border gate there are a couple of new blokes "PSSST!"ing at me from outside the Immigration. I ignore them. As far as I'm concerned, we're done here...
A third guy, an ancient bloke, comes up to me and asks me if I’ve seen Customs.
“Yes, yes it’s all done...”
But, the gate is still locked.
No choice, I guess.
They’re sitting outside a locked door with 'Customs' written on it, but that doesn’t mean that they *are* Customs, if you get me. Could be two random blokes just looking for some dash...
“Carnet.”
“I have a laissez passer.”
“Give it to me.”
“Let’s go inside first.” I figure if he can undo that lock then that’ll make it legit enough for me...
“Why do you want to go inside the office?”
“I’d be more comfortable.”
Sure enough, he has the keys.
*Tick.*
We all head inside.
They check my LP and hand it back and say that I can go.
As they’re unlocking the gate for me I apologise to them for trying to ignore them and being a douchebag.
I roll over the bridge and over the stream.
Nigeria; *In the can.*
And I still have my ears...
Never did I ever dream that it would have been as easy as this. Is Nigeria easy? Or was I just lucky?
I'll never know...
---
Cameroon.
*Off to a bad start...*
The Customs office on the Cameroon side of the river is derelict and deserted.
Not too sure what to do about that...
I carry on up the road a bit and see a uniformed police officer taking a slash into the trees.
I park up the bike.
He walks over and puts his hand out. I shake it - trying not to think that he’s just touched his cock with that hand. I hope he didn’t get piss on it. Or has herpes... That gives you an idea of how important the handshake is here; you really can't not do it...
*Anyway.* He speaks English but it's obvious he prefers French. Cameroon is a weird country. I think that half the people speak English and the other half speak French. It's a bit like Canada, except it's nothing like Canada...
We switch to French.
In his pile-o-shit office he explains (I think...) that he can't issue a LP here, but he does stamp me into the country.
He tells me (I think...) where I can find Customs.
It’s in one ear and out the other...
Somewhere further down the track, I suppose.
The whole thing takes longer than it ought to, but in the end I’m lucky to ride into Cameroon with zero paperwork for the bike - he could have easily said to me: "no paperwork, no good, go back.”
But, *I'm in.*
---
Straightaway things are different here.
The road has turned from a mud rush into gorgeous, pebbled, single lane track with green pressed in on all sides. I can reach out in any direction and touch green.
I feel like I'm in a secret again.
The sun’s come out through the thin rain and streaks in beams through the trees.
There’s a magic intimacy to it. I’ve never seen a track like it...
But with intimacy comes remoteness. As time passes, it becomes increasingly obvious that the Cameroonian side of the border is even more sparsely populated than the Nigerian side.
And when I say more sparsely populated, I mean no one at all.
Not a soul. No signs of life. Except for the life of the forest, or is it a jungle now?
Botanical definitions aside, if something goes wrong out here, I’m sort of fucked. No one’s going to come to help. I’m just stuck. And what then?
Not worth thinking about; I'm making good progress.
But I can still feel it pressing on me; the risk.
There’s, what, about sixty clicks to go?
Sixty clicks at a touch over walking pace... Wait. How fast could I walk sixty clicks?? Ten hours. Minimum.
*Shit...* This is reminding me of Mali-ville way back in Guinea, where we took two days to do a route that we though would take us a morning.
Except this time, I'm alone...
*Yuck.*
---
The pebble path gives way back into a fucking mud rush.
We slow right down to a crawl.
*Mud mud mud.*
We're sliding all over the place again.
It's the kind of clayish mud that you stick your boot into and you'll lose it up to the shins. Try pulling your foot out and that's all you'll get, a foot; the boot stays in the mud...
*Sucky*, thick, sticky mud.
It’s knackering.
There are puddles all over the place. I try my best to avoid them; they make a mess. But sometimes there's no getting around them.
*Gotta go though.*
I come up to one, a lighter shade of the colour mud. It's about as long as I can kick a football...
I pick the least shit of the two possible paths and hit it as fast as I dare.
Halfway through and I'm making a mess, and then the bike just fucking *disappears* on me; like I rode off a cliff; the front wheel dives deep into the water and the back one follows it in a moment later. I hold onto the handlebars like a goddamn rodeo cowboy.
"*FUCK!!*"
The loud bang of the exhaust note turns into a bubbly dribble as it goes under, but we keep going forward - and down.
I wring the throttle. *If I lose momentum we're fucked.*
We're making a wake like a boat. Any deeper and it's gonna suck water and we're *proper* fucked...
*Make it make it make it make it!* Come on!
The bike rises like Lazarus out of the water and the bubbling dribble turns into a coughing bang again and we’re out the other end, *soaking* wet.
Jagged one there. *Bigtime.*
Shit; I hope that didn’t flood into my bags...
I hit another big puddle. I spot a big fuck off tree branch in the way after I'm already committed to the tyre rut.
Can't avoid it! No stopping, no turning, no avoiding, just go.
*Foomp-Whack-Thunk-Crack!!*
Foomp! The stick goes under the front tyre. 
Whack! With the sheared off pointy end coming flying through the crashbars of the bike.
Thunk! Right into the meaty part of my shin.
Crack! The thick part of the tree branch gets fulcrum-ed in the crash bars and then snaps off like snapping a twig with your thumbs...
I come out the other side dragging half a tree branch with me.
I check my leg; another few inches of tree and the pointy end would have gone clean through my calf.
Impaled.
Speared.
*Still hurts like hell...*
No damage though; bike's fine too; branch could have gone whack-thunking into anything...
Dead-bike and dead-me probably mean about the same thing right now...
We crack on at a crawl. What else am I going to do?
Clayish red slippery *shit.*
I can’t relax for a single moment.
The bike won’t sit still for a second.
Every moment is a chance that the bike could disappear from underneath me and send us for a sprawl in the mud.
---
*Hours...*
We've covered twenty odd clicks from the border; that's taken, roughly, three hours.
That's no more than a brisk walking pace...
I’ve got maybe twenty more to go before I get off this track and onto something more “well healed”. *Looking forward to that...*
*Tonk!!!*
That's coming from the bike... 
*Tonk! Tonk! Tonk! Tonk!...*
I can *feel* it.
*Tonk! Tonk!...*
No no no no I've killed it...
*Tonk!...*
It’s definitely not a good sound.
*Tonk!...*
Definitely a bad sound.
*Tonk!...*
Fuck this is going to end badly.
I stop.
The tonking stops when I kill the switch.
I vault off the bike. Give it a good looking over...
*Nothing...*
Besides everything being coated in a thick layer of mud there’s nothing obvious that's out of place; nor is there anything obviously there that *shouldn't* be, like a tree through the wheel spokes...
*What do I do?*
There's no fucking choice, is there?
I start it up again.
*Tonk!*
Still there.
I go.
---
I stop. I look. I start. I go.
I stop. I look. I start. I go.
*I fret...*
It’s worse in first gear. *Louder.*
Which says what??
*I’m not a bloody mechanic...*
It *feels* like it's something inside the engine. Or the gearbox, or whatever.
Do I go faster, or slower?
I can't slow my breathing down.
*I can't lose the bike out here...*
---
I'm ready to snap.
I hit yet another puddle; I nearly drown it again...
Out the other side and the clank has disappeared.
Gone completely.
*"What the fuck!?"*
I don't get it...
---
I spot the first soul I’ve seen out here since the border.
Two souls, in fact. I’ve caught them up. It’s a man and a kid, "two-up" on a plastic Chinese 125cc pile of shit.
The kid on the back is carrying a shitload of bananas. They look like they’ve just cut the branch off a banana tree and are bringing the whole lot back home; all the bananas still attached in groups to the main branch. There must be a hundred bloody bananas on that thing...
Can they really have been doing the same road that I’ve been doing? Two-up with a shitload of bananas?
*How is that even possible?*
The moment that we meet eyes from either side of a massive bog of mud, I'm trying to jump up a small incline.
I beach the exhaust on the mound of mud to the side, and it takes all of the weight off the back wheel and I'm going nowhere. I can’t move, not forwards, backwards or sideways. The back wheel spins uselessly.
Beached.
My banana buddies come over to help me out.
*Lucky as fuck;* I wouldn't have even been a *chance* to get it out without them there.
*Outrageously* lucky, in fact...
What are the odds?
If I wasn’t an atheist I would no doubt be thanking someone upstairs right now...
Even with my new mates, it’s a big effort in the thick mud; it’s a heavy bike, on a steep gradient, and the mud is sucking back every one of our efforts to lift it out of the shit. Not to mention it’s slick enough for our legs sink in but thick enough to hold them in too.
In spite of my boots I can feel the Cameroonian jungle mud sliding between my toes...
It’s a gruelling, exhausting effort to shift the bastard thing - Royal Enfields are fucking *solid* - but we get it done.
My banana buddies ask for 500CFA for their troubles.
*Capitalists.*
That's a touch over $1.
I don’t have any CFA yet, so I give him my Naira instead, which I’m sure he can exchange. I give him 1000 of them, which is about seven bucks.
He makes seven times more than he wanted, I get out of a nightmare.
*Great deal.*
---
We ride on “ensemble”. It's awesome to have a wingman, and I feel more chilled about the prospects for the day already.
Not much further down the way I end up getting beached again.
Again, the banana buddies help me out.
Again, it’s hard work.
I’m *covered* in mud, head to toe, and sweating like no one’s business.
The bike looks amazing though. Absolutely covered in shit. The real deal! Righteous!
There's *never* been a better looking motorcycle than this thing looks right now.
Despite being absolutely fragged, I've got to smile; this is all so wonderfully ridiculous.
---
Finally, *finally* I pop out onto the main road.
We're filthy, but unscathed; well, except my shin...
The main road is tarmac. Crappy, *glorious* tarmac.
There’s a unit of Gendarmes here at the crossroads, and I take the risk of asking them where Customs are, even if it reveals to them that I probably don't have the correct papers...
They point me off up the tarmac main road I probably should have taken to get here; back West in the direction of Nigeria...
*Nope.*
I don't want to re-live the going backwards to a border-post balls-up that happened in Senegal...
Plus, I’m tired, and I’ve no desire to be going in the “wrong” direction; adding clicks onto my already long day.
I just want to lie flat somewhere.
I ask them if there’s any Customs in the village at *Mamfe*, the village I had my eyes on to spend the night.
There is!
The Gendarmes, to their credit, let me go with no questions asked.
After a bit of shitty road the awful clanking tonking sound comes back... I don't need this...
Then I hit beautiful Chinese tarmac.
Flawless, magnificent, Chinese ‘mac.
I could fucking *kiss* it.
Say what you like about the Chinese and their African shenanigans, they make a damn fine road.
---
Checkpoints. Loads of them. I’m always waved through.
The tonking stops.
I hit Mamfe.
Job: *Done.*
Two hundred and twenty one clicks; one border crossing; eight and a half hours.
*I've earned sleep.*

## Chapter Thirty Nine
My bags are full of mud.
Everything’s gonna need a wash.
One of my bags has got a massive tear along its underbelly. Dunno how that happened... I'm lucky it didn't gastro my stuff out all over the road.
Gotta get that fixed.
It’s outrageously hot and humid today.
In fact, I don’t even reckon it’s that hot. Just mad humid.
Jungle humid.
I step out of my room onto the back balcony (yeah, I've got a fuckin balcony). I’ve got a stunning view of the massive *Cross River*. Within seconds I can see small wet, red splotches all down the front of my old pink t-shirt (that used to be red), the dots turn into streaks in minutes. Not much later and it’s *saturated* with sweat.
*Not a good look.*
---
Morning.
I hit the streets.
Despite the never ending stream of "WHITEMAN!" that I cop - and not being able to pin whether the language here is French or English - I still kinda like Mamfe.
I hit-up breakfast. Black beans with rice; The best I reckon I’ve ever had - and I've had my fair share.
Sometimes it’s the little things in life...
While I’m chowing down about 50 cents worth for breakfast, I watch some blokes hauling thick bundles of long, awkward, heavy-as-fuck iron re-bar for concrete support from out of the back of a truck.
Doing the lion’s share of the work is maybe the strongest bloke I reckon I’ve *ever* seen.
You’ve never seen nothing like this guy. Not in your life.
Of middling height, with a bulging pot belly on him that - somehow - is covered in a painted-on looking, *monstrous* six-pack.
*Or is it an eight pack??*
His arms are two lengths of wound bridge steel. *Ripped* as fuck. Or at least some mad combination of being fat and ripped to shreds at the same time.
I don’t get how it works.
He's a human lump of pure, functional strength.
This guy’s never even heard of a gym, yet he’s picking up *bundles* of steel re-bar the way I’d pick up a pile of sticks, walking to the edge of the truck tray, and then just *chucking* it.
It’s awe inspiring.
It looks like he’s been throwing re-bar around since he first started walking.
And here I am, working up a sweat by lifting a spoon of beans to my face.
There’s a lesson to be learned about desk jobs in there somewhere... I’m sure of it...
Anyway, enough of that.
---
After some Marco Polo with the locals I find the Customs building for the village.
The chief bloke is an albino.
Albinos are everywhere here. Surprisingly common, and some more proof to add to the "there is no god" pile.
It's just fucking cruel.
How do they do it?
It’s a very strange thing to behold; pure black features plastered over with pinky white skin, covered in blemishes and freckles from the brutal hard sun here.
Anyway, we've been talking for a while and my new mate is a little confused about what I’m driving at, but he’s happy to oblige me anyway, and tells me that they’ll get someone to bring me an LP from the border, and he can write it up for me tomorrow morning.
*Good stuff.*
---
Back home and over to the bike.
It looks like shit.
I washed it yesterday with some really “hard” water. When I say "hard", I mean the kind of water that you find at the bottom of your kettle - all full of calcified who-knows-what. I then left it out in last night’s rain in the hope that the clean rain would rinse off the calcifications, and some more of the mud.
*Nope.*
Just a lot of rust.
The chain copped it worse than most. It's fucked... I give it a drenching in grease for its trouble.
For reasons of physics that I don’t understand, after getting greased up the chain slackness tightens - *a lot*.
Very odd, but I’ll take it as a win; the chain has been "slapping" with looseness a bit lately, and was due for a tightening. Now I don't have to bother.
I swear, this bike mends itself...
My spidey senses are telling me that this chain’s at the end of its tether... Other than that, I’ve done nothing to fix the “tonking” problem. I’ll just cross my fingers and hope that it mends itself too.
Rain, hail or shine, I have to crack on tomorrow.
Fingers crossed that the weather clears up...

## Chapter Fourty
*It does.*
I wake up to a cool, fresh morning.
There’s a crisp edge to the air, which is like a tonic after the wet, stifling, draining humidity.
Conditions don’t get better than this.
I head to Customs and pick up the LP from my albino buddy with no dramas, and it's off to the next major village down the line, Bamenda.
---
The "N6" is deadset glorious.
Absolutely *immaculate*.
The white, painted-on road markings don’t look like they’ve dried yet; it's that fresh.
After yesterday’s mud bath this was exactly what I needed.
I’ve got it all to myself.
Fuck I love this...
Black underneath, light green on the sides and the "Toy Story" white and blue backdrop overhead.
There are butterflies *everywhere*. In places the sky is *thick* with the colour of them.
It’s friggin gorgeous.
If I was a painter I’d paint this.
The road is alive. It’s moving constantly as we undulate up and down and around the hills and mountains.
The bike is singing to me, music in my ears. I’m singing too. And grinning like a maniac.
I can’t help it.
My spontaneous happiness is mirrored in the spontaneous, easy happiness of the Cameroonians, and as I chug through the small roadside villages there’s always a big white smile and a friendly wave to reflect mine.
This place. Magnificent.
This bike. *Perfect.*
I'm in love.
I'm in fucking *love*.
This is what it’s all about; I’m riding a Royal Enfield through the mountains of Cameroon... *Cameroon!* Who the fuck gets to *do* this shit??
*Outrageous.*
If for nothing else other than this day, this *moment*, it’s *all* been worth it.
---
The dense rain forest starts to give way to a sort of a balding process, and the dark green trees give out to grasslands.
*Have we put on some altitude then?* Must have...
I’m coming out of another friendly small village when I notice three or four women on the side of the road up ahead doing some sort of wild rain dance around an old car wreck.
*This is new...*
They’re flinging their arms around in the air with stick brushes. Dancing about and making a hell of a lot of noise. Wailing away.
A dance of remembrance? *How weird...*
They're dancing in the direction of a car that's on its roof; it's come off the side of the road down a small embankment.
I see someone getting pulled out of one of the smashed windows...
Holy *fuck*!
I feel my face and back fizz with a dump of adrenaline, and steel myself to witness some gnarly shit.
This is fresh. *Very* fresh; I must've missed the crash by *seconds*...
I jump off the bike and run over to the upside down car. There are three old ladies lying on the road. They aren't mangled up like I was expecting, but they also aren't moving about a bunch either.
*I don't want anything to do with this...*
So I run away. Back to the bike.
I have an instinct that there was a hospital back in the village I just passed... A red cross... I *feel* like I saw one. *Maybe...*
I fly back to the village.
---
I was right.
I hit the skids as I slide up to the front doors of the village hospital.
I run through the front doors, *yelling.*
Adrenaline fuelled ranting.
I run up and down the halls yelling at the top of my lungs for help.
Nurses and doctors come out of the woodwork.
I direct them down the road.
The nurses are moving quickly with a sense of purpose.
The doctors want to wait for a bus...
*A bus???*
"It's just up the road! It’s right *there*! You can walk there! People are hurt, could be *dead!!*" I try to create some sense of urgency but the doctors don’t seem to give a shit.
With nothing left to do I jump back on the bike to show the running nurses the way to the wreck.
---
In the time I’ve been away a big mob has formed.
I peer through to where everything’s happening; down the embankment where the wreck is.
Everyone's *fine.* A little shaken up, sure, but they're fine...
*Unbelievable.*
I feel a little sheepish for having panicked - badly. I'm embarrassed for making a fuss...
I hotstep back to the bike and tear out of there.
*What was I supposed to do?* The car was on it's fucking *roof.*
The adrenaline wears off, and my hands stop their tremble.
I quickly forget about it, and go back to enjoying this superb ride.

## Chapter Fourty One
Up in the morning to the best meal I’ve had in a long time, followed by running into a man wheeling a coffee cart.
It’s looking like being my lucky day.
Bamenda’s been ok.
The place is nestled in the bottom of a bowl of mountains. Very pretty, and the air is cool and fresh. It's the first place in months that I haven’t sweated a single drop. It’s a wonderful change.
I couldn't find food last night. Ended up having to eat at a bar... Cold cassava and some cold brown sauce with a sad looking, cold fish.
The fish looked like it'd had a hard life - and an even harder afterlife. Better than nothing, but not by much. I was scared it wouldn't be long till I saw it again - albeit at a higher velocity - but it all worked out ok.
The night was *freezing* cold. My face was eaten my mosquitoes. Fucking malaria *fuckers*...
Anyway.
We're out of town with a full tank of juice.
We climb the switchbacks out of the bowl of mountains, and then climb some more on the other side of that...
We’re off to Kumbo; there's a "ring road" out there that I've been told is worth a look.
The ‘mac’s not anywhere near yesterday’s standards, but that’s ok. It’s not bad at all. Passable, even.
The foggy morning slowly gets baked off by the warmth of the sun, and the grassy green hills are revealed in all their glory.
Kumbo’s not far, so I take it steady and I just soak it all in.
Time seems to be flying by... Go figure.
---
There's no doubting we're at altitude now...
It feels strange; being cold.
It's the kind of cold where your breath fogs... Unbelievable; we're a stone’s throw from the equator, in *Africa*, and my breath is fogging.
Bizarre...
I don't relish the idea of tonight’s shower though...
That ring road around here that I've been told to have a go at looks like it will take a couple of days to go full circle, and given the remoteness I'd probably have to camp out. So I've decided to *can* it; I don't have the spurs to do it by myself. I've had mixed reports on its condition, and I don't relish the idea of being stuck in my tent while I fucking freeze to death.
---
Morning.
Even though it was pretty filthy in my bed, I still didn't want to leave it's smelly warmth...
I boycott the icy shower because I’m a pansy.
*Grubby* is how I'd describe myself.
On the way to breakfast there are a couple of lads sinking beers at one of the shacks. *It’s 8:30 in the morning...*
Righto...
I hit a random restaurant and order breakfast.
It's *epic.*
A huge serving of rice and beans and green sauce with a massive slab of meat - tender as it gets - *and* the top half of what was once a big fish.
*Breakfast of champions.*
Friggin delicious.
At 700CFA it’s a bit exxy for breakfast (that's a touch under a couple of dollars), but the size justifies the spend.
I don't know what it is with me these days but when food is put in front of me I just *inhale* it. I barely chew. I've got no idea why it always feels so *rushed*, almost *panicked*. I eat so fast I make myself feel sick. It's stupid, but I can't stop it for some reason...
---
Today’s plan is to follow the GPS directions a straight shot south via a place called Foumbot to a final destination of Bafoussam, which would take me past a lake, which should be nice.
To double check my plan I ask my hotel host what the best way to go to Bafoussam is.
“First you go Bamenda, *this* way, then from Bamenda you go Bafoussam.”
*What??*
“What?”
“First you go Bamenda, this…”
“Yeah yeah yeah, got it, but what about Foumbot, anyone go that way?”
“No no no. No one goes that way. First, you go Bamenda...”
Shit. That’s a massive detour back to where I've just come from. It must mean that the road straight to Bafoussam is a pile of shit...
It's weird, I feel relieved and pissed off at the same time.
Mostly it's disappointing. I've already copped out of one adventure today, now I'm copping out of another one...
That said, getting into Cameroon was adventure enough, and I'm glad to have done that much at least.
Often, when I'm on the bike, I think of how much of an "adventure" Africa is these days, compared to days gone by, and days to come.
My guess is that Africa will soon be well developed and won’t present the same adventure as it does today.
I wonder though: *have I already missed the boat?*
Is Africa already sanitised and relatively easy compared to the unavoidable adventure that it must have been one or two decades ago?
Of course it must be.
The adventurers of yesteryear would think that my "adventure" is a cakewalk...
But, for my two cents, I reckon that now is a fantastic time to overland Africa; it’s Goldilocks.
One or two decades ago it would have been gnarly as hell - *all* the time. No respite. No fun. No choice.
In another decade - once everywhere's been ‘mac’d by the Chinese - it will be easy as pie.
I think right now you've got adventure when and where you want it. You don't have to go very far to find it. You can be as sedate or as hardcore as you like.
Today, I guess, is going to be that in a nutshell. I’ve got two roads I can take: One known and easy, the other unknown and potentially a nightmare/amazing.
The real question is this: Do I feel like being surprised today?
*No.* Not really.
It's curious how useful a bit of ignorance can be as a seed for adventure. If someone had of shown me photos of the mudbath I was in a few days ago I would have used a different border. No questions asked. If today I hadn't of asked around about how to get to Bafoussam I would have taken the hard road without realising it.
Tough choices, but, at the end of the day, I'm cruising through Cameroon on a Royal Enfield; it's enough.
---
Bafoussam.
I zoomed clean through Bamenda.
The swarms of butterflies, which are like the eighth plague of Egypt, have gone from being pleasurable to being a colourful carnage. I must be killing *hundreds* of them.
Slaughterhouse.
Bafoussam is not a likeable place; it’s a village that's just a little bit too big for itself. Too busy and dirty. No character or colour.
I have another really, *really* shit lunch; It’s a huge plate of rice with a separate plate of a sort of creamy oily sauce with a more cold-than-warm mystery meat. The creamy greasy sauce has danger written all over it.
It's incredible what my gut can put up with these days; not so long ago and shit like this would have blown a hole in my pants in seconds...
Cameroon is odd. This restaurant is a perfect example in miniature: In the one corner talking away in English, and in the other corner they're jabbering away in French. Occasionally they'll throw salvos at one another from across the language barrier; It's clear they don't like one another.
It must be so divisive not to be able to talk to your own countryman. What a mad situation.
Colonialism gone weird.
Back at the hotel with nothing to do, I start thinking about what happens post-Africa. I used to lean heavily towards shipping everything home and being done with it; South America and the world could wait. But now, here, in Cameroon, with Nigeria in the mirrors, it's the opposite; I've swung firmly back into travelling mode.
When I'm not waking up in the morning scared shitless, thinking "holy shit I've got to ride the bike today", I feel like I could keep doing this travelling thing indefinitely.
And you know what? There's a long way to go but I'll be done with Africa pretty promptly; from here on south there's not going to be so much fucking about with bureaucracy at Consulates and Embassies. All of the fiddly little countries of West Africa are behind me; all that's left are the biggens of Central and Southern Africa. *Big* countries. And I don't have any particular reason to stay for a long time in any of them... It should make for some fast travelling;
without the usual distractions I could be at the bottom in three or four months.
I'll be there before I know it...
---
Last night's omelette dinner didn’t *seem* dodgy... And I don’t *feel* crook...
But then why is this my *third* shit for the morning?
*That ain’t normal...*
Maybe it's yesterday's creamy lunch and mystery meats?
Well... Do I stick around here another day to let it settle? It’s tempting... Or do I roll the dice, hit the road, and maybe have one or two (or three?) loose moments in the jungle?
*Fuck it*. Bafoussam is a hole. I want to leave.
I'll trust my gut to handle it. I’ll back it in. Let’s have breakfast and see where that lands...
---
Off to my omelette buddy from last night; in the hustle and bustle of the market.
Again, it’s top notch; deep fried pasta omelette. Fucking delicious. I wash it down with a condensed milk coffee. Good stuff.
Oh. Shit...
"SHIT!!"
I throw money at the chef and I *run.*
Christ no. No no no no.
Agh! No!
Don't run. Walk... Walkwalkwalk.
*I'm going to shit everywhere.*
Jeeesus fucking eff.
I squeeze. Hard. And walk. Slowly...
---
*Whoosh.*
There goes number four...
*I made it.*
I didn't think I would, but I did.
Without being too graphic, I reckon that’s all of it. If it wasn't then I’ll be shitting my organs out next.
I think I can still risk it.
I want out of this shitheap.
*Crack on.*

## Chapter Fourty Two
It's another beautiful ride through the green. The road has switched from crappy to perfect, and my mind free-wheels as it's given its reins.
Humour me; I'm going to talk about what's going on in my head...
Don't worry, it'll be a short chapter (zing).
So. Here's what I think about when I'm riding.
My mate Victor Hugo (I'm chewing through *Les Miserables*) has told me off for thinking that *reverie* and *thinking* are the same things. Apparently they’re not. So I’m going to be more careful to make the distinction. I reckon that what I mostly do on the bike is *think*.
It’s some deep and profound shit.
All day I’m coming up with gems. Pearls of wisdom; left, right and centre.
I'd love to tell you what they are. Fuck, *I'd* love to know what they are; yet the moment, the *instant,* that I get off the bike is like the moment I wake up from a dream, and what was so vivid and clear just a moment ago is now a vague shadow, or nothing at all. It just fucking *evaporates.* Even as I clutch at it.
I think so much on that bike; *way* more than any other time of the day.
I reckon that it’s my muse. So I’ve decided to name it *“The Shrike”*.
I’ve pulled the name from a sci-fi novel I’ve just finished reading called *Hyperion*. The Shrike is an epic, singular creature made out of metal spikes. It kills people for fun...
It doesn’t *seem* apt as a name, *sure*, but I like it because it was the muse of one of the main characters in the book, and my Shrike is my metal muse; the inspiration for all of my best thoughts.
I’m also not sure that it's apt, as the main character was - spoiler alert - killed (and brutally) by the Shrike in the book, but let’s not get too into the details...
I just like it.
Voilà; I told you it would be a short chapter.
Today it's been a little hard to think; butterflies exploding in your eyes at 80 clicks can bump you out of your train of thought.
The poor demented fuckers then get wedged somewhere in my helmet around my ears, and flap and squirm frantically like a fish out of water in their death throes. All of this happening *on* my face. I’ve gotta pull over, all the time, to get the bloody things out.
I get stopped for the first time at a checkpoint. They're pretty toothless - despite wanting to see *everything*. They even accept my shitty, laminated photocopy of my drivers license.
There’s the occasional eucalyptus tree lining the road. I didn’t know that they had those here. It makes me homesick.
But hey, at least I haven't shat my pants yet.
The sky is a gorgeous blue with fluffy white cumulus floating about, taking up about half the sky. Again, perfect riding conditions. Cameroon is just green, green, green and more green. It's so monotonous that when you pass a rare, red, flowering tree in bright full bloom it really hooks your eyes and leaves an impression.
It tickles me when people are a couple of hundred metres up the road from me and they turn to look at where all the noise is coming from.
The Shrike at 80 clicks heading uphill makes a hell of a racket!
Fuckin *righteous!*
I’ve noticed that I fantasise a lot less about my desk job back home. It seems to get further and further away all the time...
I work and I work and I hoard up all that money; and for what?
To what *end?*
I reckon that the next time around I’ll work just as much as I need to make the ends meet, and then get to the ends themselves. The "Why".
Do things.
Learn shit.
I've been having daydreams about surfing in the morning, in to work at ten, out at two, then heading to a class for language or music or going for a run or learning how to be a pilot or something like that. Different shit. A modern day fucking renaissance man.
I've also had fantasies about not working at a desk job anymore, and being a labourer instead. The dream is to lift things. That’s all. Do an honest day’s work.
I think the way I want to structure my life when I get back home is of physical and mental exhaustion, *every day*. Have the eyes roll into the back of my head even before it hits the pillow.
That's what brings happiness and contentment, I reckon.
An honest day's work and an honest day's learning.
I think that before the trip I had the physical side down-pat. Logging big miles into my running shoes every day was making me sleep like a baby at night. But I neglected the mental side almost completely; in the four years I worked at the desk I don't think that I learned hardly any new practical skills or absorbed any real practical knowledge about *anything*.
I ceased to be a student.
I settled in to knowing what I needed to know in order to do my job, and no more.
Not through lack of opportunity, but rather through a lack of gumption. Lack of curiosity. I didn’t give a shit for it. I tried - half-arsed - with music. I put too much faith in osmosis - the idea that if I put myself in the right environment, that I'll just "pick it up"; if I soak myself in something that it will sink in eventually.
I've tried it with music, I've tried it with language.
Osmosis doesn't do *shit*.
Well, at least *I* don't work like that. *At all.*
We all need teachers; they give us direction and structure.
When I return home, I want to have many different teachers for many different skills. As many as I can get my hands on.
I want to be a jack of every trade.
Learning awaits. It's exciting. I know I have the aptitude for anything I set myself to.
My problem is discipline...
"90% of success is showing up." Don't remember who said that, but it's true.
*I need to keep showing up.*

## Chapter Fourty Three
*Yaounde.*
And I didn’t shit my pants. *Not once.*
I waste no time and head straight to the Republic of Congo Consulate on the bike. "Visa hours" are over for the day, but they let me in to ask questions.
All seems normal; they want an invitation letter or a hotel booking - which I've forged already. But the annoying bit is that they say it will take one week to issue. One *week*... And it's only a fifteen day visa.
For seventy-ish bucks.
That’s a bloody long time to wait for a very short, very expensive visa...
I *can* get an "express" visa. That'll cost double, and take three days to issue...
Express??!! *Express my arse!*
I hate this shit.
I'm tempted to roll the dice and hope I can pick it up in Gabon for cheaper...
In any case, they can't kick things off today as they're closing up shop, so I jump on the bike and take off.
On the way out I ride past a bloke wearing a suit, which is odd; he’s casually taking a piss into the gutter on the side of the road...
*As you do...*
---
I shack up at a place run by some church organisation at the top of a hill overlooking Yaounde in another bowl of mountains.
It’s a tranquil, secluded spot with a big paddock of turf out the back with a big tree and a swing plonked in the middle. I can already see myself in the picture reading a book.
My bed looks like it came out of the hospital barracks of a bad world war one movie. The fact it's a dorm doesn't help the image...
But, that said, the rest of the place has a homey, cottagey feel to it. Which is a really nice break from the monotony of cheap hotels.
It's a big two storied house that's got an aged feeling to it that isn't unpleasant. It smells old. Like old wood. The place is run by an old man from Switzerland named Jana. He's got a massive wound on his head. Looks pretty friggin gnarly. I don't ask him about it. There are two old women here, two young blokes and one little girl.
I’m the only visitor. Just me.
Despite this, I'm a bit worried about not being able to lock up my shit anywhere, and The Shrike is just floating around out the front, but I'm here now and there's nothing for it.
Three days of lazing about, coming right up; I'll work hard to shorten that by pouring on the charm at the Congo embassy, but I think it will fall on deaf ears.
---
I head into town to connect with the rest of the planet.
Back home, and Mum's freaking out. Like, freaking *right* the fuck out.
I reckon she’s had a proper meltdown. Beside herself. Hysterical.
Lunatic.
*Poor Dad.*
In the last message she’s saying that she can't handle it and I need to leave Africa. Lots of ALL CAPS and exclamations and demands. And that’s unfair; I’m pretty safe here in Cameroon. Fair enough to be a bit shirty about Nigeria - that’s only natural - but that’s all in the mirrors now.
Usually I ignore these messages, but this one seemed to snap something in me; and I tee off.
It's harsh and blunt, basically saying "build a bridge", because I'm not dropping everything and coming home. I’m here. I'm not leaving. *Get over it.*
I'm a grown man, for fuck's sake. At what age do you stop listening to your parents?? *This* many years old.
I hit send. An instant later I realise how much of a piece of shit I am. I send an immediate apology.
The whole thing goes down like a lead balloon.

## Chapter Fourty Four
Today, I start the day with a smile.
I’m up early and away to the Congo Embassy.
The embassy is one of those places where the people look like they've never smiled in their lives; a sad, passive-aggressive bunch. What is it about people in diplomatic posts with no jam in their doughnuts?
The security guard at the gate has cogged me from yesterday afternoon, and kicks things off on the wrong foot by asking me for my motorcycle papers.
"Why?"
He doesn't give a good reason.
Something like: "Because."
I hate it when people ask for stuff that is none of their business; here's looking at you, Mr Nigeria-Border-Wanker.
I cough up the papers, which are in English, and the douche looks thoughtfully at the page that's dedicated to vehicle registration transfer applications...
*Tit.*
I get past him into the embassy proper, and write up my application form on a comfy leather couch in front of a couple of desks of the worker bees.
They want copies of everything.
And I mean *everything*. They even want photocopies of the blank pages of my passport... and the irrelevant sheets of my motorbike rego.
*Whatever Trevor.*
I give them a copy of my passport's "photo page" for a start. It's only half a sheet of paper - torn in half - so I could fit more than one copy on the page.
Not good enough... One of the worker bees doesn’t like the tear in the paper.
*Nit pickers.*
I cheekily reach for the scissors to even up the cut. He doesn't like that.
Not. One. Bit...
He starts getting *really* demanding; it’s obvious from the look on his face that he’s trying his best to be as difficult as he possibly can. I can tell he's looking for a fight; dying for a fight.
All he gets in reply are big smiles and a lot of thumbs up and “pas de problem”; I don't want to give him a shred of satisfaction.
I head off to find a photocopier shop...
---
I've got *tonnes* of paper. Enough to choke on. A thick fuckin stack of it.
I head back and place the pile on the desk. Big smiles. Are we happy now, arsehole?
*Nope.*
I think he’s cogged that me coming across all sycophantic is a bit of a joke on him.
I don’t think he likes me much... He decides that he can’t give me a LP for the bike.
Piece of *shit*.
Whatever. Who cares? This is my Tuesday.
They *can* issue the visa which is good news, even though it's the worst value visa in Africa. But I can't pay here, I have to head to a bank that’s halfway across town, make a cash deposit, and then bring back a stamped money slip.
This just keeps *dragging*...
But what other choice do I have?
---
I walk. I get to see Yaounde. And to think...
Yaounde ain’t ugly. The city sits in a sort of crater made by the mountains. The hills are green and the occasional low hanging cumulus cloud floats under the peaks, into our bowl.
I think of this trip, and how I feel about it at the moment. I reckon I'm treating it trip in just the same way as I treat a marathon.
It feels just like that.
For the first half I'm "in the moment", I'm carrying out the planned pace and getting done what I've got to get done.
Workman-like.
But, as always happens in a race, right at the halfway point - which is essentially now - I want to accelerate. I start to want to just have it over and done with. I fall into the trap of thinking that there's “not long to go”, and I think more and more of the finish line.
I've done something like seven thousand clicks since Dakar and I've still got roughly the same distance again to go - and that's if I *“go to Cape Town, go directly to Cape Town, do not pass go, do not collect $200”*. It's still a massive distance to cover. Uncountable hours in the saddle.
I can't think that I'll be able to get this done *"just like that"*. Angola and Namibia are *huge* countries. I keep on thinking that it's right there, *so close*, and in my mind I calculate how many day's it will take to get there if I "nail it".
In the marathon - with this mindset - I burn out; I’ve done that twice before. I "take off" at the half way point, full of enthusiasm. "This is a piece of cake, time to *really* run." In ten clicks I fry myself out completely - a physical and mental quaking mess with only three quarters behind me. The final ten is *hell*.
I need to learn from it. Stop making the same mistakes. Slow things down.
Lots of my thoughts these days are revolving around things that I have little or no control over. It's silly and achieves nothing. Like Angola, and just how the hell I’m going to get a ticket into the place. I've two chances to get the visa, the first is Libreville in Gabon and the second is Brazzaville in Congo. I don't want to go to Brazzaville – I’ve heard it’s a nightmare – so that puts a lot of pressure on Libreville. If they simply say *no* in Libreville – and it can be as easy as that - "no" - then I’ll be forced to go to Brazzaville. And if they say "no" in Brazzaville then my options become really, *really* poor. Option One is to backtrack to get the visa... to *Togo*. I already know that I'm not going to do that; go back through Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria and Benin?
*Fuck that.*
Option Two is to go from Brazzaville to Zambia via the "other Congo", *the bad Congo*, The *Democratic Republic* of Congo. The old *"Zaire"* And that means taking "the death road", or is it "the hell road"? It's not good, whatever it is... A few thousand kilometres in outback *DRC* on a road with a horrendous reputation for being almost impassable most of the time.
I think I would do it... but to do it solo?
No.
It’d kill me. But, at the same time, I don’t see people queuing up to do it with me. I could maybe wait for *JB the Brit* to catch up...
Option Three is to ship my way out of trouble. I don't think I could do that.
I know that doing Africa, top to bottom, is arbitrary and meaningless - but what an arbitrary and meaningless achievement! I wouldn't ship.
So, what I've got are three options, none of which is *really* an option.
What that means is that I've got to make the Angolan visa stick in Gabon.
Come hell or high water.
But, again, that's something that I have very limited control over.
So, I think what I'm getting at here, is that I need to be armed to the teeth for any possibilities at the Angolan Embassy in Libreville. And that means going armed with a residency permit, a letter of invitation, a hotel booking, two references, the whole nine yards. There really is too much at stake to be happy-go-lucky for that one; I'm fucked if it doesn't work out. I think, if it did come to an Angola fail at the embassy, I would try to get a visa extension for Gabon and kill time there while I wait for JB to catch up, and we’d do the death road together... 
Maybe...
---
I toss the bank statement in the face of the unhappy arsehole.
Another thing I've been getting shitty about for nothing is the Congo visa. No use working yourself up over it. It is what it is; be happy to wait in a peaceful place for it. What's the rush?
---
Rain day.
Tasks for today include snoozing like I’m getting paid for it, eating, and reading.
Tough gig.
Task one goes till something like 9am, eventually waking up to the sounds of rain on the tin roof and bird birds going berserk through the open window.
As good a way to wake up as I can think of. Well, alone, that is, of course...
Well, that's depressing...
Bean and egg sandwich from just down the road, and that’s task two done.
I’m on fire today.
I grab a "3 in 1" Nescafe coffee sachet. I don't know what the three are...
I spend all of what’s left of the day reading *Les Miserables.*
All that time reading - almost non-stop - and I only get make five percent progress, according to the e-reader.
This book is a beast.
If you haven't read it yet, you should.
If you've never been in love before you could skip to where Marius meets Cosette and then you'll know what it's like. If you think you've been in love you should probably read this part anyway just to check that you're doing it right...
For lunch I had maybe the tastiest sauce I've had in ages. Delicious greasy green cassava sauce served with something that was like a fufu but much tastier, served in a shape resembling... Hmmm I don't know what. A fat cylinder. Hold your snickering... Be mature. Anyway, a really, really good and simple lunch.
Dinner is an omelette in bread from a man with a rolling kitchen.
And that’s another day in the books.
Tick.
---
I'm still thinking of the finish line.
*I can’t help it.*
I'm doing the math incessantly; distances, ride times, breaks for getting visas, border days.
Trying to plan the un-plannable.
I'm even thinking about whether I can go via the eastern countries; it'd be a detour, but what a great detour! Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique... Fuck yes.
It's fruitless, really, to be thinking of this any sooner than the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is where I’ll find that fork in the road.
And that's still a long, long way off.
It's a crapshoot; the only thing that you can be *really* sure of is that what you’ve planned definitely won’t be what happens.
I've got to keep reminding myself that there will come a time, one day, when I'll wish I could come back to this time of freedom and discovery. The fact that all I want is to rush it and have it over and done doesn't give any respect to that...
Live in the moment.
It's just like a day's ride on The Shrike; when my head is buried in the GPS, always wondering how long to go, it seems to take forever. But when I enjoy the ride and soak up the surrounds - and don't look at the GPS - the time flies and it's *far* more enjoyable.
*A watched kettle never boils."
---
The next morning is another wipe.
I've got nothing better to do, so I head to the Congo Embassy to see how things are going.
The moment I arrive the worker bees jump all over me.
They’ve been trying to call me for *days*. There’s a problem with my application.
*Shit*.
I really should get a phone number. It’s times like this that faking a local number on forms bites me in the arse.
The problem with my application, I’m told, is that my hotel confirmation letter (which I forged...) has a duration (a month) that is longer than the period of the visa (only 15 days).
It's just as well that they've pulled me up on it; I had the vague feeling when I walked out of the embassy a few days back that I'd (and this is unrelated...) fucked up my visa's starting date on the form; a niggling feeling that I’d put a "six" on the month of entry instead of a "five". June, instead of May; which, indeed, I did.
This would have meant that - had my application been successful - my visa would have started a month after I wanted it to, which would have been long after my Gabon visa expires. There would have been a two week black hole with no valid visa for either country...
Thank fuck I stuffed up the hotel stay.
“Je venir tres vite!” which is french for “I come very fast!” Doesn’t translate well, granted, but that's how you say "I'll be right back."
I run to the closest "cyber" to re-forge a new email with the dates tidied up to match the visa I want.
It's weird, because, for authenticity, the second fake email confirmation has be a reply to me asking for them to change my dates because I've made a mistake... “Oh, really sorry, I’ve mixed up my dates, can you change them for me?” and then a reply from them back, waxing lyrical with fancy words but essentially saying nothing more than “yeah sure, no worries”.
It’s a paper trail of forged garbage, complete with correct timestamp data and signatures.
It’s got to look legit.
It’s more lying than I feel comfortable with...
The whole job takes twenty minutes.
I quickstep back to the embassy and hand them the “new” emails.
No one at the embassy even bats an eyelid.
I thought I was being pretty blatant - and was gonna get called out for it - but they either don’t know, or they do know and they don’t care. I can't tell which.
They would be within their rights to cancel the application and ask me to re-apply - and pay again - or they could say that it's going to be another three day wait.
Instead, I had my passport back in my hot hands - with a visa - within fifteen minutes.
You ripper. Gotta be happy with that result.
Next stop, *Gabon*. Right on the Equator. Tropical, no doubt...
*There will be mud...*

## Chapter Fourty Five
Ebolowa.
The ride was a bit of a blur. A blur of green. So much bloody green. Good tarmac. It all just rolled easily by.
It's amazing how quickly my brain can assimilate and normalise natural beauty. I'm completely desensitized to it already.
Surrounded by the stunning - and yet not paying attention to any of it.
Just a few days ago this would have had me gawking out of my helmet, now it's just "par for the course".
Doesn’t matter how good things get, us humans have a knack for making the amazing the new benchmark, and then we go looking for something better... Never happy.
I was spat on by the odd bit of rain. I was expecting to get soaked. Very lucky, though I'm not sure how long that's going to last.
There's nothing wrong with Ebolowa. Nice enough middling village with enough action to keep me happy.
I ask around at the more obvious expensive hotels for where the budget options are, and they point me in the right direction.
At the budget hotel, the boss shows me around my potential room.
The toilet has a big nugget of shit hanging on to the side of the toilet bowl. And when I say a big nug, I mean *big*. It's breaking the laws of physics, a real cliff hanger.
It’s that kind of place...
I get a *different* room. Despite the nug, the boss wants eight grand for the night. He haggles like a fiend... I manage to punch him down to five thousand, but it's like I'm pulling teeth.
It’s actually pretty decent accommodation.
Clean.
Having my own bathroom is something of a luxury.
After skipping lunch today (again...) I'm deadset *Lee Marvin*, so I head out to grab grub. Ebolowa is Goldilocks; big enough for hotels, small enough for everything to be packed into one epicentre.
I quickly find some green ‘n’ greasy cassava sauce that came with big fat curls of mystery animal skin. Imagine the curls of pork crackling, but instead of being fried or baked or whatever it’s been boiled. So it’s *not* nice and crunchy, but soft and chewy.
*Super* chewy.
It's not pleasant texturally - at all - but still tastes pretty good, like chewing the fat on a steak. That said, I’m very, *very* conscious of the fact that I’m eating an animal right now... Where the hair’s been ripped out of the skin it's all prickly, like the animal had goosebumps when they lopped its head off and it stayed that way.
Mmmm. *Yum.*
I sit at the bar where they were serving up the grub for a couple of hours and just watch the world go by. Just looking dead into space. Car and people rolling by.
Might have been the effect of not eating then filling the stomach. I don't want to move a muscle...
With the sun setting I chase down an omelette cart man - with his hot-dog stand style setup.
Dessert is a bunch of bananas and a few oranges that have been peeled for me - which is a wildly popular thing here in Africa.
I really, really, *really* want to like Cameroon.
I've been looking hard for things to blow me away and compel me to put it at the top of my "favourite places" list. But if I'm honest, it's just not there.
For a great country you don't have to *look* for the amazing, it will find you. And sure, Cameroon has been excellent, travelling has been easy, the landscapes have been nothing but green, the weather has - surprisingly - turned it on, the people are super friendly - it's got everything in spades - but it's missing some sort of "X factor". It just doesn't have *it*.
---
The border day starts out chilly and foggy.
I’m cold in my jacket again on the ride to the post.
I say my goodbyes to the decent tarmac and steel myself for a heavy day in the saddle.
The cloud eventually clears to leave beautiful blue skies and fluffy cumulus with the sun smashing down on my head to get things baking.
I make the border and check out of Cameroon with no dramas. After the Douane checks my passport (not sure why he’d do that) the guy say’s that he’s thirsty, which means I should give him a little something for a drink.
I don’t even blink. I go to the saddlebags and grab him a plastic sack of water. Cost me 5 cents.
I’m a genius. Hilarious.
I’m promising myself that I can laugh at this later. For now it’s straight faces.
He’s not happy with it.
"What? You said you were thirsty?"
"No not this, I want a beer."
"That's too bad..."
He's already nibbled on a corner of the water bag, now he tries to give it back to me... "Nah mate, it’s yours now."
I roll on to the Police post. 
In the shack I introduce myself around. One of the assistants, a huge fat lad, jumps all over me.
His name is Raoul, and he wants so badly to be an American.
This bloke’s watched *way* too many movies. The thickness of the Yankee accent he’s putting on is outrageous. Totally over the top.
He's in his element, and he’s hamming it up for me as best he can for his mates.
Despite the ridiculous accent his English is solid, and it’s a nice change to find myself on the other side of the fence - where I’m privy to a conversation and everyone else is in the dark. Like we're speaking a private language.
A girl walks into the post to get her passport stamped, and Raoul loses it.
She cops a roasting.
"Oh my god those eyes - *unbelievable*. And check out that huge *ass*! *Incredible*!"
All while she’s right there and oblivious. And, yes indeed, she’s a looker... I’m sitting in the corner grinning my head off.
The cops are still getting my details down when another bloke walks into the post. It’s pretty obvious, even to me, that he’s without papers, and he’s having a crack at bribing his way across the border. I see 10,000 CFA getting thrown around. A bit more than twenty bucks.
But the cops aren’t going for it.
The bloke gets a hard no and he goes wild. Cracks shits, bigtime.
*This is gonna come to blows...* He’s yelling at the cops, *right in their faces.*
They frogmarch him out of the tent.
As he storms off, Raoul is in his element, taunting this poor bloke no end in French. The cops are loving it. Pissing themselves laughing. And I’m laughing too, even though I don't cog a word of it.
So long, Cameroon, it’s been a blast.
---
Gabon!
We cross a gorgeous little (bridged) river and arrive at the post. The blokes there inspect my passport, write my details down on a piece of paper and tell me to go “vant-nerf kilomet”, that’s 29 kilometres, up the road to get my passport stamped.
Odd. Never had to do that before.
I go a few clicks up the road and there’s a Douane checkpoint.
Nope, no dice there either.
Why the fuck bother with a checkpoint then? Why have any border control at all?
They tell me to get a laissez-passer in *Bitam*, which turned out to be the 29km up the road.
Off I go.
And straightaway I’m shocked. Wonderfully shocked; the roads are good.
*Real* good.
So much for a mud pit...
---
In Bitam I take on the Douanes, first.
There's no need to be worried, because it's not a roped setup, which means that they can't keep me hemmed in if I get refused.
And yet...
The heart won't pay attention to rational thought; I can feel it beating heavily in my chest.
I go through the bottom few layers of plebs and end up having to sit about for longer than I’d like to in a waiting room.
Just stewing.
Eventually the chief will see me. Her name is Elizabeth.
Go Gabon.
I apologise for my French, in French, as always.
It's a ploy. It always gets a smile and a small chuckle - so I'm sure it must sound like shit - but for some reason it makes everyone try to help me out. Like I’m some sort of endearing, well-meaning moron in need of some assistance.
"Pardon pour m'Francais, cest pa bon, je'dua appran plu Fraincais". Doesn’t crack it with Liz... she flies on in machine gun, rapid-fire-French.
Whatever.
She wants to see my Carnet.
That old chestnut...
I roll out my usual spiel. It's well practised by now... Showing off all the places I've been and all that.
She tells me that it's impossible to issue a "passavant", which I think is an LP... that starts at one end of the country and ends at the other.
I pull out my Cameroon LP "Voila... Pa de problem".
Most of the time I'm actually quiet, letting them convince themselves.
Give someone enough rope...
After a long grind it eventually works; she wants to help me out.
She issues me a "passavant", even though I reckon they’re breaking some of their own rules to do it.
I've no idea about the technicalities of a passavant, but so long as it has a stamp on it I can wave it in the face of anyone who tries to stop me; and that's enough.
Apparently it's going to take them a while, so I head to Immigration.
It's a shack that looks like it should be selling food...
They want two photocopies of my passport, which is normally not required. I reckon Immigration’s in cahoots with the photocopying mob across the road. Seems a nice little cottage industry they’ve got going, and it doesn’t help that photocopies are four times the normal price.
I’ve only got just under three blank pages left in the passport; two clean blank pages and one page with the Mauritania and Ghana stamps on it. The rest are all packed with stickers and ink.
The blank pages are really starting to come in at a premium; I don't want to run out of space and have to order a new passport just to get through these next few countries.
The bloke at Immigration wants some money to stamp it where I wanted him to; right in amongst a sea of other ink all crowded in on top of each other. I pretend I don’t understand French very well. He gives in and stamps it - correctly - and tosses it back to me.
*I'm in.*
I head back to the Douanes and there's a gorgeous passavant there for me. Lovely. They don't ask for any money either. Fucking bonus.
Job done. Before I peel out of Bitam I stop at a restaurant with people eating what looks like some pretty basic food. I ask the boss "combi-yan de la mem shose" - *how much for the same thing*, pointing to one of the other guys who's eating what looks like rice and cassava. 1500cfa. Wowsers. A dish like that usually maxes out at 500cfa, and that's for a shedload, that’s like all you can eat. I make exclamations but she's sticking to her guns. No wriggle room.
Bugger that.
I go next door and have a chocopan with bread, which is Africa’s answer to Nutella, for 400cfa, which, again, is pretty outrageous.
I’m starting to smell a trend...
Anyway. We’re out of here.
---
Superb.
Fucking superb.
It's twice as good because I was expecting no road at all.
Perfect tarmac with constant corners and ups and downs like a beautiful gentle roller-coaster.
It's so nice to have rock bottom expectations and have them be thoroughly, delightfully, exceeded.
This place is possibly even greener than Cameroon.
The trees are hugging a bit closer to the side of the road and the subtle effect is noticeable. The trees shadows over the road, sometimes canopying over the route.
Wonderful. Fucking gorgeous.
We hit a joint called Oyem at about three in the afternoon. It's a confused village, with no real heart, no epicentre.
The first hotel I stop in at looks pretty standard to me, but they want 10,000 CFA. Twenty bucks.
When I explain to them that I’m more in the region of four grand, they take me to a room that's a pile of shit. Just a dirty, dirty bed.
8000 CFA.
Ah, no. No thanks.
I ride all over town, stopping at six other places I find. They're either shithouse and cheap or they're shithouse and expensive. All are “in the middle of nowhere” locations.
I'm getting tired and headachy from ripping off and squeezing on my helmet fourteen times. My ears are about to get completely ripped off...
I go back to my first option and take a 10,000cfa room for eight grand. I can certainly live with that, but it's very poor value.
I get settled and go grab some water. 100cfa for a sachet; double Cameroon and quadruple the rest of Africa.
I'm still not sure if I’m being had, or if Gabon is just plain expensive, but yeah, the correlation is getting stronger with every purchase.
Dinner’s a simple bowl of rice with mystery meats for 1000cfa, two bucks, *double* what it should be.
Gabon's gonna cost me!
---
There's a shower.
A *hot* shower.
Hot tip: If you really, really want to enjoy something, like, “the divine vision” sort of level of enjoyment, just abstain from whatever it is for as long as you can.
And then have it...
Despite the very dark, very dingy bathroom, this is still something special.
It's been forever.
It's like nirvana...
Sweet baby Cheeses!
In your life, you’ve never had a shower like this...
Well, sure you have; you probably have one every day. Maybe two. Maybe three if you’re OCD. But a shower like *this*. No. Never. Not in your life.
I can feel every drop.
A hot shower is an absolute riot of the senses. A total overload. There’s nothing that’s even remotely like it.
We’re all just desensitised to it.
The opulent and wonderful has become the mundane and routine.
This shower might be the single greatest physical feeling I’ve ever had. *Ever*.
I slid off this planet somewhere into the realm of the purely physical. Pure experience. Pure feeling.
I’m only vaguely aware that far off back in the real world I’m making involuntary noises.
After what has probably been much too long an amount of time - or maybe it was only seconds? - I snap back into myself like a click of the fingers, come back to my brain, and realise where I am. It's a shower, again.
---
Today's gonna be a gorilla.
Almost four hundred clicks worth of riding, and then into a busy capital: *Libreville.*
I’m already kicking myself for having slept through till eight in the morning. I reckon that’s gonna be a mistake...
By my numbers it’s going to be something like seven hours of non-stop riding. Ideally I’d break that sort of distance down into two days, but as far as I can tell on the maps there’s nothing going on between here and Libreville.
Even though I’m already behind the eight ball, there’s nothing that can stop me from having another shower.
---
The Shrike gets a brimful of juice at the local "Oil Libya" (yeah, that’s totally a thing...) and we’re off.
Only a small way out of the village and I come across a street sign that stops me in my tracks. Libreville: 525km
*Whatthefuck??*
That’s not right...
My planned route was going to take me on the “A5”, but this sign, I guess, is telling me to go a different way...
The A5, on the maps, looks like it skims the border with a neighbouring country – a country that I’m skipping myself – called "Equatorial Guinea" which is a small country, and, apparently, notoriously unwelcoming to foreigners. I’ve no qualms in skipping it. Anywho, the A5 - depending on which map you believe - either comes super-duper close to the border, or very briefly, crosses the border - dipping into Equatorial Guinea - and then crosses right back. Which would be totally pointless and stupid. But there you go.
I ride on. What else am I going to do?
---
At the turnoff for the A5 there’s another street sign with "Frontier Guinea Eq." written on it. The arrow points off the tarmac and onto a red dirt track that’s gone a deep red-brown with the rain, disappearing off into the thick jungle of trees...
Nope.
Nup.
No.
Too many things can go wrong.
What happens if I get a hundred odd clicks up the road, after hours in the saddle, in the middle of nowhere, only to find a border control post douchebag who gives me a flat "Nope, sorry…"?
What then?
There’s also a chance that Mother Nature might say "No. I’ve fucked the road for you with rain, sorry".
Even if that was ok, after a late start I don't reckon I can handle 300km of who-knows-what condition dirt track.
Really, there’s no option at all.
Tarmac all the way.
I take off down the blacktop, feeling a little gutless.
I miss having JB the Brit around.
If he were here, it would have been a no-brainer as well... "Yes! Dirt!! About fucking time, I’m sick of this boring blacktop!"
I would have gone along with it.
Interesting, how one person can change everything. Solo it’s inconceivable, tandem it’s inconceivable *not* to. It would have been one hell of a day to go that way.
As a solo biker it’s screaming out “death by misadventure”. If anything goes balls up you're alone in the middle of nowhere. What if I come off and snap my leg. What then? I'd be in a deep load of fucked. That’s what.
I’m not too crushed about the detour. So it goes... It make’s everything go from feeling mostly unknown to probably ok; but the trouble is that it's taken a monster of a day and turned it into a PB ride. I have to break some of my iron-butt records...
Too bad. Suck it up. Get it done.
---
Six hours in, and what can I say?
This is, maybe, as good as it gets. And if it ain’t, then it’s surely fucking close.
From shower nirvana to biking paradise.
Six hour’s worth of stunning nature and perfect, perfect road. A better ride I couldn’t design: The tarmac rides fast, with curves smooth and long enough that you can do it any speed, any gear you wish, but it keeps a tightness that gets you laying the bike right over every single corner.
It feels like a river, ribboning and snaking back onto itself over and over and over and over.
Unlike a river, the road rises and falls as well.
It never rests, never stops.
It’s a never ending dance in three dimensions in a sea of green.
Hundreds of kilometres of ever-changing racetrack.
And it's all mine.
The only hint of traffic is the occasional truck that's rolled over into the jungle from taking a corner too quick. The trucks here are even equipped with welded on roll-cages...
The surrounds are beautiful, monotonously so. A constant deep, thick green of huge trees that come right up to the side of the road.
Thick! Packed with life.
This is as good as nature gets.
In many places the road makers have had to cut a swathe sheer into the mountainside to make the road possible. The massive, ancient trees sitting impossibly on the precipice at the top make me feel like a child again; the whole world towering all around me.
The beauty is so all encompassing, the monotony so complete, that I quickly desensitise again and stop paying attention.
Every now and again I snap out of a daydream to have my breath taken away by something suddenly revealed out of the living green walls; like, cresting the top of a hill with a moment's clear view of the immensity of the rain forest sprawled out beneath. It goes on forever. A carpet of green.
Green green green green green.
In six hours I’ve barely stopped riding at all.
I’m starting to feel a little giddy.
I haven't been taking care of myself, and I know it.
No lunch.
It’s proper hot and reeking humid, and I haven't been drinking enough water; only half a litre since this morning... Which, in these conditions - with a leather jacket, kevlar jeans and a black helmet, mind you - is clearly not enough.
I snap out of my giddiness when I see a sign:
VOUS FRANCHISSEZ L'EQUATEUR.
I’m not sure whether to celebrate... The word “franchissez” has thrown me a bit; I've no idea what it means.
"Cross", or "approach"?
The sign's giving nothing away - it's just a crappy road sign. None of the fanfare that should accompany something as big as the crossing of the equator...
I get off the bike to take a happy snap, just in case. I get swamped by those little black eye-loving wasps. The air is so thick with the annoying, persistent little fuckers that I can’t get a clear shot of the sign without one of them ending up as a black blur on the picture, or jumping into the corner of my eye and digging its way under.
They're driving me fucking nuts.
They’re obviously not out on the road, otherwise I’d have a few hundred thousand of the bastards sprayed over the front of my visor by now... No. They're smarter than that. They must lie in wait for a victim...
Trick to keeping them out of your eyes is to keep walking all the time. I lead on a cloud of them behind me like the pied piper.
I get my shots, and ride on.
No other signs. I guess that was it then...
I'm into the southern hemisphere, which happens to be my favourite hemisphere.
---
A short ride after the equator the road turns to shit.
It’s evident that they plan to re-lay it – with all the machinery and foundation laid down and ready to go.
The shitty road follows the banks of a massive river. It'd take a sprinter about twentyish seconds to run from one bank to the other, I reckon. That is, if the sprinter was Jesus...
So yeah, big river. What’s more impressive is how fast the water is moving for such a huge river. Moving faster than I jog. That thing must be shifting a shit tonne of water.
I worry about a puncture. The rocks on this to-be road are sharp...
That's the least of my troubles; at this rate I'm fuck all chance of making Libreville by dark...
---
The road transforms back into flawless, brand spanking new tarmac; they haven’t even had the time to put the white lines on it...
I think that was half an hour of rough stuff. Maybe?
I’m really starting to feel myself bugging out now.
My head isn't keeping pace with the bike.
Brain not working.
I don’t know what time it is, but it’s far enough past a skipped lunch to be in some trouble...
It's stupid, and I know it.
I'm wigging out, and I'm still passing villages with perfectly good places to take a break...
The drive to cover as much mileage as possible is near *manic*. Utterly single minded. And it's to my detriment; I won’t stop to take a quick break, I won’t stop to look at something, or turn around the bike to take a photo of a funny street sign, like a village called "Plus-Tard".
I will *not* smell the roses.
The only thing I stop for is to piss, and, given I'm not drinking anything, it's a rare occurrence.
But I'm not hungry, not thirsty, not hot, not tired, not anything.
---
It comes to a head; my arms and my head feel like they're full of lead. I feel on the edge of blacking out.
My desperation to get to Libreville is finally outweighed by being terrified about passing out on the move. From manic for Libreville to manic for water.
I finally pull in at a dingy looking street-side restaurant, and it's only once I've come to a complete stop that I realise just how humid it is.
*Off the scale.*
In the absence of the airflow created by The Shrike I’ve got sweat marks forming all across the front of my shirt in seconds.
I should have known. The only place that hasn't had any airflow has been sweating profusely; my arse. The wet jeans have been pulling at my arse hair - all day. It's been mild torture; pulling out each hair, one by one, slowly.
If the rest of my body has been sweating all this time as busily as my arse, then I must've lost a tonne of fluids...
Maybe I’ve got heatstroke? *Shit*.
I sink a litre of water and pour another litre over my head. Feels good.
Chow time. It's overdue.
I force down a bowl of rice with a boiled river fish that has the taste and texture of thick mud.
It's what I needed; I'm feeling better as I feel the food and water go to work.
After lunch, I resolve to stop at the very next hotel.
Fuck Libreville. I'll do that tomorrow.
---
Sure enough, there's a decent looking hotel on the way out of the village.
I ignore it.
I want to get just a little bit further up the road than this.
*Just a little bit*.
As I crack on, I’m wondering what happens now if - so late in the day, and so exhausted, - I have a simple failure; tyre, chain, cable, whatever. Anything. Anything that stops me and needs a fix.
What happens then?
I hate riding this late in the day with no idea about where I’m going to sleep at night. But I do it again and again and again. I do it because of this baseless drive to push on, go a little further.
If something goes wrong it's going to suck. Hard.
Why the fuck do I do this?
---
I'm an hour since the re-start.
The road has swung around to the north west, up to Libreville.
The jungle has been thinned out. No more beauty.
There's been no villages either... Nowhere I can stay, at least.
I'm getting deeper and deeper in the hole.
The sun setting in the west is blinding my eyes with its glare.
I'd hit a cow at full speed if there was one the road... I can see spitting distance in front of me before blinding white light.
We're somewhere between one hundred and two hundred clicks from the capital, and I can feel myself crapping out again.
I’ve got no idea what options I’ll have for accommodation between here and there, and to stop and ask is time consuming, and I’m quickly running out of sunshine.
There are two villages between here and Libreville big enough to *at least* have sign-posted distances, so I figure they’re my best bet.
Fingers crossed...
---
The first village has nothing...
*Despair.*
Nothing doing.
I have to keep going.
I pass through the equator, again, back to the northern hemisphere.
I’m too tuckered out to take a photo.
I keep riding. Absolutely fucked.
---
Eighty clicks later, and this is my last option...
I'm cooked.
And if this village's got nothing, well... then it's a shit situation of riding at night, knackered, into a capital city.
Why do I insist on painting myself into these corners?
It’s brain dead.
On the outskirts of village number two the road turns to shit.
It's like someone ‘mac’d this thing with nothing but a shovel.
After a whole day's riding and more than four hundred clicks covered, I pull into “Le Como de Flamboyant”, if you’ll believe that.
They’ve got a shoebox room with a toilet and bucket showers and an unenthusiastic host who’s wearing a dress that makes her look like Kermit the Frog, or a colour inverted strawberry.
15,000CFA. Just north of thirty bucks.
That's shit value for a shit room; four times what it should be.
There's another room available. The sheets haven't been changed since the last guest. 12,000CFA. Just north of twenty five bucks.
This is bullshit.
Although I'm exhausted I don't take it. I can't. It's just too outrageous.
I do take directions and go looking for the next place. It’s an "Auberge", which is French for hostel.
It takes some finding. Time I don't have...
Here, they have a room with a bed and a fan.
And a *massive* spider sprawled out on the dried mud wall.
As big as my *fucking hand*.
Mean looking thing.
Looks big and powerful enough to jump clean across the room onto my face.
I ask to look at the bathroom. Filthy communal bucket showers, and an outhouse long-drop to shit in.
"Comby-an?" - How much?
7,500 CFA.
You've got to be fucking *kidding* me. Twenty bucks for a filthy shithole, rooming with a fucking bird eater.
I haggle.
He won't budge a single franc...
I can't do it; waking up in the middle of the night with that spider on my pillow, eight eyes looking at mine... I can't...
I head back to the Flamboyant and take my medicine.
My eyes roll back before my head even hits the pillow...
---
Libreville.
Finally.
On the way into Libreville, The Shrike's horn just completely stopped working. In a capital city a horn is a critical piece of safety equipment. In traffic, I found myself instinctively press the horn button, and on getting nothing, I would end up in a dangerous situation. Things like nearly getting crushed when splitting in gridlock.
I had to use my voice box as a pseudo-horn.
It did the job, but left me hoarse.
The first place I get to has a poster of my hometown on the wall - advertising it as a *holiday destination*.
Bizarre.
I cop a fat pang of homesickness.
While I’m waiting about for someone to haggle with, I notice that there’s a weird red splotch on my hand; a perfect round disk of red the size of a coin, with no raised skin or itchiness or nothing.
Doesn't look like a mosquito bite. This is something new...
Wait. There’s another one...
Aaand another one.
Fuck, here’s another one. And another. *Shit*.
What’s been eating me?
I do a head count and get nine on my left arm and three on my right arm...
The chief’s here.
He wants an astronomical 11,500 CFA a night. Minimum.
Divide 11,500 by 450 in your head... What's that? I can't do it. More than 20, less than 30.
I end up punching him down to ten grand. That'll do. I don't have the fight in me to try anywhere else.
Twenty to thirty bucks gets me a big room with a big bed that isn’t 100% clean; she looks a bit splotchy and tired...
The water doesn't work, but I'm assured that it will be on for an hour each day when the city turns on the water pumps...
In the meantime: Bucket.
The power comes and goes.
It is what it is...
Not pleasant.
I take advantage of the already full bucket and wash off the morning rides sweat and grime. 
The chicken skin on my plucked arse has turned into stubble. Delightful.
To say it feels weird would be a gross understatement.
Moving right along...
---
Libreville is a sweatbox.
The dead, heavy, wet air and the brutal, merciless sunshine combine to make things constantly uncomfortable.
Every pore of skin - the whole body over - is pumping out sweat as fast as it can make it. And when I say the whole body over, I mean the *whole* body over.
Try that, shoehorned into a “share taxi” with seven other humans. That’s seven people in a normal car. Figure that out... After a while you get used to the idea that you don’t know whose sweat is whose and what smell is coming from where anymore.
Rankity rank rank.
Anywho.
I find the Angolan Embassy. And I’m flat out, unceremoniously rejected.
Residents only.
I ask what if I *was* a resident, and they say that it would take fifteen days to issue the visa, which is more than my current Gabon visa will let me stay in the country for...
And just like that, I’m in the shit.
And - just as predicted - I’m going to keep going.
I’m going to go to Congo.
Which is dumb; I know it.
I *know* that I'm painting myself into yet another corner I don’t want to be stuck in. But I'm doing it anyway.
So, *why* am I doing it?
Dunno. No easier idea...
On the way home from the embassy the heavy air has turned into angry thunderclouds which break in one of the most impressive electrical storms I think I’ve ever seen.
I love this shit, it’s got the campfire effect to it; compelling viewing.
I head out into the middle of the street to watch the show.
The lightning is stretching and arcing its way beautifully through the sky. Rather than being a mere fleeting moment it feels like it hangs in the air silently for full seconds before fading.
Stunning. And then the crack and boom and rumble.
It's right overhead.
I’m grinning like an idiot when a bolt strikes so close to where I’m standing it’s like a bomb going off in front of my face.
It’s so close that it’s almost like I hear it a fraction before I see it and then instantly feel it.
I almost fall backwards trying to get back, hands and arms covering my face, everything tingling.
I swear all of the best words.
I reckon that’s quite enough of that...
---
So, after the clusterfizzer that was the Angolan embassy I find myself with a fair bit more Gabon time up my sleeve to kill. Nine days, in fact, till my Congo visa kicks off.
What to do?
Sloth. Of course.
I kill time and more time in my crappy room. I put away about six litres of water every day. And that’s while barely moving.
I hardly piss at all.
I catch a cold. Anyone who tells you that you catch a cold from being cold is full of shit...
I call the family because, amazingly, there is internet here, and it doesn’t suck.
It’s *not* good to see them.
They’re all scared shitless. No one can understand why I would want to go to Congo.
No one seems to get the “why”, and, listening to them, I’m not sure that I know what it is either...
They're all *genuinely* scared.
Their fear and doubt is contagious, and it’s infecting me from half a world away.
It’s not what I need right now. At all.
After I hang up I sit and stare blankly through the computer screen. I don't know how much time passes. Just staring.
I try to hold myself aloof from it, but it’s beaten me: I don’t want to be here anymore; *I want to go home.*
I’m scared.
Skittish.
Damnit. I should be better than this by now. I should be better at keeping a lid on this. New countries shouldn’t hold the fear against me.
But they do.
*Still!*
I'm a veteran at this game, for Christ’s sakes.
Sure, if there was no fear at all the border crossings might get a bit blasé...
Fear - in small doses - introduces excitement and zest.
This is how it should be: Don't be crushed by it, have fun with it. Understand how you're feeling and deal with it head on. If nothing else, think on how insignificant your tiny life is. You are a speck and a blink in the immensity of space and time. My life - which is what everyone is worried about - will end. *I am going to die.* How can I, knowing this, be beaten by fear. Have fear - fear is useful - but be the one dominating it, not the converse. Bravery isn't the absence of fear but the mastery of it. Be brave, be strong.
If it was easy, everyone would do it...
---
On a sudden impulse I head off to the Angolan Embassy, again, to have a crack at getting a super short “transit visa”.
I figure it's worth a shot and "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take," or something like that.
The bloke standing out front of the embassy cracks the shits at me. Something I couldn’t really catch, but I’m guessing was something like “this is an Embassy!” as he points at my hobo pants, which I’ve got rolled up to my knees in a futile attempt to stay cool.
There’s obviously a level of decorum here that I’ve missed, and he’s not impressed.
I roll them down to the ankles and suddenly – even in my pink t-shirt that has gone maroon with sweat and grub, I’m presentable.
Yeah sure...
Anywho, heading inside, my mate from round one of trying to swindle a visa, Maurice, is plainly the opposite of thrilled to see my mug walk into the joint. Again. The conversation goes something like this:
How about a transit visa?
No.
Pretty please?
No.
And that's it...
I guess I was expecting that. No one can say I didn’t try...
---
I kill some more time and distract myself by strolling through the guts of the city of Libreville. It’s pretty modern. There are some baby towers and the local headquarters of a few big, well known, oil companies. But despite how built up it all is the place is oddly quiet, so quiet that I feel the need to whisper, so different from the area that I'm staying in, which is bonkers.
I decide that I like the place - quiet on the inside, crazy on the outside.
---
As I get back to my shithole I finally admit something to myself that I’ve spent the last few days keeping under wraps: I still don’t feel quite right.
It's a sort of difficulty to focus. I can’t focus on something either with my mind or with my eyes that I’d normally have no trouble with. It’s like being unpleasantly spaced out and a little dizzy.
It frightens me a bit because I'm not sure if it's really there or not; it's so vague, so in the background.
What's making me feel like this?
I've thought about it, and all I know is that I don't know.
I’ve no answers, just questions.
If I stop talking about it you'll know that it's come good, just like those red splotches on my arms that have now disappeared...
I’ve decided that I’m not going to spend another week in this room. So tomorrow I’m going to try doing some exploring in Gabon, see what I’ll find.
---
I can’t fucking sleep.
I’ve been lying in this bed with my eyes shut for hours and hours and hours, and when I open my eyes I’m wide awake, completely alert. Not even close...
I get up and read a book. Get bored of that. Try to sleep again.
Hours...
Nope.
Still no good - still not even *close*.
I waste some time on the computer trying to get sleepy. I call my sister who’s just woken up in her part of the world.
I look like shit.
And I’m not exactly sharp...
Mum’s there with her.
Things are a little weird; my reply to her latest frantic email was a little brutal...
Slowly things get going. She says that I’m a good writer, which is surprising.
I've been sending home some updates, but I never really thought anyone would read them.
I've always thought that the only person who enjoys reading shit like that is the person who writes it.
For everyone else it's as boring as batshit for the same reason that going through someone else’s holiday photos is like pulling teeth; you weren't *there*.
A perfect example is Tony the Belgian. Way back in Morocco he made us watch endless hours of video and photos from *his* trips.
He was having a great time. Everyone else is wondering when he's going to have had enough and we can watch a movie or something.
There's nothing worse than someone coming back from a holiday showing you every... single... photo...
*Kill me.*
I figured that the crap I'd sent home would be a yawn fest for all concerned, and that they’d have to read it out of obligation - rather than out of interest.
But, weirdly, it would seem that some people are legitimately enjoying them.
I resolve to put the next big message home in a format that they can read while their sitting on the throne, which, let’s be honest, is probably the time of the day when we digest most of our reading.
Speaking of yawn fests, I’m finally bugging out. At last.
Sleep.
---
Up in the morning like a friggin corpse.
I don’t want to leave today. I’m not up for it. 
So I don’t.
Even though I know it’s not good for me, I don’t.
I kill a whole day glued to this screen, this fucking rectangle.
Doing useless shit.
I feel like a grub.
Is it weird that by illegally downloading some Portuguese lessons off the internet that I feel a real sense of satisfaction, like I’ve actually achieved something?
Pathetic.
The bar is set so low that I feel satisfaction for starting something that I’ll have to *actually* do in the future.
Bizarre.
Killing more time, I retroactively scare the shit out of myself by looking up some official travel advice from the British Government that covers some of the countries that I’ve been to so far.
*What an eye opener...*
The government supplies what I’m calling a "heat map", which is a “traffic lighted” map of each country.
Areas can be green – which is, of course, "no worries", yellow – which is "avoid all but essential travel", and red – which is essentially saying "don’t even think about it".
First, I check Nigeria; it’s red in the north and yellow in the south, kind of like I expected.
Then, Mauritania; I nearly fall off my chair.
Red. Lots of red. Mostly red, in fact. Places I’d been. Places I’ve spent *weeks* in.
*Holy Fuck!*
I had no fucking idea.
*Oblivious.*
The whole of that train trip, and *all* of that Sahara stuff was *red*.
I freak out for *past me*. Which is weird to say the least.
We *hitchhiked* in that!
Bloody good thing I didn’t know about this, or I never would have gone there in the first place.
No chance.
I might have not done Africa at all if I had seen any of *this* while in Spain.
Thank god for happy ignorance. Bliss, apparently.
And I wouldn't have done any of that if not for travelling in a group...
There's definitely a feeling of invincibility in a group. No matter what happens, you’re in it together and you’ll get each other out of the shit if need be. Someone’s got your back. The comfort zone moves way, way out – you can be as brave or as stupid as you want to be.
No fear.
The polar opposite is being alone. You have to take care of yourself. No one else will...
I’ve been taking the easiest, least-risky road because I don’t know if I can deal with something going wrong.
I feel like it’s an opportunity gone begging.
But. The self-discovery, if you can call it that, is magnified in the solitude. I don’t know what it is that I’m learning about myself, but I’m sure it’s something.
Plus, the sense of achievement is magnified. Mundane things in a group, like crossing Nigeria, now become a badge of honour when done solo. I didn’t need anyone’s help; I did it myself.
I reckon I would have felt like I’d cheated had I done it any other way...
But after months of solitude I’m missing companionship.
If a guy rides a motorbike solo through Africa and no one's there to see it, did it ever really happen?
---
After promising myself I’d leave Libreville today and go explore Gabon, I wake up to thunderstorms. I’m stoked: the decision has been taken out of my hands.
I go back to sleep.
The thunderstorms clear. The ball is back in my court again...
I’m going to wimp out.
I take the cop out and decide to kill another day. "Future Me" is furious; Gabon could be something incredible, and I’m wasting a free hit by wallowing in this dump. "Present Me" doesn’t give a single shit.
Show me infinite time and I’ll show you zero motivation.
Another day in the heat.
Another day in my head.
---
Something that I've come to realise, though I'm not 100% certain about it, is that I don't think that I actually miss home.
Well, I do. Of course I do.
I do.
Mum - don’t kill me - I do...
*But...*
As much as I miss home I think I miss *stability* even more.
I reckon, right now, I’d be just as happy to go to London - where I know people - as I would be to go home.
For a little while at least I would like there to be a few less "question marks" in my future.
Well, maybe not less question marks, but less severe ones than the ones that Africa poses. I reckon that's why I've been slothing in Libreville. For three days now there's been absolutely no "what-ifs?" From the security of this hotel room there's nothing that can happen to me - good or bad. And that's been nice. Here, I'm the boy in the bubble, interacting with the world through a safe rectangle.
Nothing can hurt me.
A week ago I thought that all I wanted to be was home again, but after three days of reflection it seems that that's not what I want at all. Being home would thrill me momentarily, but after the initial excitement it would depress me. Honestly, if I was dropped, right now, into home, I would be a complete loose end. I'd have no idea what I’m going to do next...
What I want is for things to be easy for just a little while.
No. No that’s not it.
My hands shake and my throat chokes up as I start to write what it *really* is. And I can’t... I can't write it. But then, I have to.
*I want out of Africa*
Is that it then? Is that what's eating me?
Not that I'm home sick, but rather that I'm done with Africa?
I reckon it might be.
I think that's why in my head I'm getting that feeling of mad desperation for the finish line.
It's not to go home, it's to leave this continent.
Which is odd.
I don't hold any animosity for Africa. I enjoy being here, in fact. I'm totally here on my own volition and under no duress to continue whatever. The stresses are entirely self-inflicted, and the worry of the unknown isn’t that bad at all. It's *me* who's doing the magnifying.
It's all wonderfully analogous to the marathon. No-one makes me run marathons; I do them out of my own choice. But just like the marathon we're at the halfway mark now and the demons are kicking in. And I want it finished with. This ride is a marathon. At the halfway point the cracks begin to form, they tempt you to panic and lift your speed with all that adrenaline. But, just like in a marathon, it's the last ten clicks where you prove your worth, where you learn something about yourself, where you earn that finish line.
The hard way.
I'm going to earn it.
I *will* keep a level head.
I will not take the temptation to blow out of proportion my fear.
I'll make it. Whenever and however that happens, I'll make it. One stride, one day at a time.
I'm good at this.
---
Another sleepless night.
I wish I had drugs.
With all this lazing around, doing nothing, the body’s not sending the message to my brain that it’s time for lights out.
My mind buzzes from one useless thought onto the next.
It's incredible where the mind runs to when given its reins; at one point I catch myself trying really hard to remember precisely the scene from one of the Mission Impossible movies, the scene where they’re swapping diamonds for nuclear launch codes in a skyscraper in Dubai...
Fuck knows why my head went there, but, rest assured, if I traced it back - thought by thought - it would make sense where that thread started. Somehow.
Makes me wonder where else my brain’s been running off to when I’m not watching.
---
It's bright...
I must have finally nodded off at some point.
The morning's come, all too soon...
I don’t want to go.
Again.
My safe little hovel that I’ve feathered out is dragging on me to stay – just one more day.
But this time I’m not giving myself the option.
After the usual morning grind of a miserly bucket shower, a greasy breakfast, packing up all my shit and humping it out onto the bike in the already filthy heat, I'm away.

## Chapter Fourty Six
I learn from my mistakes.
I stop often, drink often, lunched big and early, piss regularly, stop for photos, slow on the speed, light on the throttle.
Smell the roses.
The ride is so, so much better for it.
I pass the equator, again.
The whole wet and sweaty riding jeans ripping out my arse hair is really starting to give me the willies. So much so that I reckon I might try powdering my bum with talcum powder, like a baby, to keep it dry so that everything slides around like it should.
It's killing me *that much*.
I break after half a day's ride at a place called *Ndjole*. That'll do.
I shack up at a shitty hotel, paying an outrageous 8,000 CFA (twenty-ish bucks).
I think that a lot of sex happens here... The first room I took a look at had playboy bunny sheets. Classy. The playboy bunny room had air conditioning, which doubled the price, so I took the fan room instead.
It’s a pretty cool village, this one. It's situated right on that big wide river I was talking about before - which is still moving at a hell of a clip - and is surrounded by green mountains.
It's got a solid fresh food market, lots of tiny bars and a "strip" where everyone is cooking up mystery meats.
My kind of place.
---
I can’t sleep. Again.
It must be so late...
With two days of very little sleep, and a violent rain smashing on the tin roof, I should be out like a light.
Nope.
I can't stop tossing and turning. Restless.
Someone downstairs starts playing jungle drums...
Loudly...
Fuck them.
Then *bass*. From speakers. Bass so loud and heavy I can *feel* it as much as I can hear it.
Is this place a *club*??
Shithouse.
---
The village is soaked through.
Big, deep puddles everywhere and heavy clouds about, but it's not raining now.
I grab a greasy omelette and coffee, and again I entertain the idea of staying put, using the "wetness" as an excuse.
Not good enough.
I’m locked and loaded by mid-morning.
Before taking off I check the chain tension with my finger. It's actually quite loose. *Really* loose, in fact. That's a bit disturbing, since the last time I tensioned it I probably overdid it, and that was only maybe a thousand clicks ago...
I did Mechanical Engineering 101 (or something like that...) back in university, so I know that this probably means it's in a "plastic deformation" phase (or something like that...) meaning failure is just around the corner. Not good.
But, then again, given that I’ve been sweating on the chain failing ever since France, it's done remarkably well and vastly exceeded all of my expectations.
But that doesn’t mean I won’t be pissed off if it craps out on me in the middle of nowhere...
Right, moving on.
We’re off to national park land.
It’s a great start to the day.
Right off the bat I’m happy to just chug along in 4th gear - the slower the better.
I’m grinning like an idiot and waving to everyone. Today’s only a hundred-ish click jaunt, and it’s always these short days that bring out this slow and happy headspace in me.
It's a great way to travel, and I’m sitting somewhere between happiness and near euphoria.
I love this shit.
I come around a corner and take in a scene in the space of a few seconds.
It’s a checkpoint. It doesn’t look legit... They’re not uniformed, and Gabon’s been pretty tight on that so far. They’re being overly aggressive with people already stopped. There’s lots of yelling. The big guy doing most of the yelling’s got a massive shotgun that he’s making a point of waving around.
*Fuck*.
I pull up because they make me.
This guy’s not into my "Sorry for my bad French, haha, what is your name?" icebreaker routine, he’s straight to business - no pleasantries.
“Insurance.” I give him the Laissez-Passer instead.
“Non! *Insurance*...” Damnit. He gets it.
“Identity card.” I give him my passport this time. I get off the bike and take a drink. He's going through the papers with the bloke with the shotgun; they’re making noises about a permit...
“Permit por-qua?” I ask. He hands me back my papers, squeezes my saddlebags a few times and then without a word just walks off...
*Is that it then??*
Shit, I’m not waiting around to find out.
I’m out of there.
Despite being, I guess, legitimate, it's spooked me. Bad.
Must’ve been the shotgun.
And I was having such a nice morning...
The cheesy euphoria has given way to a drained, deep lethargy.
I feel like shit.
Exhausted in my bones.
I take the turn off for the "N3", my road to the national park.
Stoked: it's still tarmac.
Around the first bend and the tarmac gives way to red dirt...
Figures.
It’s not exactly surprising that they haven’t bothered to tar a road; according to the maps, there's less-than-bugger-all out here.
---
It's a much slower ride and, as always, a bit of a head fuck.
Riding solo off the beaten track is a mind job.
It's remote out here, un-trafficked, hardly any villages to speak of.
If something goes tits up that requires some assistance (because I’ve got no idea what I’m doing) help is going to be a very, *very* long time coming.
And there's no "legging it to the next village" either; there's fucking *no one* out here.
My mind sprints in the hamster wheel of useless, going nowhere, "what ifs".
Busted chain. That's going to suck, but I can probably fix it by myself.
It's the tyres that gets me... Again and again and again; It's the chink in my "what if" armour. I'm not sure if I could do a tyre change with my pissy little tyre irons all by myself. And even if I can, I don't have a pump... Normally, that wouldn't be a problem. Because normally there are people around...
The path is rocky and heavily corrugated.
Puncture-ville.
It'd worth having a simple hand pump in the bag just to get it out of my head.
If something goes wrong, I'm sorta fucked...
Forgetting all that; I'm on a gorgeous red dirt track that hasn’t turned completely to shit in the rain.
We dance together up and down and around deep green mountains, thick with rain forest. The sky is heavily overcast, making it a perfect temperature to ride. The whole thing, and the thumping, sweet Enfield, it’s all a thing of beauty.
And all I can think of, *still*, is something going wrong.
It *shits* me.
It takes a conscious and near constant effort to try to keep my mind positive, and stay in the "here and now". The present - where absolutely nothing is wrong and everything is delightful.
And it *is* delightful.
Just me and the green.
---
After a while in the thick crowding jungle, I blink, and the whole world transforms. Gone is the jungle in a twinkling. Replaced with an utterly cleared, rolling, mountainous grassland, that after the claustrophobia of the jungle seems to go on *forever*.
I’ve got to stop the bike and take a moment...
Stunning.
Jaw dropping...
I love being surprised. Surprised and delighted. This is *awe inspiring*.
The sheer size of the sudden expanse, green grassland all the way to a hilly horizon.
I'm like Bambi on the edge of the meadow.
I wonder if we people only find beauty in *contrasts*. In music, it's the unexpected change in the music that induces shivers up our spine...
I can't tell if this latest change is natural or man-made. Natural doesn't make sense. The altitude, I don't think, shifted *that* much. But man made doesn't check-out either; the area seems too *vast*. Plus, if you log an area you don't get grasslands, you get shitty little trees and saplings. Here, there’s nothing but grass and hills and mountains forever and ever.
As I crack on into the grasslands, letting the weight of the bike roll us down a decline, I’ve got my arms spread out, flying down the hill. I'm yelling into my helmet
"*This is what it's all about!! This is it*!"
And it is.
*This* is why I wanted to go exploring; it's to be as thoroughly wowed as this.
In an instant it feels like the whole journey has been vindicated, again.
I try my horn again. I feel like making some noise.
On the third push it comes to life again! Scares me!
Even the Enfield is healing out here.
---
As we get closer to our destination - *Lope* - a river comes along. It’s a *huge* bastard. I think it might be the same one as before, but here it seems to be somehow both wider and faster.
It’s *immense* and absolutely ripping along.
A fearsome beautiful thing.
I love it out here.
---
I cruise into Lope somewhere in the afternoon.
I follow some signs to a hotel sort of lodge sort of thing. It's a long way out of the main village but it looks pretty decent so I reckon I’ll have a crack.
I ask how much for a night and I *swear* they say 520,000 CFA. I double check. Then triple check.
I’m sure of it.
Divide that by 450…
That’s over a thousand bucks.
For one night!
Bloody hell.
*Surely not*.
I don't know any other number that sounds like “sank sant vant mill.” Sank, five. Sant, hundred. Vant, twenty. Mill, thousand.
Fuck a duck.
Back to Lope then...
---
I quickly find another joint. It's perfect. Ideal.
It's the best value place I've found in Gabon, by a long way. 5,500cfa for the night - the cheapest in Gabon by something like half.
It's clean. It has a mosquito net. The communal shower works a treat. So does the toilet. The sheets are even new and vibrant and colourful.
I’m totally stoked with it.
Lope is *a lot* smaller than I had expected. It's so small in fact, that there's nowhere that sells petrol...
I was assuming, and fairly, that just like the rest of Africa there'd be *someone* selling bottles of petrol.
Nope.
While I’m chowing down a whole chicken deep fried out of all recognition (fucking delicious mind you), I ask the chef how much further along till there's petrol.
*Two hundred and eighty clicks* down the road...
Fuck fuck fuck *fuck*.
Why the hell didn’t I add some more juice in at the last stop!
Idiot!
Fuck *shit*!
The last time I refuelled was... what? Fifty clicks outside Libreville, on the way *into* Libreville.
-ish...
So that means fifty clicks plus yesterdays ride of 250-ish, plus today's ride of 120-ish. That makes 420km.
Four hundred and twenty kilometres since I last refuelled...
That's a lot.
I chow the rest of the chicken and go check The Shrike.
Enfields don't have a fuel gauges...
I have to pop the cap and rock the bike around.
There’s fuck all swishing around in there...
How the *hell* did I not think of this?
With this much fuel I’ll be lucky to make it back the hundred plus clicks back the way I came without having to get off and push...
As for going 280 clicks forward? Forget about it.
*Fuck!*
I head back to the "restaurant", and ask the chef if there's anyone in the village with petrol in jars.
He doesn’t think so. He heads off to make enquiries.
He quickly comes back and it's good news, the bloke down the road about a kilometre sells jars of “essence”.
Thank *fuck* for that.
I kill the afternoon by taking a walk of the tiny village, and then sit on a log and read a book till the mozzies come out and force me to move on.
I head off to the part of the village with the guy who sells fuel.
He's fresh out...
*FUCK!*
I plead but he really does have nothing. Not a drop.
Alternatives...
Siphon fuel and pay someone? The big hotel might have their own supply.
Then it hits me like a thunder bolt - I *did* fill up after Libreville. How did I forget about that??
Jesus I must've been out of my mind...
Crisis averted.
This next leg might be a tight one though!
---
Finally, a good night’s sleep is in the books.
Halle-fuckin-lujah.
I head to breakfast with my mate the greasy chicken chef. 1,300 coins for an omelette with coffee. Three dollars. Bloody pricey, this joint.
First item on today’s agenda is where to find the next petrol along to road heading east. Apparently the place to go is called Lastoursville. That's good, I’ve seen that on the maps, it's only a couple of hundred clicks away. I *should* be able to get that done on the current tank of juice. Good good.
I then ask about Koulamoutou - the next town along the line. Yep, that's got petrol as well.
Bonza. All's looking good.
I ask the chef about the road from Koulamoutou to Ndende?
He says the road's no good.
Shit. I poke my head out the door and point up to the road where I came from yesterday, a useful benchmark. Like that?
No. He then does his best charades of bouncing a motorbike into a craterous pothole...
Fuck.
It’s only just now occurred to me that I never stopped to think and re-assess the plan after yesterday’s ride. Seems crazy in hindsight.
Better late than never. Yesterday’s one hundred clicks of breaking new ground on the “N3” took me roughly 3 hours. It wouldn't have been safe to go much faster given the corrugations and the rocks. In the whole ride there wasn't a single real functioning village. A few abandoned villages here and there and maybe the occasional one or two with a human. No places to stay, no petrol, no food. Not much traffic either, maybe a vehicle every half hour, I reckon. And this is the N3 - a major road - the connection between the capital and “Franceville”, which, I’m told, is the third largest city in the country.
It never occurred to me that the roughly three hundred click road from Koulamoutou to Ndende - from nowhere to nowhere - might be an untraveled, empty, nightmare of a road.
It’s occurring to me now though...
And, just like that, bang, it goes from looking totally do-able to crazy. This isn't like Liberia or Cote d'Ivoire where there’s a bunch of small rural villages on the road that I can use as a get out of jail free card should the shit hit the fan.
No.
I know I can make it to Koulamoutou, I know I can make it to Franceville if need be. But what happens from there? Three hundred *offroad* clicks in a day? I don't think it's possible. Not for me...
And then what? Where are you going to sleep? What are you going to eat? What if something goes wrong? What if the road is impassable? What if you get sick? What if you have a prang?
What if? What if? What if?
What if you do something as simple as puncture a tyre, and there's zero traffic. Lie back and think of England. Because you're fucked.
Literally, if just about anything doesn't go just right, in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, you've *had it*.
There's being adventurous and then there's being stupid and reckless. All of a sudden I've crossed the line. "Death by misadventure" again.
I’m not happy with this, at all. Even though I know it might all end in tears I still want to crack on; I *hate* backtracking and yesterday's left me with an appetite to see more of Gabon.
The other option is to go a little further south east of Lastoursville to a place called Moanda, and then head south to cross into the Congo. But that leaves 200km of unknown Congo back roads, with no alternatives, which might be even less appealing than the Gabon "N6".
It's not looking good.
I don't even have the time to go and have a look and then, if it’s a balls up, retrace my steps; my Gabon visa ends in under a week, to get to the Congo border from Franceville, the long way around, is a colossal distance, and on a lot of dirt to boot.
Fuck it all.
I’m going back the way I came.
And I hate myself for it.
What’s worse? To regret that you’re a pansy? Or to regret that you’re an idiot?
I wish I wasn’t alone out here. It’d be a different story altogether.
---
While I’m getting my shit in a pile to take off I get talking to a couple of truckers who are sitting about, taking the air. I explain to the truckers what I wanted to do and they tell me that the road from Franceville to Dolisie via Oyo is all paved, “pas de problem.”
Bullshit! *Paved*! You serious??
The pendulum swings, again.
I run off to grab my GPS so I can find Oyo, excited that I might have just snagged a life.
And... Nope.
Well, not really.
Oyo is *way* out east, near Cameroon. Sort of. The route they were describing was Franceville-Oyo-Brazzaville-Dolisie. All of it has been 'mac'd. Apparently.
I'd rather avoid Brazzaville if I can...
I explain to the truckers that I want to go from Moanda to Dolisie.
Nope. According to the truckers, the road's no good.
The pendulum swings right back again.
I give up, load up The Shrike and get ready to peel out.
I'm about to turn on the bike when by habit I reach into my pocket to grab the GPS.
It's not there...
The cold fizz in the head and frantic pat of every pocket followed by a statue - One hand on my arse pocket, the other clasping my inner jacket pocket.
*Shit!*
I fly back to the room, which, as is my custom, was already turned upside down before I left, so I turn it right side up again.
Nothing. Where the *fuck* would it be? Did I leave it at breakfast? No. Ah!! It's in the toilet, that’s it, I remember!
Big strides down the hallway to the communal toilet.
It's not there.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck *FUCK!!* Someone's taken it, either to steal it, or maybe to report it lost.
In my head - concurrent with the panic - I'm already thinking of how I'll travel without it. Thinking of how I'll make it work; it's a fairly critical bit of kit and it's almost irreplaceable in this part of the world - you just can’t buy them. My head is a blur but already I'm making plans for how it will all be ok. And this is all happening between the ears in the fractions of seconds it takes me to close the toilet door. The brain and all those panic chemicals can be a hell of a thing.
Then it hits me, the shower!
And yes, thank Christ, there it is. I'd put it down to wash my hands and then left it there on the sill.
*Fark mee*.
I breathe again.
Very lucky to jag that one.
That's quite enough excitement for one morning...
Take two. Let's get out of here.
---
I absolutely flog it back the way I came.
I know that it’s not necessary, but sometimes I just feel the need for speed. I've seen the scenery already so I’ve got no qualms about gluing my eyes to the road and just hammering it.
It’s great fun.
The combo of familiarity with the track, and the fact it’d dried out some overnight, brought on a bit of a loss of respect and an increase in complacency.
I’m moving fast and fancy free.
Bang. Right out of fucking nowhere with no warning around a blind corner there’s a fucking speeding truck.
I’ve got to react like a mongoose.
I nearly get murdered.
Because I’m all alone out here I’ve been using *all* of the dirt road to pick out the best, smoothest track. Left side, right side, right up the middle, it didn’t matter.
I was on the wrong side of the road.
No time to think and I swerve the bike over, hard to the side, and miss the truck by *nothing.*
I still can’t believe it didn’t hit my back wheel.
Tweak a couple of the variables, either speed, reaction time, a bit sooner or a bit later on the corner from either of us, him in the middle of the track, a little less luck and I’m dead.
Scared the absolute shit out of me.
I have to pull over to walk off the shakes.
Helmet off and it’s all quiet again. Peaceful, calm, still and serene.
No one’s dying.
I’m side saddle on the bike calming down and looking absently into the jungle when the tree right behind me on the roadside starts rustling I turn in a snap to see what it is, but it’s stopped.
I stare at it, hard. Even though it's was just spitting distance away I can't see a thing.
It sounded very close... But it’s quiet now.
There’s another movement in the corner of my eye, away to the right, way up the road, and I turn to Look. High in the trees, maybe fifty steps away, there’s branch moving, like something's just jumped off it or onto it. Must be monkeys...
I’m straining to catch a glimpse. Straining to hear something.
But everything is quiet and calm again.
A snort like a furious bull comes from out of nowhere, right next to my head, *roaring* through the silence.
I *shit a cinder block*.
I snap my head to look back into the jungle behind me and in the same motion swing my leg over the bike.
I blindly twist the key and hit the ignition without taking my eyes off the green and I *get the fuck out of there.*
I didn't see *anything*. Nothing.
Do they have fucking *gorillas* here??
Jesus tap-dancing *Christ*. Why didn't anyone tell me they have fucking gorillas!? It couldn't have been anything other than a very pissed off gorilla; an elephant wouldn't fit in jungle that thick.
I'd love to see a gorilla; but not that fucking close... All I can imagine is King Kong pealing out of the jungle and ripping my limbs off.
There was menace in that snort. Like whatever the fuck it was wanted to send a clear message: Fuck, off.
Message received...
My heart won't stop.
And here I was worried about trucks...
---
Not long after shitting a metaphoric brick, I start to drop my guts with a disturbing, unusual regularity.
Big one's...
Ominous.
Trucks be damned. I *fly*.
As I get back to the tarmac road I’m starting to cramp up. Badly.
Not good...
*Really* not good.
I wring the throttle and smash the tarmac like a man possessed.
I make amazing progress, but I already know it's in vain.
We've been here before; it was on a boat off the shore of Guinea-Bissau...
I *will not* tempt fate again.
I concede defeat, pull over, and run into the jungle.
*Whoosh...*
That gorilla's *literally* scared the shit out of me.
The jungle insects come out of the woodwork for this.
I think of a huge gorilla sneaking up on me while I'm taking a furious shit.
March flies are already biting my arse.
At least I hope they're march flies...
Even though I'm not entirely evacuated I reckon it's enough to make it back to Ndjole without further incident.
All in all, not as harrowing an experience as I thought it would be.
Excepting the boat incident, it's my first unsupervised crap in the wild. I'm almost proud of myself.
Nah, bugger it, I *am* proud of myself.
So what?
---
I pull into Ndjole, again.
I’ll be buggered if I’m staying in the seedy joint with the playboy sheets and the rave happening downstairs again. Stuff that.
I try a joint called the “hotel de ville”, which sounds like it must be evil and kidnap dalmatian puppies...
I interrupt a bloke taking a kip out on the front porch in the sunshine. He's a bit confused when I ask for a room. I ask again. He looks genuinely confused... tells me no, there are no rooms.
What?? No rooms in a *hotel*.
No.
We both just stare at each other. He seems to be as confused as I am.
None of it makes any sense.
In any case, it seems that that’s not an option, so I wish him a nice day and go head to my hotel/nightclub.
Same room and everything.
---
Still can't sleep.
I'm sick of this sucky foam mattress. It's another one of those one's that you just drown in.
Tossing and turning, then I *feel* something big crawl onto my head from the pillow.
*Big* big. 
Calmly I swish it off my forehead with a flick of the wrist (calmly?? How the hell am I so calm??). It goes flying over to the side of the bed. I scramble for a light.
It’s the biggest cockroach I’ve seen in my life. Some abomination of nature. One of those huge flying bastards.
Yuck.
How the *hell* has it got past the mozzie net??
I can’t believe how calm I am. How calm I was. I would have expected that an unexpected visitor on my head in the middle of the dark night would have scared the bejeezus out of me and left me dancing a wild, slapping jig.
*Especially* after seeing that bird eating spider the other day...
I lift up the mozzie net and backhander the roach somewhere across the room. Live and let live, right?
Plus, if I smush the thing it’s going to make a hell of a mess.
---
Over days the beauty of Gabon fades.
I'm just getting the miles done to get to the border.
The road is in good nick, and I make good progress.
There’s lots of very small villages, so there’s no need to worry about getting in the shit – there’s always an easy out.
On the road there’s always waving, screaming, smiling kids, and friendly villagers, always ready with a big smile and a wave.
They’re a very friendly bunch.
Except where it comes to animals...
There’s obviously a very healthy "bushmeat" trade happening in these villages, and the wares are displayed on the roadside for potential buyers.
There ain’t no wildlife conservation here. No sir...
I’ve seen a *tonne* of animals strung up.
There are creatures that look like a gofer sort of rat that are the size of dogs; small crocodiles or alligators or whatever; jungle cats, yep, flecking jungle cats! They look like a spotted leopard mixed with a large house cat. Shame it’s dead, it'd make an awesome pet; there are tiny pygmy antelope looking things; another great pet if it wasn't dead; and then something that looks like an armadillo. I don’t even know what an armadillo looks like, but I reckon this is something like it - it looks like it’d roll up in a ball for self-defence; I even see a *toucan*, or I’m guessing it’s a toucan. It looks like the cartoon versions of a toucan that I know, anyway. Huge beak, colourful. Dead.
And then there’s the monkeys. They’re ubiquitous.
And terrible.
The worst.
The post-mortal cruelty ratchets a notch for these tragic monkeys...
It’s like the locals have a little competition going to see who can put on the *least* humane display. It’s full on.
Some are hung up by the arms like they’ve been crucified; some by the legs, upside down; some by their tail which is also tied around their neck like a choking noose; some are cooked and splayed open like a starfish, gutted right up their middle. All of them have a grotesque grimace on their face, teeth bared, like they are frozen in the agony of their death. The eyes are the most disturbed, locked in a squint of terrible pain.
It makes me shudder every time. It’s fucking awful.
How does anyone find that *appetising*?? Who's eating this??
Anyway, it’s been a few days of long rides, shitty accommodations, and all in all, fairly uneventful.
About the only thing worth noting was running into a couple of travellers in a van while at a rare Gabonese checkpoint. They were a young couple from Switzerland. Two modern-day hippies.
We did the whole "you're white, I'm white, we should probably talk" thing.
Their van did a transformer routine, and out comes a picnic bench and seats.
We pored over maps and shared war stories.
They’re doing a lap of Africa in the other direction to me – going down the east coast and now coming up the west.
The adventurous are always interesting, or maybe it was all the choof they’d been smoking - the van reeked of it.
Anywho. They reckon that the east coast was a little too touristy and a little too developed. I assured them that the west coast wouldn’t have the same problem...
They reckon that Angola was a breeze, and all of the roads have been ‘mac'd.
*Brilliant*.
They tell me to be ready for a bit of a grind though, as the roads in Congo are a bit shit. Muddy, apparently. Though I'm sure that after nothing but tarmacked roads for them that they struggled with any wet dirt road...
They reckon that the Congolese - in both countries - were the nicest people they had met so far on the trip. *Big call*. And the border crossings are a breeze; no one ever gave them any grief.
All good news then!
I tell them not to be scared of Nigeria, and that Yamoussoukro is not to be missed.
It's odd that I don’t have much more to tell them.
They’ll figure it out.
Anyhow, it was nice, if only for a little while, to see other travellers; it's been since Ghana since I've met any other travellers out on the road.
Made for a cheerful afternoon ride.
---
Early to rise.
That familiar rising dread. It must be a border day.
Sixth day straight in the saddle.
My guts has taken it to the next level overnight, despite me not giving it too much ammunition in the top end.
It’s been about an hour of throne time in total across five different attempts trying to clear this cramp. I reckon I’ve sort of got it in the end, at least as well as I’m going to for today.
Fingers crossed there’s no more emergency evacuations.
It's three hundred clicks between here and Dolisie, with nothing in between on the maps except a border.
Even though three hundred clicks is big, I have to get it done, there are no alternatives.
---
While I’m brimming the Shrike with fuel I get a bloke interrupting me, telling me to come and see him at 'Immigration' before I leave.
Hmmm. Not sure I will...
I reckon it’s just another official wanting to be a pain in the neck, and I usually avoid that sort of thing. Plus, we're nowhere near the border yet.
But, thinking about it, and how it all went down with the Gabonese on the way in, with the stamps all happening miles away from the border actual, I reckon I’ve got to check it out.
I ride over to where the random bloke was directing me, and it's legit.
Thank fuck I stopped here and didn't get turned around at the border to come back, a good forty clicks away; an eighty click round trip.
That would have sucked. Hard. My long day would have become impossible.
They stamp my passport.
---
About an hour out of Ndende, on not-so-bad-road, I hit the Gendarmes who catch all of my details. It’s just one bloke in a gutted out house, all by himself. Then it’s on to the border post proper.
I’m not sure what these blokes are, but they want *all* my details.
They offer me some palm wine, and then ask for some money for whisky.
With a bit more hassle than usual, I’m out of Gabon.
It’s been fun.

## Chapter Fourty Seven
Hello, Congo!
It doesn’t even sound like a country. It sounds more like a mystical, made up place.
“The Congo...”
There's no more evocative a name anywhere on the continent.
The border post is butted up against a gate on the road, with a few buildings and some other clingers-on.
Getting into “The Congo” turns out to be equally a hassle; everyone wants my details and papers but no one wants to give me what I need.
The Police, then two lots of Gendarmes, and then the Douane. And I've still got no stamps or papers. Nothing.
It’s all taking a bloody long time. Time I don't have.
I'm anxious to get going
On the second trip to the cops I get my stamp - they didn't want to stamp me in till they were sure that I'd been to see *everybody*.
Apparently I can get papers for the bike later; as there’s no one between here and Dolisie to give me the shits anyway...
I’m about to head off but one of the cops is trying to tell me something.
My French isn’t really good enough to catch it... He’s talking about a *path*, or something to do with *listening*. I’ve got no idea what he’s driving at.
I apologise and ask him to repeat himself - and he does - but it’s in one ear and out the other. I can’t catch any of it, which is a shame because he seems pretty earnest about it. I'm a little embarrassed...
I apologise again and he gives up, wishes me good luck, and I'm off.
I round the first corner, and straight away I'm faced with an impossibly long puddle.
Fucking hell.
It just keeps *going*.
I spend a good minute with the bike in idle, hand on the clutch, just staring at it, because I can’t do anything else...
It’s impossible. Impassable.
I know already it can’t be done. It’s too big.
Something tells me it's deep. I can just *tell*.
Hopeless...
The dirt road is lined with African scrub so thick that I’m no chance to bush bash around it. And even if I could, there’d probably be mud under that too...
The dry scrub is higher than my head. Like a stone wall....
The nearest other road is two *hundred* kilometres away.
This is it. For the next three hundred clicks: *this...* 
What *the fuck* am I supposed to do now?
Nothing else for it but to have a crack. I guess... What else can I do?
Before I have the chance, two kids from the border village have come running and jumping and screaming out of the scrub.
They're waving for me to follow them into the scrub.
They sherpa me off to the side where there’s a tiny, hidden bypass track.
Thank *Christ*.
I scratch the Shrike through the scrub, and pop out into what looks like the cleared front yard of someone’s hut... That’s a bit rude, and none too subtle...
The track wind’s around other huts parallel to the road. *Everyone’s* staring at me as the kids lead me around the huts and scrub like the pied piper.
We poke back out onto the road at the other end of the puddle.
Excellent!! Thanks kids!
---
It's one deep muddy quagmire after another, some of them are properly deep; the trucks have come through and carved out *deep* tyre tracks that fill with brown water. It's impossible to gauge how deep a puddle is until I'm swimming in it. Well, that's not true, I *could* get off the bike and walk it first, but doing that every half-click for three hundred clicks isn't exactly a practical solution...
Anyway, from what I’ve learnt in Cameroon, puddles usually look a lot worse than they are. I just have to do my best to divine the right track and go for it.
Left side, right side, down the middle. Pick and go.
I pick a right.
Go for it.
The bike buries the front tyre into watery mud and I lose momentum fast. The exhaust note drowns with the pipe going under the water.
*We’re not going to make it.*
I *wring* the throttle but we're still slowing down.
Progress is down to inches at a time. *We're not even half-way.*
The engine’s still giving a muffled roar, as I vault off the bike and into the puddle, keeping the throttle pinned.
I push. I push but instead of the bike moving forward my legs just sink deeper backwards into the mud.
Up to the knee.
Every straining inch I gain by pushing and lifting is lost again when I reset to have another push, sucked back into the mud.
The motor is screaming; the tyre is just a water-wheel of brown. 
Wet brown shit's going *everywhere.*
I can't stop. If I stop, it's over.
I take two deep breaths. I give it all I’ve got. I throw my whole body into it. This is my *only* shot. It *has to* work.
I can *feel* the adrenaline, the kind of adrenaline that lets people lift flipped cars.
Five seconds of ultimate effort.
I make no progress.
There are *meters* left to go.
I can't.
I stop pushing.
The throttle is still going, the wheel still spinning.
I can't let it stop. Can't.
But what else can I do?
I panic.
With another bolt of adrenaline I heave again.
The veins in my head are going to explode under the pressure.
The bike moves forward an inch.
I push again.
It *has to work!!*
Nothing. It doesn't move at all.
I roll off the throttle and the engine dies with a plop and a bubble.
*Silence.*
I look around. All at once I realise how completely alone I am out here.
How isolated. How vulnerable. How very not bulletproof.
I can feel my neck tighten. Choking up. Mouth turns down.
Like I'm about to *cry*...
Jeesus. Must be bad...
I let go of the handlebars and the bike just stands there all by itself; the mud’s that thick that it’s holding it upright.
Welcome to the Congo...
---
Alright then. SitRep.
The Shrike can die in three different ways:
One, the exhaust pipe fills with mud and water that the engine can’t clear the blockage, choking it.
Two, the motorbikes "computer", is right on the mudline, if water gets into that box with the electronics it's gonna be game over.
Three, the air box, which is on the other side of the bike, is also just above the mudline. If mud gets sucked through the air box and into the engine where things go “bang”, who knows what that could do...
Any one of them will be fatal for the bike, and might even kill the journey.
And that’s just the showstoppers, the lesser impacts of covering everything in thick mud can’t be great.
Oright. Better get on with it.
The back wheel has dug a watery hole down past the axle.
The saddlebags are *just* clear of the mudline, but they’ve still copped a shitload of mud from the back tyre painting everything brown.
I reckon that without the bags and me sitting on the Shrike I might be able to push it out of the shit.
I chuck the bags, the spare tyre and the tent into the scrub.
I suck in a few deep ones, getting ready for another ultimate effort.
Turn the key and hit the ignition, The Shrike fires up without a moment’s hesitation. I can't believe it... I drop the clutch, pin the throttle and push like hell.
Without the saddlebags to parry and block the mud it’s making a right fuckin mess.
Mud fills the sky.
Regardless of the lighter weight, we're going nowhere fast.
I let the engine die again.
I try lifting the front and then the back wheel out of the mud.
It's the biggest effort I've made, just a straight up deadlift where I can use *all* of my strength.
Each effort buys me an inch up and out of the mud. But the moment I stop straining it gets sucked right back down to square one. 
I'm *not* going to be able to do this by myself.
Time to wait. I guess.
---
Ok, it’s obvious that no one’s coming.
Despite this being the main border with Gabon, it’s not particularly popular – I’ve hardly seen anyone on this road since I started out this morning. Hours ago.
There's no option. I've got to walk back to the border.
I sling the muddy saddlebags over my shoulder. I'm past caring about a little more mud now. I'm caked with a thick layer of wet brown from my boots to my waist, with flicks of brown covering the rest of me pell-mell.
It looks like I've been dipped in chocolate.
I grab my jacket too, and wetly trudge it back to the border post, mud squirming between my toes.
I don't even go around the puddles; my boots can't get any wetter...
---
I've already got raging blisters on my feet.
I feel knackered.
---
I'm finally within cooee of the border post when I hear motorbikes coming from the direction I’ve *just come from*.
They've managed to negotiate the mud...
I stop and drop my bags and wait for them.
Around the corner come two scooters.
Two tinny little Chinese made *scooters*. 
*SCOOTERS!?*
How the actual fuck have they made it through the shit??
Unbelievable. I literally do-*not*-believe it.
It must be written on my face.
The first bloke to ride past me just laughs at me and keeps going.
The second bloke is *pissed off*.
He’s chewing me right out, pointing in my face and giving me an angry earful in French. I'm not sure what he's saying, but I know I'm being chastised... He's waving his arm around, pointing back in the direction of The Shrike.
Wait... Did he just call me an idiot??
*Crazy* was definitely in there: *"Foo"*.
I can't make any sense of any of this - the whole situation.
Why is *he* pissed. What's it to him? How's it any skin off his nose that I'm stuck?
The dots just don't join up...
Now he’s yelling something about a *"piste"*. A path. Something about “making your own path” or some shit like that.
Despite looking fucking miserable, and covered in shit, neither one of them offers to help me out. They ride on to the border post...
*Arseholes*.
---
The scooter riders have given the handful of people at the village the story before I can: the dumb-fuck is stuck in the mud, because he’s a fucking idiot...
It was written all over me in mud anyway.
The only explanation I’ve got to offer is a shrug and a sheepish grin.
No other explanations required.
I think they’re gonna help me.
No one actually says it, but I get the feeling they’re gonna give me a hand.
But they’re in no rush.
About half an hour of sitting about later, killing time, a group of four who have a truck finally finish their lunch and hop into their truck. There’s no space for me in the cab through, and so, exhausted, and with really pissed off feet, I’ve got to trudge back to the bike through the mud again.
---
It’s a long, quiet walk.
---
They’ve beaten me back to the bogged bike by a fair bit, and two of them have already stripped down to nothing but their underwear and waded barefoot into the mud. They're trying to lift the bike out on their own. Wasn’t expecting that... Neither three naked blokes, nor for them to be making such an effort without me.
But they’re not going far fast, the suction of the mud is too strong.
I drop my bags and wade in to give them a hand.
Even with three of us it’s a struggle, the mud is just too *awkward*.
With a full effort from all three of us we manage to break the pull of the sucking mud and haul the bike out backwards and back onto dry land.
She’s an absolute mess.
*Covered* in shit. There’s mud *everywhere*.
The truck driver offers to put the bike in the back of the truck so we can take it to a mechanic to fix it.
Good chance...
I bang the keys in, press the ignition and she starts.
Everyone's surprised.
I give it a few revs and the exhaust pipe vomits a lot of mud and water.
Projectile vomiting.
It clears. The Shrike seems pretty content. Just another day...
Unbelievable.
I’m grinning like an idiot.
You *can’t* kill this bike. You just *can't*.
What a fucking warrior.
The Congo lads are nodding their head in approval.
“Il est fort eh?”
Yeah. It's strong alright.
---
While I’m loading up again - and wondering what to do now - I can overhear the blokes who lifted the bike talking in hushed tones about 5,000 CFA. I don’t think that they think that I have a very good handle of French. I come up to them with a 10,000FA.
They’re even more stoked with the cash than I am with having the Shrike back... They’re literally thrilled.
One of the scooter's are back; looks like they were just doing a round-trip to the border.
He offers to Sherpa me through the shit.
Thank Christ. I won’t be alone.
I fire up the Shrike and brace myself.
I'm curious to see how he's going to handle this puddle that I apparently got so wrong as to meerit a tongue lashing.
Good luck!
He gets a run up and then just vanishes off the road and into the scrub.
*What the fuck?* Where’s he gone? How’d he do that??
I turn the Shrike around and sure enough, there’s a tiny, scratchy goat track that’s been hidden by the thick scrub.
The whole fuzzy picture of nonsense finally snaps into focus in a blink.
*That’s* the way of it...
---
Most of the puddles we still have to go through - and make a mess - but for every one that looks impossible to pass there’s *always* a hidden little goat track somewhere.
Imagine if I had of gotten bogged any further from the border... a hundred kilometres from the border...
*Lucky,* really; getting bogged was *inevitable* without this nugget of know-how.
What I thought of as the worst luck ever got revealed to have been *incredibly* lucky.
This road is without a doubt a top contender for the worst roads of the trip.
Just a bloody mess.
My Sherpa guided me till we reached his mud hut village, and I’m on my own again; but this time I know enough to get it done.
---
I’m tuckered out. Knackered.
Two hours of hard yakka.
I hit a benign looking crest in the middle of two puddled tyre tracks and in the blink of an eye front end slides out sideways like it's on soap, and everything goes for a splash.
The bike into the right tyre puddle, me into the left.
The engine cuts out.
Fucking. Great.
I’ve had enough. The last five riding day’s in succession and then this clusterfuck, all come home to roost at once in the spill. And there’s *still* riding to be done...
I lie face down in the puddle doing a half push up. What a wreck.
I pick myself up, and then pick up the Shrike.
It starts.
We're off again.
I go a ways up the road and pull over for a drink and a break. I need it.
I check that my travel papers and money in my breast pocket aren’t wet...
They are.
*Fuck this!*
The bottom of my passport is damp and brown at the bottom with mud. And the rest of the documents are all a little damp as well.
I guess it could have been worse...
Been saying that a lot today...
---
The rest of the afternoon goes like a hamster wheel. It feels like I’m making no progress at all, and the kilometres being ticked off by the GPS feel like they take an age each.
There are tiny, tiny villages scattered here and there, and when I go past I don’t get any waves. The villagers run out of their huts at me, yelling, and not in a pleasant way either...
They want me to stop... But I don't.
---
It feels very late as I come across the biggest village since the border. Which isn’t saying much. In fact, that’s saying nothing at all. It’s a handful of dingy buildings and a Customs post.
I’m shattered.
I’ve had nothing to eat today except for three bananas for breakfast and a stale baguette for lunch back when I was waiting around at the border post all covered in mud; not nearly enough for today's exertions.
There’s still a couple of *hundred* clicks to Dolisie. I’m not even going to get within cooee of that today, or maybe even tomorrow for that matter.
The Shrike’s starting to sound a little crook too; that tonking noise from Cameroon is back...
The lad at Customs tells me there’s a hotel around the corner down by the river.
That’ll do.
The Douane lad will happily write me a Passavant. That’s a plus.
While he’s doing that I head off to find the hotel.
---
It's a pile of shit.
5,000 CFA a night. Outrageous.
But beggars can’t be choosers...
While I’m offloading my shit I watch my host go grab a bucket of brown water from the muddy riverbank for me to take a shower in.
River water... In *The Congo*...
Suboptimal.
That bucket must be a fucking petri dish...
Speaking of petri dishes; the room.
Good. Lord.
This might be the crappiest place I've ever stayed in.
Yep, I’m calling it.
The crappiest.
It’s dank and dingy and foul smelling.
I’m not sure I’d be happy to stand barefoot on that mattress, I don’t know how I’m going to sleep on it...
And don't get me started on that pillow...
Now, my standards have become pretty low on this trip for accommodation, and I can deal with rank hotel rooms without much fuss, but this is beyond the pale.
In a word: Filthy.
But, there are more pressing matters at hand: The Shrike.
---
Mud. Fuckloads of it.
It's *everywhere*.
Each time I want a new bucket of river water I have to go *barefoot* down the steep muddy riverbank to collect it.
After taking a few trips I cog that those gnarly, fat blisters I picked up today on my feet have burst wide open, and filled with filthy mud.
That can’t be good...
I’m so *done* with this.
I leave the Shrike after doing my best to wash off what I can, and now it's my turn. I head inside and clean myself up with that river water bucket shower.
I leave my jeans in another bucket of water to soak all the chocolate mud out, and head to the "village" for lunch.
---
I pick up the Passavant, which is only valid for a week...
I quaff a pretty iffy lunch of rice with some some very gnarly cubes of mystery meat.
On the way out of the restaurant I make a friend.
He’s made a beeline at me in the hope that I speak English - because he does.
We have a chat.
As part of the small talk, I ask him what the people eat here in the village.
“Monkey”.
“*Monkey???* Okay... Right... Sure... *What else* do you eat?”
“Just monkey”.
Fuck. Monkey…
Jesus…
Cubes of god damn *monkey.* I prefered it when it was a mystery...
Anyway... Apparently, the road to Dolisie is “very, very bad” and it’s going to take eight hours to ride there, *at best*.
Great.
Fuckin. Great.
What scares me the most is that no one who ever gave me advice ever *over*-estimated the time taken for a ride; in my experience you can safely tack on a few extra hours to what anyone tells you... 
I reckon that I could do an eight-hour-plus slog if I was fresh, but I’m not.
What other option is there though?
---
Dinner is two oranges in the light of an old kerosene lamp in my shitbox.
Morale is at an all-time low.
I can feel myself choking up for the second time today.
I’m right on the edge of a complete burnout or breakdown or some other b word. I can feel it.
I’m in trouble. *I’m not ok.*
I’m so *alone*.
I'm lying on my bed. My floor is covered in mud (my fault), my room smells like a swamp (my fault), and the bed reeks of old sex (someone else’s fault). I'm lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, just so that I don't have to touch this pillow with anything except for the back of my head.
After a day like today I ought to be counting my blessings... Absolutely everything is working at the end of the day when it had no right to be.
I broke nothing.
I'm in a bed.
I have food.
I have money.
I don't *live* in this place. Seriously; not living here is enough of a blessing to put my life into perspective. I get to *leave*.
I seriously need to count my blessings and fix my attitude. No one and nothing else chooses my attitude but me...
I've been very "woe is me" of late, and that's *bullshit*. My life is incredible. Who gets to *do* this shit?
Not many, if any.
I'm healthy. I'm safe. All of the problems that I'm having start between the ears, and I'm the only one who can fix that up...
This is, actually, what it's all about. Well, what it was *supposed* to be about anyway; being tested. Embracing the grind.
The last 10k...
That’s what this is.
How do I respond?
Panic? Fear? Freak right the fuck out? Run home?
Or get on with it.
Africa was never meant to be easy; I never came here for easy.
Welcome to the challenge. Enjoy yourself.
Smile, ya wanker.
---
I snap awake to a demented rooster throwing the first salvo of the day’s shouting match.
Half my face and my open mouth are smeared up against my pillow that smells like someone’s done a lot of fucking *on* it.
Fucking delightful.
I check the time; it’s 3am. It's not even in the *ballpark* of dawn, but all the other roosters wake up and take up the chorus anyway.
Motherfuckers.
Good morning Congo.
---
A few hours of on and off sleep later I hear something scratching around in my room.
*Inside* my room. *Scratching*.
Whoever coined the phrase "as quiet as a mouse" didn't know what the fuck they were talking about.
Or is it a rat? It *sounds* big...
Do I do something about it?
No...
*Aaaargh* but what if it makes a little rat nest in my saddlebags and shits everywhere and eats everything?
What if it crawls into bed with me?
*Fuck it.*
Up I get and follow the noise with my flashlight over to the bathroom.
It’s a rat.
I interrupt it taking a bath. It's wringing wet. I'm not sure if that's from the toilet or from my water bucket...
When the light beam hits it it shits its pants. Freaks *right* out. It *bolts* for the drainage hole in the floor in a flash - and shoves its head into it.
No good. Won’t fit.
Not even close.
It pulls its head out of the hole and rams it in again, and again, and again, and again.
It won’t stop.
For the longest time it just keeps head banging the pipe while I just watch it, not sure what to do with myself; I haven't moved a muscle.
Finally it joins the dots that that idea ain’t gonna fly and changes tack, making a flying run at the toilet, launching *into* the bowl and it just disappears into god knows what awfulness...
Well... That was unexpected...
*What next?*
---
I’m as stiff as a board when the sun rises, and not in the customary way. I feel like death warmed up. *Rigor mortis*. I can hardly move I’m that sore. My muscles complain with the slightest movement.
I know that yesterday was tiring, but I’d no idea it was anything like *this* bad.
I feel like I've torn every muscle in my whole body from trying to lift The Shrike out of the bog yesterday.
To ride on today would be asking for trouble, both physically and mentally.
I’m not ready for it.
Physically I can't do *eight* hours more of yesterday; not on top of seven days straight in the saddle already, back to back to back...
Mentally I feel on the edge of something snapping. If I don't have a *perfect* riding day (and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't), I question my ability to handle it like an adult.
If anything were to go wrong, *anything*, I reckon I'd throw my toys and go sit in the corner to sulk.
But to stay here another night?
The thought of spending any more time here than absolutely necessary seems offensive to me.
To go or not to go. That is the question.
For now, all I have to do is go through the motions...
---
On the walk into the village the thought of food is making me nauseous.
I just *really* don't want to eat.
It's odd. Fair enough to be not hungry, but nauseous?
It makes me wonder if something's wrong with me.
I think I'm just really, really, *really* tired. It's nothing...
My musing walk is interrupted by something stabbing me right through the bottom of my toe like a shard of glass.
I hop around, let vent to a few *days* worth of pent up swearing. All the words. All the *best* ones. It comes out in a torrent.
Well?? "*What the fuck* was that??"
I gingerly pull my foot up where I can see it...
"Son-of-a *bitch*!!"
It’s a thorn, big bastard, the size of toothpick and as sharp as an ice pick. It’s gone clean through my thongs and *right into* my toe.
Yuck!
"Can I catch a fucking break??"
How the fuck does this even happen? Why are there spikes just randomly on the ground waiting for me to put my foot through it?
Fuck’s *sake*.
If my foot hadn’t of reflexively jerked itself in the air before my brain even knew what was going on it would have gone clean through my toe; the thing is needle sharp and metal hard. In one end and out the other. Nothing surer.
Lucky, again.
I think...
There's been too much "lucky" that's actually really fucking unlucky lately. I’m getting fucking sick of it.
My leg is probably going to fall off now; because of course it is; it's the Congo.
If I wasn’t convinced of buying something for those furious burst blisters on my feet I’m sure as shit convinced now.
Get me some alcohol...
---
Fuck riding today.
Fuck it.
Fuck. It.
After breakfast of an omelette I've killed the rest of the morning sleeping on a grubby couch at the "hotel".
I go eat another omelette for lunch.
I'm going to get scurvy.
Post-lunch I head back to the hotel with the resolve to do a little work on the bike, just to do something, *anything*, productive so that my day's not a complete wipe.
First item on the agenda - the air box.
I pop open the bike’s little built in "toolbox", where all the tools are kept, of course, and it dribbles out a weak little vomit of brown water.
I take out the tools and then unlock the lid of the metal box that protects the air box itself. Like a babushka doll. Only not.
Water comes dripping out.
A fair bit of water, actually...
*Fuck.* That's *definitely* not supposed to happen.
We're still ok; so long as the *inside* of the air box is dry we're ok...
Off comes the ice-cream tub air box on the engine side of the air filter.
"Oh... *FARK!!*"
It's got droplets of mud sprayed *all over* the inside, and what looks like baby diarrhoea pooled up in the bottom corner.
It's supposed to be *spotless*!
Off comes the air filter, quickly, aaaand, oh shit. Horrorshow.
It's absolutely *caked* in mud.
Half an inch thick *all over*.
*I had no idea...*
How did The Shrike even *start*? How did it move?? How did I not notice??
How the fuck did it not die?? 
Incredible.
Unbe-fucking-levable.
Shit - the electrics...
I hop around to the other side of the bike and pop open the electrics box.
It's *swimming*.
The water level’s stopped *just* under the fuses. Another centimetre and the electrics would have fried.
How did none of this get splashed yesterday with all the bouncing around?? Beats the shit out of me.
I leave all the compartments open to dry out and wash up the air box and filter with the river water. There's also dried mud through the front disk brake’s “cooling holes”, so I punch those out.
I try to get the baked mud out of all the exhausts nooks and crannies, and fail.
I oil the chain; it's muddy and rusty and isn’t one bit happy about it.
All the manual work has put the jam right back into my doughnut.
I’m feeling alive again.
Chompin at the bit to get on the bike and hit the road.
The appetite’s back, with a vengeance.
Let me at it. Let me at all of it!
---
Morning.
I want to stay...
Can you believe that? What the fuck is that? What a mad roller coaster. I can’t explain it.
But I *really* want to stay here now.
This place is the pits. The worst. I should leave. Plus, there’s no reason *not* to leave today.
I've river water bucket showered and hoovered yet another omelette; five down in thirty six hours. The Shrike is all back in one piece.
There's nothing else for it... gotta go.
---
Dolisie.
Rock bottom expectations are the best expectations to have; they're so very often succeeded.
The road was far, *far* better than the dire predictions and my imagination had dreamt up.
Rather than call the road difficult I would instead call it "irritating".
Less mud, more rocks. More potholes, more corrugations.
It wasn't difficult, just slow and uncomfortable.
There were some small villages on the road but with big, long distances between them. There was hardly anyone using the road at all.
Not exactly confidence inspiring...
The people aren’t particularly friendly anyway...
Coming from Gabon, where there was hardly a single shout from the side of the road - just big smiles and waving hands - to here, where it's less waves and more running, shouting, and making the international sign for “money” while they do.
Even the kids.
It feels tacky.
After lunch the whole thing opened up into a beautiful, stunning, deep-red dirt road.
The depth and vividness of the red was magnificent. Like I’m riding a road of paprika.
It was hands down the best quality red dirt that I’ve had on the trip. Especially after the shit that had been before it, it felt like paradise.
I smashed it at tarmac speed, spraying a rooster tail of paprika dust in my wake.
It was nice to feel the wind on the face again...
The surrounds looked like something out of Super-Mario: really weird green hills in the shape of upside-down cones, lots of them, just popping up out of nowhere.
After six hours - and not eight - I rolled onto tarmac.
The rest of the ride to Dolisie was a cakewalk.
At the crossroads to Dolisie it's ‘mac in all directions off to the vanishing point.
Fucking thrilled with that, because those are the roads I'll have to take when I leave Dolisie again.
At Dolisie I chance my arm at a local ATM and get a wad of cash back.
Everything’s coming up Milhouse.
And it’s about fucking time.
---
I kill a weekend.
It’s a dead town.
The hours are long.
I catch myself doing soul destroying internet trawling for *hours* after I’ve already finished what I went to the "cyber" to get done. When not doing that, I’m either sleeping or lying in my hotel bed doing nothing.
I'm waiting for Monday, because there's an Angolan Consulate on the outskirts of the village. I *have to* have a crack at it; it's only one country away...
---
Monday finally rolls around.
I’m armed to the teeth with papers.
I’ve even taken the liberty of pre-forging a “letter of invitation” and even a “permission letter” from the British Embassy in the capital, which apparently I'll need.
I’ve just typed up both letters - complete with official logos pinched off the interwebs - and printed them out. They actually look pretty legit.
I have to admit, impersonating an Embassy official feels very dodgy. Like, "I could get in real trouble for it" kind of dodgy.
I head to the Consulate.
I shake the hand of the security guard out front - who’s a friendly enough bloke.
He tells me to come back at three o’clock this afternoon...
"Por-qwar?". (Back to Portuguese for the Angolans)
Then he waves another bloke over, who I'm guessing works here, and he said to come back *tomorrow*.
Today’s no good.
In amongst the French I didn’t catch I pick up one word: "Fete."
I’m gonna guess that means it’s a public holiday today...
I take a long walk back to the hotel room.
More boring soul destroying?
Ok.
That’s the afternoon.
I skip dinner; I just don’t feel like it.
---
Well, skipping dinner was a hell of a premonition.
My early detection is *on point*.
Trying to get some shuteye and I’m as bloated as a Biafran and cramping up in the guts.
Badly.
Great. This again.
I’m nauseous and crook as a dog, but my body’s got no *ammo* to work with.
Nothing to fire out the ends.
Feeling crook isn’t even the worst of it.
Not even close.
That honour goes to the delirious, sweating, one foot in a dream and the other foot out of it that goes on for the entire night.
I can’t rest.
Can’t find peace.
The dreams are a mix of confused, unpleasant delirium. I hate it. I *fucking hate* it.
For reasons I don’t understand I’m always rolling onto my back and putting my arms above my head. It's not comfortable - and certainly not a position that I've ever fallen asleep from - but it's just what happens on instinct.
Time draws out.
I just want to rest.
---
I wake up feeling like ratshit.
I'm half out of my mind.
My brain jumps into the worst case scenario: Malaria.
It's not hard to believe - because I can't put my finger on another possible cause.
I’m not sure I can do the Consulate today - I feel like a zombie. Totally and crushingly exhausted, sapped of all energy.
But nailing this visa is too important. *Crucial*, in fact - without it I’m going to have to either ship out or fly out of Congo. I won't be able to go on.
So I can’t put it off any more.
I go through the motions and my demented brain throws up the word "passavant". I check my papers and, sure enough, the passavant for the Shrike runs out today. I'm glad that my sub-conscious is keeping a tab on this stuff, because I'm not...
I skip another breakfast - I'd rather be a zombie than nauseous.
Consulate first.
There's a rigmarole just to get into building, with two security guards both taking down all my details, and one of them even giving me a *metal detector*.
It's over the top.
I also have to leave my bag with the security guard.
Annoying.
I find the secretariat and her crony, introduce myself and explain that I'd like a transit visa. They speak French and a bit of English, so there's no problems understanding one another.
The Sec asks me where I’m from, I tell her England - a half truth.
She tells me to go and get the visa in England.
Fucking great. That old chestnut.
I laugh a nice, good natured laugh even though all I want to do is lie down flat somewhere and cry.
I explain my "mission" and the big trip and how going back to “old Blighty” for a visa isn’t really an option right now...
She considers all this with a bit too much scepticism, but asks to see my passport and a “letter of invitation” anyway.
Back on track.
I go back to my bag outside and fetch my bogus hotel booking and that forged letter from the British Consulate. For good measure I bring along my “letter of motivation/letter requesting a visa”, which is sometimes helpful. I’ve translated it into Portuguese, which I thought was a nice touch...
Cross your fingers.
She looks through all this crap and makes the observation that I'm going via the DRC.
I confirm it.
She fobs me off. Says that I can't get the visa here and I would have to get it in some place called Matadi, because the "system has changed".
Fuck.
Sounds like BS to me.
Time to scramble...
I tell her that the DRC is far too *dangerous*. It’s *unsafe*. So it’s a much better idea to get it here, where it's safe.
It falls on deaf ears. She says that I'll have to go to the Embassy in Brazzaville and plead my case there.
*Shit.*
This isn't going well.
As a last ditch hail Mary I say that I might *actually* go via Cabinda – which is a little, weird enclave of Angola’s on *this* side of the Congo River. Skipping DRC altogether.
I'm getting doughnuts... Can’t be done. Sorry.
I don’t have the energy to argue my case anymore, and my brain’s not crisp enough to be coming up with something clever to turn the tables.
With my brain hamster wheeling on the spot, a woman from another room comes in and has a chat with the woman I've been dealing with.
I catch a *tiny* snippet of it, it’s about *me* – she must’ve overheard from the other room – she’s saying something about Matadi being difficult. I’m straining to understand but it’s all too *quick*.
They finish their chat, and now I'm being asked for passport photos and my immunisation certificate...
Abra-fucking-cadabra! 
I reckon I've jagged it!
I supply everything they ask for, which isn't a whole lot, and get told to come back at one o’clock.
*Hallelujah!*
And, just like that, the final bureaucratic piece of the jigsaw falls into place. After this, there’s no more Embassies or Consulates. *Ever*.
In spite of the crushing exhaustion I could still tap-dance.
This is *huge*.
---
While I wait I head off to the Douanes.
They ask for 10,000 CFA just for an extension. More than twenty bucks... It doesn't cost half that much for an *original* passavant.
I tell them that it's way too expensive.
“Ce un camion?”
Is it a truck?? *What*?? What gave them the impression I'm driving a truck?
“Non... ce un moto...”
The price comes down by half. Weird...
---
I kill a bit of time doing nothing and then head back to the Consulate at one o’clock, sharp.
I get told to go away for another half hour.
I sit on the road out the front for half an hour, then head back in.
I’m told to come back tomorrow morning, at ten o'clock.
The Sec is telling me this while she's playing video games on her computer... Apparently, I’ve got to wait for “the chief” to sign the visa, whoever that is...
No worries. I don't give a fuck. I've got nothing but time.
---
Back at the Consulate with a headache and a guts ache. I've eaten nothing but three bananas in the last 24 hours.
I wish I could eat more, but, in my experience, if you put in a lot you’ll get a lot coming back out. With interest. Food rent.
It’s ten o’clock on the dot.
I get told to come back at one o'clock.
---
At one, I get told to come back tomorrow. At one o'clock.
I’m ready to crack it...
Why is this happening?
No one tells me what's going on.
If they took all my shit yesterday and said “come back in two days” that would have been fine. But the way it's being handled I'm not so sure of the result anymore.
Fuck. I've already chalked this up as a win...
Maybe they're *actually* giving my application a good looking at...
That would *not* be good...
It wouldn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out that there's been a lot of fraud going on. What could they do if they found out?
I hope it’s just that the Consular is too busy faffing about like everyone else here.
I’m torn between tearing them a new one - verbal vitriol - and not wanting to rock the boat...
I steam back to my hotel.
I'm sick of being in here.
---
Day three. One o'clock. Sharp.
I'm not rejected.
But it's the next worst thing; they want to send my application to Luanda - Angola’s capital - for "processing". It's going to take *fifteen* days.
I'm livid, and shattered.
I’m halfway between crying and venting my spleen. My heart slops into the bottom of my guts. I don’t have the energy for either.
Fifteen days kills it; I can’t do that. Firstly, because my Congo and other Congo visas will expire if I stay here for two weeks. Secondly, because even a modicum of scrutiny will reveal that my application is nothing but bullshit.
I tell her that that’s impossible for me, we need to do this now.
I get the equivalent of "too bad".
I beg. I grovel. I plead. I give up my dignity.
They won't budge. Fifteen days.
The secretariat says something to her crony, and they both have a little laugh. Some joke...
It dawns on me that they could have told me this *three days ago*.
I crack it. *Snap*.
They cop an *earful*. I don't even know what I'm saying... Something about incompetence and keeping me rotting in this shitheap of village and more and more and more. I don't know where I'm finding the energy, or the words. It's just rolling off the tongue in French.
I drop mic and walk off.
I'm fucked.
---
Here are my options as I see them.
One. Pull the ripcord. Always an option. Just *leave*. Go home.
Two. Go to this "Matadi" in DRC and cross my fingers. If that doesn’t work out then my options become very, very limited, and none of them are fun: Hell road, or ship out.
Three. Head to a place on the coast called Pointe Noire. Many things can happen there. I can go to the Cabinda border and have a crack there. Or I can go to the Angolan Consulate in Pointe Noire and apply for a visa, there. Or I can maybe ship out because it's on the coast.
Four. Actually wait the fifteen days for the visa. I hate this option. Especially after what’s just happened...
I'm not thrilled with any of this. My emotions are on a bit of a roller coaster ride. I go from being depressed and anxious to the point of *shaking* to being stupidly optimistic about my chances of jagging a visa in Matadi.
A fool’s hope.
What to do? All four options are equally rubbish.
Pick the least worst option and go with it. Whatever that is...
---
Fuck it.
Just get me out of Dolisie.
The Pointe Noire option would have ended in tears; if it didn't go *perfectly* I'd have only two or three days to cover six hundred clicks to get to the border with DRC before my visa expires...
I'm going with option two; Matadi in the DRC.
I know that's stupid. I *know*. But it feels like the least worst option.
It sounds crazy to even say that...

## Chapter Fourty Eight
The shutters open, and as the dreams fade away and the realisation sinks in of where I am - and what that means - it’s greeted with a dollop of dread and anxiety.
Right in the pit of my stomach.
Here it comes again; that little hell. That small terror of detaching from the familiar and going out into the unknown.
Today it’s stronger than usual. *Much stronger*. It makes me want to stay in my hovel, which I hate, and wait for help to come.
I get up and go through the motions like any other day. For lack of a better breakfast alternative I’m stuck with Chocopan and bread again.
Eating’s less like something I want to do and more like a mechanical ramming of the food into my face.
I feel like shit. Nauseated for no reason.
I know that this feeling is irrational - and extremely unconstructive - but instead of taking the time to change my outlook or attitude I just suppress it; it’ll change when I’m on the Shrike, the Shrike always changes everything.
I load up and wheel out. It's the first time The Shrike's seen the light of day in over a week.
The chain is absurdly loose. The word to describe it would be "flappy". By streets this is the loosest that it's been the entire trip.
It's absurd that I had an *entire week* of practically doing nothing to work on the bike, or at least give it a looking at, and I didn't bother.
For the whole week in Dolisie I can’t think of a single moment that I had any motivation to do anything, bike or otherwise.
I ponder fixing it up here and now.
No, fuck that, it'll be alright.
*I'm off.*
The only road that I’ve got on my GPS is the one that I’m going to take. It's a *humongous* detour, but my primary concern is not getting lost. And I've been told that the more direct roads are a crapshoot - a few hundred kilometres of scrubby goat track.
Bugger that.
As part of the detour I'll have to go through the “Pool Region” of the Congo.
I've been told it's *super* dodgy. The "Boko Region" within the Pool Region is even worse, I'll have to go through that too...
It'll no doubt be character building.
Hooray.
But, for now I've got four hundred kilometres of fresh tarmac to ride.
Be happy.
I hit the "N1" and it all rolls off me.
I feel better.
The sky is darkly overcast and looking pretty ominous on the eastern horizon, I'm making a beeline right at it...
There’s always something to stress about, right?
---
The tarmac road ends. It just *finishes*...
There’s a forced detour, it's signed “OLD N1” with an arrow off to the side. It's a shitty, dusty dirt track...
I can't...
---
Six hours.
*Covered* in dust, half blind and all brown. I roll into Loutete.
The tarmac was just a tease. Nothing more.
I spent about half the ride on well graded dirt - the foundations of the "NEW N1" - and the other half on the "OLD N1", which was a fucking *nightmare*.
*So* many trucks.
So narrow.
So much *dust*.
The road’s a goddamn moonscape. The base layer is hard, pointy, solid rock. Punctureville. Floating on top of the base is a thick layer of sediment with the lightness and fineness of talcum powder. I'm not exaggerating.
Big long haul trucks would come flying through at a stonking, breakneck speed and kick up a biblical amount of dust.
And getting stuck behind one... *Fuck.*
Imagine someone throwing gritty talcum powder right in your face - every moment - for six hours...
Shithouse.
Dangerous.
So much for a merry jaunt on the tarmac...
---
In Loutete the Shrike gets a half arsed service. She needs it.
I check the air box and I'm delighted there’s no dust on the inside.
That filter’s doing a bang up job.
All the bolts get tightened.
The chain gets re-tensioned. The links are all very loose and jingle. Can't be long now till that carks it...
I'm in the mood, so I decide to muck around with the clutch play. I jam an allen-key into the clutch pivot where it connects to the engine cover, just to keep it engaged while I remove the cable. The fucker lets go like a crossbow. The allen-key goes flying, lucky not to take out my eye...
Anyway, I replace the nut and grease the actual clutch handle, which has been squeaking. I notice that the cable at the clutch end has worn out a section of its conduit. Then I realise that in Accra I'd put it in all wrong; there's a sleeve that slots into another sleeve to hold the cable straight. This is why the cable wouldn't fit the first time... I fix it and now instead of the clutch motion feeling like shit, all heavy, hard and grungy, it's as smooth and as light as you like. I'm thrilled with the outcome and wish I'd picked up on it sooner. After that the chain gets an oiling and it's job done.
A good afternoons work and it makes me feel really good.
A real morale boost.
---
I’m still on that pendulum. On the roller coaster ride with my eyes shut.
All extremes. No peaceful middle.
I go from feeling like going for a jog to feeling like passing out.
Feeling vulnerable to feeling invincible.
Feeling like crying to grinning like an idiot in bliss.
Feeling rushed to feeling like I’m going too fast.
No stability, no level-headedness.
I know that it's all a choice, how I choose to think. How I choose my attitude.
And yet I just let my emotional state ying and yang where it wants like sheets in the wind.
---
Someone's banging on my door.
*Hard.*
Three times.
It’s dark, I’m naked on my bed, bolt upright.
The initial jolt passes. I'm *shitting* it.
I listen, keenly.
There’s *nothing* that anyone could *possibly* need out of me at this time of the night.
*Nothing*.
They knock again, even louder.
It’s either someone wants me to open the door so that they can do some form of violence to me, or someone wants me to open the door so that I can move my motorcycle or something trivial and stupid.
As far as I'm concerned, both of these people can get fucked.
They bang again...
I’m tempted to get up and give this person a piece of my mind, risky or not...
I hear them walk off.
I lie back down and try to get back to sleep.
Good luck with that...
---
I cog where I am and immediately the dread sets in.
It's becoming the status quo.
And I don't know why; I’ve *no* attachment to this place - I haven’t even been here for a single day yet. So why this feeling? It’s all out of place.
I go through the motions and get out of town.
I'd been told that the road to Mindouli is pretty shit, but that it comes good out the other side.
Here we go...
---
I hit Mindouli.
The "NEW N1" *disappears* completely. Only the "OLD N1" is left.
And it's even *worse* than yesterday, if that's even possible...
The intel couldn’t have been more wrong.
I’m *pissed*.
Furious.
It shits me to tears. This happens *all the time*; people won’t ever tell you that they don't know something if they don't know. Ever. They just can’t ever say “I don’t know”. I've never heard those words. Instead, they'll just take a guess and present it as fact.
This fucking road is a case in point.
You'd think I'd learn my lesson...
---
It gets worse, *again*.
Nothing's flat.
I'm on a constant bounce. All over the place.
Nothing but *constant* attention will suffice. To pick the right track is to bounce, to pick the wrong one is to bottom out the suspension with a *bang*.
If yesterday was like having a fistful of talcum powder thrown in your face every minute, this is like having a snow blower hose you down with the stuff. *Constantly.*
Like someone throwing a bucket of sand in a mulcher pointed at your face while you're trying to keep your eyes open or you might crash and break a fucking leg.
The thickness of the powder seems to have doubled. It's so thick that the tyres are starting to *slide* on it. Like riding on soap, even though it's completely dry. Unbelievable.
It puffs when I walk in it, and when I kick a pile of it it's like kicking air. Like being on the fucking moon!
The traffic's worse. Even *worse.*
Yesterday the majority of the traffic was coming toward me, so you'd get a quick flash of dust and after maybe ten or twenty seconds the slight cross-breeze would shift it off the road.
Today most of the traffic is going *in my direction*. There's no crosswind. Not a breath.
I'm spending half my time trying to pass trucks.
The plumes of dust are biblical, and hey go back forever. There's never any respite; no matter how far back you are from the next truck you're always in it's wake.
Trying to get around trucks is a goddamn *nightmare*. So *flaky*. I have to tailgate a truck while getting pumped full of powder, and then blindly overtake when I'm feeling lucky, squinting through the sepia tinted visor, trying to spot the oncoming truck before it kills you.
It’s terrifying.
At least twice I thought that "this is it"; life, over.
Each time the oncoming truck missed me by a few feet, spraying me with dust out the other end.
Whenever I’m not dicing with death I’m struggling constantly with tyre grip. I'm in a constant state of sliding around on this shit.
When I bury into a deep section of it, or accidentally put The Shrike onto any sort of sideways gradient I can't do much else other than cross my fingers; the tyres will do whatever the hell they want to do.
Over and over and over and over again I’m a fraction away from washing out the tyres and binning the bike. Every time I use the brakes I lock up the tyres and slide.
It’s impossible, tough, white knuckle riding.
After a few hours my throttle hand cramps and locks up from hanging on in a monkey grip.
*And there's still so far left to go...* We're not even close.
---
Somewhere along the line, the trucks thin out, and I’m left on the road all alone.
The talcum powder thins out too.
Instead of dust the air is choc-full of butterflies - more than I’ve seen anywhere on the trip – they’re *everywhere*, and they seem to say “it’s over, well done.”
I wonder if they've been there all along, and I haven't seen them because of the dust...
At this speed it's only little hits once every so often on the helmet.
I open my sepia tinted visor, and see colour again. I feel the wind on my face for the first time in a long time, and suddenly there’s peace.
It’s been a long time coming, and the day's almost over...
---
Something doesn’t *feel* quite right. I can’t put my finger on it...
No, something’s *definitely* up.
I duck my head around to inspect.
The rear tyre is just a little bit deflated...
Shit! *Nightmare!!* No no no fuck fuck fuck!!
Can I make it to Kinkala, the next stop? It’s *so* close. Only thirty clicks away.
If I make it there I can get help...
Damnit! Of course not, ya dickhead. You can't ride on a flat tyre for thirty clicks!
Shit!
So here it is, then, one of my nightmare scenarios that I mentally derange myself with while on the road (the puncture of the rear tyre and having a chain explosion are my current favourites).
I pull over.
*Here we go.*
I whip off all my hot riding gear; my first concern is sweating out; I've got no water left...
Second concern is the fact I've skipped lunch. Again. A poor choice.
My third concern is the actual tyre...
I'm full of nervous adrenaline. I can’t stay calm.
I inspect the tyre.
Sure enough there's a dirty great big flathead nail right in the middle of it.
That's a good start; because at least it's *obvious*. It'd be worse if I couldn't find the cause and just end up with the same problem a little further down the road. That'd be a disaster.
It's also good because it's not my fault; a more skilful rider couldn't have avoided it.
The sun's already got me sweating, it's mixing with the brown dust in my shirt to make mud.
I look around for shade.
Shade on the road here is *extremely* rare, yet there's a small patch in a ditch on the other side of the road where a small embankment has cast a tiny slither of shade.
It’s enough.
I roll the bike over with the rear tyre wallowing about and complaining.
I park it up in the ditch and get to work.
Step one, remove nail.
I can't get at it...
I haven’t even started yet and I can’t even do that; the nail’s all the way in and flush with the tyre. My pliers can't get a purchase on the bastard. They keep slipping off the head of the nail. Doesn’t matter where I try to grab it from, or how hard I squeeze, I can’t keep a hold of it, and the pliers slip and snap shut again and again and again.
It’s like a giant splinter, and the pliers are the tweezers. Like one of those hateful splinters you’ve got to go dig for, and end up butchering your skin to get to...
I use one finger to put downward pressure on the head of the pliers so that the bloody thing won't slip off, and squeeze like hell on the plier grips with the other hand.
The pliers slip off the nail and my finger gets crushed.
I *hear* the skin crunch.
"*Son-of-a-fucking-bitch-idiot! Fuck!*"
Moron! *How did I not see that coming?*
The top layer of skin didn’t break, but all the other layers did... The blood’s welling up and swelling into an enormous blood-blister.
I need to change tactics...
Out comes the screwdriver.
I wedge it under the head of the nail and it levers out. Easy. Shoulda done that the first time...
Moving on.
A car’s coming round the corner. I flag it down and ask the driver – via charades – if he’s got an air pump.
Nothing doing.
They point at a scooter coming the other way. I flag him down, and, yep, he’s got a pump.
You ripper.
My saviours as tatty and covered in dust as I am. His name is Albert.
Problem is though, he’s come too soon; there’s *a lot* of work to be done before I need a pump. It's literally the last thing I need to do... I’m conscious of wasting Albert’s time.
I *almost* tell him to keep going, and think better of it at the last moment. One scooter with a pump doesn't make a trend...
Ok. Here we go. I’ve never done this before... Cross your fingers...
First, I have to unscrew the rear brake pivot just so that I can get at the axle wheel nuts with the spanner.
It’s a pain in the arse.
The wheel and the exhaust get in the way of the spanner, so I can only give the nut a quarter turn at a time, there are a million turns to get through; the thread is as long as a pen.
I *know* the exhaust is molten hot, but I sizzle my forearm on it anyway. I hardly even notice it. Must be that adrenaline.
The fat, swollen blood blister on my finger explodes.
Lovely.
A small forever later and that simple job’s done.
Now, the wheelnut. I take off the "castle nut" using the special tool that came with the bike. It's just a glorified lock nut. The other wheel nut, the big one, requires the fat spanner, and that comes off too.
It’s then that I realise that, through some mechanical witchcraft, I didn't have to take off the big wheel nut... the axle would have slid right out with it still attached to the bike. Somehow... So that means that I didn’t have to take off that piece of shit brake pivot nut...
Albert must think I’m a retard.
What’s worse, with the big nut gone, all that’s holding the whole lot on now is the chain tension on the sprocket (the sprocket is the same thing on a bicycle; that spikey circle of metal that the chain goes on...).
Anyway. The whole thing could just fall apart.
Pretty thick by me. Not smart. Must be the adrenaline again... So many rookie errors.
Out slides the axle and out comes the whole wheel and tyre.
Albert comes alive.
I haven't asked him to, but I think that he's cogged I've got no idea what I'm doing, so he's put himself in the driving seat.
He can have it.
Albert chucks the wheel on the ground and stands on the tyre, doing a weird little crab walk around the perimeter. I don't know what this does exactly, but without exception, *everyone* I've seen change a tyre does this.
Go figure.
With Albert standing on the tyre we both start levering the tyre off the other end of the wheel rim with my pissy little tyre irons.
It starts out in a rush, making excellent, easy progress.
After levering off about a quarter of the tyre out of the rim it suddenly gets tight. The irons are bending under the strain. The metal sticks deform so easily, it’s impossible to get any leverage into the rubber without either ripping a strip out of it or warping the irons.
After a few minutes they wouldn’t look out of place in a packet of twisties...
Albert goes and grabs my wheel cam adjuster - a flimsy shard of metal - and uses that as a third pseudo tyre iron.
It actually works, but we're still not making much more progress.
I wonder if it's impossible with the tools we have... 
We - and when I say "we" I mean Albert – keep at it.
We try and try but we're at a point where the rubber just won’t come out any more.
It’s requires so much force, and yet it's so finicky.
It just won’t go, no matter what we try...
And then it goes. I've no idea how.
That was the crux, it seems, and the rest of the tyre gives little resistance.
Albert was sensational. He was the opposite of the the two blokes in Guinea who just forced everything; he was the one telling *me* to "du-semall", which means "be careful", I think...
Out comes the buggered tube and in goes the new one.
The two are *very* different. They *should* be the same.
The old one is much fatter than the new one, and the thickness of the rubber is like chalk and cheese. The old one is thick and the Chinese piece of shit replacement is thin like a balloon.
The *tyre* has 4.10 written on the tyre wall, but the replacement tube only has 3.00 written on it.
It’s not the same fatness...
I’ve bought the wrong spec...
*Shit.*
Nothing I can do about it.
All it has to do is last me thirty clicks, that’s all I need.
I feel an overwhelmingly urge to take a shit. In my squat position I very nearly shit my pants.
*Where the fuck did that come from??*
I *really* need to shit. *Right this second*.
It'd be rude to ask Albert to wait a moment while I go evacuate. Right?
So I clench.
And move. Fast.
I start levering the tyre back in place in a frenzy.
The start is easy, I levered in all but a quarter in a few seconds...
It tightens, again...
*Shit*. I don't have *time* for this...
It won't go.
We manhandle it but succeed in doing nothing other than warping the irons and shredding the rubber; the tyre won’t budge.
I'm sweating my ring off. Knackered.
And I’ve hardly done anything...
It goes. Again, I don't know how, but it pops into place. There's no knack...
I seize upon Alfred’s hand pump and go at the tyre with gusto.
It actually pressures up surprisingly quickly...
Pump pump pump pump...
I'm *dying* for a shit.
There’s a loud bang and the sound of leaking air.
I'm *fucked*.
*So* fucked.
Wait... It's *not* the tyre... it's the *pump* that's exploded!
The tyre is still losing air, quickly.
I pounce on the valve and unscrew it as fast as I can to keep as much air in the tyre as possible.
The valve comes off. Silence.
I give the tyre a squeeze.
I reckon there’s still enough to ride on.
Well, there’s going to have to be...
I chuck the wheel back onto the bike, axle in and tighten everything back up again.
Each turn of putting that brake nut back on again I'm *sure* I'm on the verge of making an unholy mess.
I ask Albert what he wants for the pump. He says 5k so I give him 10k. He puts his hands together to pray and gives me a humble bow. I guess he's happy with that deal then...
Between contractions I load up the bike again to fly to an appropriate location to get this thing out of me.
Or maybe I can make it to Kinkala...?
*Whoosh.*
On it comes in a rush.
I skid to an emergency stop and dive behind a shrub in one motion.
*Not a second too soon.*
Just another day in the office...
While I'm doing my thing I reflect: That, really, wasn’t so bad.
The punctured tyre, that is...
Another nightmare scenario put to bed.
Whenever I actually have to do something that scares me I always seem to come out the other side having lost my fear of it.
Punctured tyres, snapping a cable, being crook on a ride, getting stuck in the middle of nowhere, I know I can handle it. Once I know I can handle it, I stop worrying about it.
There's something to be said about taking on your fears...
---
Kinkala.
Pool region...
Small village, not much to do, but I *need* a day off.
It's the junk day that I had to have: repairing tyre tubes, washing clothes. Admin.
Despite being a non-riding-day I’m still filled with dread when I wake up. I can’t place it. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense why it’s there; there’s nothing to be scared of today...
It seems to wash off me as I take a bucket shower.
Talking to my host, he reckons that here all the way to Matadi is a total cakewalk. Lots of tarmac with a little bit of offroading in between. It’s too good to be true; which probably means it isn't. Once bitten twice cautious.
Much later in the day I realise that this is my three hundred and sixty fifth day abroad.
One year.
Probably the longest year of my life. Shit, getting on the plane feels like a whole different *lifetime*...
It doesn’t feel like an achievement, a year. Pretty arbitrary, really, and less of a milestone and more of a mental flag that it’s time to refresh the travel insurance, time to forge a new insurance certificate for the bike, and time to ask just what the heck happens in the UK after your motorcycle rego expires.
*Thrilling.*
What’s more interesting is dinner. They give me a questionable fish and rice in a convenient plastic shopping bag. They just slop it into the bottom of the bag... Take away: African style.

## Chapter Fourty Nine
Fade in. And I cog.
Border day. Boko day. Democratic Republic of Congo day.
Unknown. Unknown. Unknown.
And there’s no dread. No nerves. No hesitation. No fear.
It’s *weird*.
I feel *nothing*.
I just get up and get on with it.
I don’t think I’ve *ever* been this relaxed for a border day.
I can't figure it out.
Just like the dread of yesterday’s junk day, I can’t place the calm. It’s totally out of place, especially for a border as gnarly as this one. It's *Zaire* for fuck's sake.
Anyway. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth and all that...
I pack up and shape up and get going.
Kinkala’s not big enough to have any *legitimate* petrol, so I head to the bloke on the side of the road who’s selling jars of the stuff.
Grubby jars into a grubby funnel.
He's spilling fuel *everywhere*. All down my tank. Don't know what happens if it drips onto the engine...
I put in three bottle’s worth. However much that is...
The second bottle is full of shit and sediment at the bottom. Petrol shouldn’t have *chunky* stuff in it, I’m pretty sure...
I hit the road. And road it is. The intel was solid.
Tarmac all the way.
Wonderful.
It’s a one-and-a-bit lane road that twists and bobs its way through the gentle washed-out-green hills.
Very picturesque. No dust. No trucks. Just me and the Shrike.
I could get used to this...
We chomp the mileage.
It's delightfully easy and uninvolved. Chilled. I love it. I've missed it.
It's the first day of the entire trip that I've packed my wet weather gear way down the bottom of the bag.
So of course it rains...
Figures.
Luckily it doesn’t get too bad, but it's another lesson learned: don’t pre-empt *anything* here.
---
Boko.
It's a nothing village.
I have a little scratch around for an Immigration post; I have the feeling that this was going to be one of those posts that are nowhere near the border itself; still fifty clicks to go till I cross the line.
I don’t look too hard. Which is probably pretty thick, really.
I don't even ask anyone.
I ride on.
And *just* outside of Boko the tarmac disappears.
Vanishes.
Replaced by a very, *very* bad, hard rock path.
It's not a path of rocks, it's a path of *rock*. As in stone.
Singular.
The flat bits aren’t all that bad, but anything on a slant has had the rainwater gut fat channels out of the rock, leaving deep, eroded tranches all over the road.
We’re in the hills. Good luck finding something flat...
Even in a beast of a 4x4 this would be impassable.
I reckon I can do it on two wheels.
We grind our way on, bouncing all over the "road" in first gear, suspension moving like a jack in a box. It doesn't take long to realise that there's going to be nothing out here.
Not a damned thing.
This road couldn’t service the *smallest* of villages.
No chance.
---
I nearly bin it, over and over and over again.
In the space of hours I've seen two people on the path. *Two.*
They’re walking around with stuff on their head, as they will, but I’ll be buggered if I know where they’re coming from, or where they’re going.
The track has become so overgrown, crappy and remote that I’ve got to check my GPS to make sure that I haven’t somehow taken the wrong path.
Nope, this is the one.
I’m constantly worried that around the next corner the road is just going to say “nooooooope, sorry, you can’t keep going, impossible”, just like it did back in the mud.
Like a cliff or something.
---
Not far from the border and the track merges into a wide, beautifully graded dirt road.
*"Where the fuck did that come from??"*
The pleasantest of surprises.
These tracks are hands down my favourite to ride.
I *fly*.
Kicking up a huge plume of dust in my wake like a rocket ship.
It’s *glorious*. And the rolling gentle green hills make a gorgeous backdrop to the ride.
In a twinkling I'm at the Congo border post.
Time flies when you’re having fun...
I’m stoked to see them in their little tin shack.
I give them my passport, and it’s the easiest checkout of my life; they go fetch the stamp, asked if I have a photocopy of my passport, which I say I don’t (but I do), they say no worries, thwack some ink on my passport, have a nice day!
Not a *single* detail was written down, just all smiles and laughs and “who gives a fuck”.
Excellent. I wish more were like it.
I ask my new buddies about the condition of the road to the next village in DRC: Luozi. The answers is "bad". They reckon it will take four hours to get there.
They better not be underestimating that...
I peel out.
The good road disappears just as fast as it came.
Bummer...
I cross the “border” line - because my GPS says so.
There’s zero fanfare of any sort. No border post. Nothing.
I crack on.
---
The road is arguably worse than before.
It’s rough as guts.
I'm back to involuntary swearing in my helmet and wrestling with the Shrike for control as we bounce all over the place and try to avoid flipping off the edges into the trenches.
If I bin it in a trench it'll be - at best - a long walk to get help, probably with a broken bike. More likely will be a broken bike and a broken leg.
I'm not sure how that would end...
If I fuck something up out here I'm going to be waiting a long, *long* time for someone to walk by.
I haven’t seen a single other vehicle since all the way back in Boko. Not one.
---
After who knows how long of riding I finally come to my first village; a scattering of mud huts.
I ask around and, surprisingly, one of them is the DRC Immigration post. Excellent.
There are two blokes in plain clothes and another bloke who’s sitting outside, oblivious to any comings and goings. I think he’s locked onto the Shrike. It might be love.
It’s handshakes and smiles all round. I duck into the hut and we get to it.
They look at my passport and straightaway one of the blokes gets on the phone. I try to follow the French as best I can. The words "Britannique" and "Togo" pop up. He’s asking someone about my visa. He doesn't seem thrilled...
My guess is that they don't like that I've got the visa in Togo, because I'm not from Togo...
And it shits me. I applied for a visa, and I got one. These border mugs shouldn’t have *anything* to do with it; they shouldn’t have to re-validate and interrogate all the details that have already been checked at the Embassy.
I don’t need any of this.
He gets off the blower.
Sure enough he's saying something to me in French that includes the words “resident and Britainnique”. The words and body language are telling me the visa is no good.
Right. Buckle your seatbelts. This could get rough.
I explain that I'm a British citizen but a *Togo resident*. I *live in* Togo.
I get a look from both of them that says "Pah-leeze mate, don't bullshit a bullshitter".
He smugly asks for my Togo residency permit.
I'm ready for it. I pull my Togo residency permit out of my jacket pocket, unfold it, and hand it to him with a smug smile.
Stick *that* up your arse.
The two of them look at the permit, share a look, and then back at the permit, then at me.
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
Check. Mate.
They scrutinise the permit again, but all the details check out.
While they’re figuring out that curve ball, I improvise a story to try to make it all fit together, and I sell it with gusto: I’m an engineer working for an oil company in Lome, *where I live*. For this trip, I quit my job, flew to England, where I’m a citizen, and then did the whole trip - everything that you see in the passport - and *then* picked up the visa for DRC on the way through, *in my hometown* of Lome, Togo.
Not likely, and not particularly strong, but there’s no way to tell that it’s *not* true. At least not all the way out here in bumfuck nowhere.
They’re not swallowing it...
They’re more interested in the date that I picked up the residency permit: just two days before the visa was issued...
Well done, Sherlock.
Scramble time.
I explain that I never *needed* a residency permit while I lived in Togo. Why would I? The only time that I needed a residency permit for anything was when I tried to get the DRC visa at the embassy and they asked for one, so I got one. Right?
They’re not thrilled with this.
The bloke gets back on the blower again. I try to follow, but I'm not catching any of it.
He hangs up the phone and explains to me that that was the “chef”, which is French for "the boss", and that his chef needs to call *his* chef to get the green light.
Christ, how long’s *that* going to take??
---
We listen to the mice squeaking in the corners of the mud hut for an hour or so.
Now that I notice it, there’s mouse shit *everywhere*.
Lovely...
I’m starting to run low on patience.
In the purgatory we’ve talked mostly about the soccer. I’ve close to no interest in soccer, but I’m interested in it because every man, woman and child in Africa is interested in it; it's the best water cooler fodder I've got.
I slip into the conversation my plans for the future: Angola, Namibia, South Africa and then, of course, I'm going to ship everything back home to Togo.
I'm not sure if it's cementing my bullshit story, but it can't hurt.
I *need* to make this work now, even if it means taking a risk I wouldn't normally take: I ask them what more do they want from me, what more can I give them? How can I help move this along?
A thinly veiled offering of a bribe.
They take the bait; the bloke without the phone says kind of half-heartedly that I can give them 10 dollars for filling out details in their book.
I pounce on it and re-direct it. If I pay now I get the passport stamp now? Yes?
"Non."
Bummer.
Back to the wait.
---
The day is getting on...
What happens if this takes the *whole* of the day.
And what if I’m unceremoniously rejected? Then what?
I’ve no fucking clue. It’s never happened before.
I guess these guys aren’t above taking a bribe, so I guess it’s more of a question of how much it’s going cost me, if anything...
I hope...
While I’m checking the time and doing the math for how much longer they can keep me here at the post before I’m in the shit, the phone rings.
I strain to cog the conversation, or at least get the flavour...
*It’s a green light.*
Fucking ripper. The artful dodger strikes again!
Despite having done nothing to help me out the guys ask for that ten bucks anyway to stamp the passport. Sorry lads, that ship has sailed.
Unlucky!
I make up another story about how I don’t have any money, not a cent, and I ask where abouts I can find the closest bank to get some cash.
I'm so full of shit.
They stamp me out.
Hello, Democratic Republic of Congo.

## Chapter Fifty
Twenty clicks to Luozi and I go mad.
*Euphoric*.
Off my face.
Twenty clicks out. That means that whatever happens now I know that I can jog it in.
Might not be the most pleasant run, sure, but I know I can get it done without water or food.
I know I’ve made it.
I'm singing in my helmet like a madman as we bounce around the road, which has started to flatten out a bit, the rock's gone to light sand, and in small sections it’s glorious and quick.
And the urge to cry comes flooding out of nowhere.
I’m singing at the top of my lungs.
Screaming it!
This is what it's all about. I love this!
Why the hell do I want to go home after South Africa? Going home seems *insane* now. Why would I even *think* that? This feels *amazing*!! I could do this forever!! I’m going to do this forever.
Bring on South America!
---
Ten minutes of the divine vision and I bonk out.
Exhausted.
Tired. Hungry. Sore.
I take the risk without even really thinking about it and open the throttle a little and chance my arm, moving a lot quicker than I have a right to.
I’m still bouncing off everything, but it’s just a lot faster now. But it’s working out alright.
I *ying* when I should have *yanged* and go flying out of control into a hedge.
I get good and scratched up before I get things under control again and haul The Shrike back onto the road, wide eyed and paying fresh attention.
---
I pull into Luozi.
It’s a fair bit less than I was expecting.
Big enough to have proper buildings and some official looking stuff, but too small by a long way to have things like banks, a range of accommodation, or a good road coming out the other end of it...
After a fair bit of asking around and playing Marco Polo with the locals I find somewhere to stay.
It’s Spartan as fuck.
The room has nothing within the bare mud walls other than what looks like an army hospital bed from world war one, and a small writing desk.
It’ll do. And for six bucks, it’s really hard to complain.
I’m just happy to have somewhere to stay.
I really can’t be bothered doing anything, but my desire to be out of this room for as long as possible is stronger than my exhaustion. So I drag my arse out to go get shit done.
No one wants to trade money with me, so I get put over the barrel on the price.
Forty bucks worth of cash here in the local "Congolese Franc" is almost too much cash to hold in one hand. I feel like I'm in a burger commercial.
Forty bucks must be a king’s ransom here or something...
The notes are *filthy*.
I head to the Douanes.
One of their plebs asks for fifty bucks worth of francs to issue me a laissez-passer.
I tell him that it ain’t gonna happen and that the most I’ll pay is five bucks.
He gets on the blower to the chef, and then hands the phone to me.
*What the fuck does he think I'm going to do with this??*
I put the phone to my ear and say “allo?” and someone on the other end blasts two minutes of continuous vitriol into my ear.
I’ve no idea what he’s saying – it’s not even a conversation; all I can cog is that he well pissed off.
I think I’ve offended them somehow...
I hand the phone back while he's still yelling.
With nothing cleared up, and obviously making no headway on my five dollar offer, I just walk out.
---
Back to the Shrike.
I’ve been hanging on to a spare speedo cable for the one that I snapped way back in The Gambia.
Ever since it snapped I’ve had no idea what speed I’m going at, or how much distance I’ve covered. I just ride as fast as feels right, and take a break when I feel like it.
Honestly, I haven't missed it.
But, my GPS is telling me that I’ve done roughly ten thousand clicks between here and The Gambia. So now seems to be as obvious a point to replace it as any.
The light’s fading but I reckon I can still get it done.
It’s a pretty simple thing, a speedo cable, it’s like a long, thin spring that’s been wound up super tight. About the length of your arm. It’s bendy and flexible, so you can manoeuvre one end into what’s called an “assy”, or something like that, down by front wheel’s axle. The other end goes into a hole under the speedo, in behind the bike’s headlight.
I’m sitting on the dirt of the hotel’s courtyard, fucking with the cable.
It’s not fitting properly.
Doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t get both ends in.
It’s starting to give me the willies.
It’s tight quarters in the very busy headlamp space, full of shit and wires and cables and plugs. There’s no room for fingers. It's very fiddly. Fiddly when you need to be forceful makes for a maddening pain in the arse.
This was supposed to be an *easy* job.
Six lads step into the courtyard and come over to me. They start asking me inane questions.
I’m usually cool with this sort of thing, but right now I know I’m not handling this well.
I’m racking my brains to figure out what’s going on with this cable, the sun’s setting, I’m running out of time, I’m *frustrated*, tired - exhausted, even - and these blokes won't stop with their questions.
Like answering the questions of six irritating kids.
I'm trying to give the subtle hint that I'm a bit busy right now, and I'm happy for you guys to watch, but just let me work in peace. *Please*.
Nope. They’re not picking up what I’m putting down.
They go on and on and on. After half an hour I still haven't got this fucking cable in and they won't stop fucking pestering me; *I can’t deal*. But I think I've just figured out what's up: I need to rotate that “assy” around on the front axle to give myself a tiny bit more space, which is a bit more involved than it sounds, because the assy is locked in with the wheel’s axle nut, and that ain’t going anywhere...
Now the six are saying my last name. They’re *fascinated* with it. The way their saying it is giving me the shits.
A chorus of guys butchering my name, saying it over and over and over and over and...
I crack.
Snap.
I blow my top.
I lecture them like children.
The guys take huge big fistfuls of offence, and I feel awful straightaway.
Without another word they just walk off and leave, with me apologising profusely as they go.
Five minutes later the job’s finished.
I feel like an arsehole.
I head back to my hovel hospital bed. Things quickly go dark, and then something shits on my head...
That's karma for you.
---
Not much to do today.
I'm not sure if I could handle anything but a short day.
About a hundred clicks of dirt road out to the main highway and then another hundred clicks of tarmac to Matadi.
Come to think of it, this is going to be my last day of dirt for the rest of the trip. After today, it should be ‘mac all the way to Cape Town.
It makes me sad.
Like the end of an era.
I miss it already. I’m going to soak it up for all it’s worth today. Make the most of it. Savour every moment.
I head into the village to change money. On the way in, a guy comes up to me on the street to shake my hand, and then he just stands there, still, holding my hand.
I’ve let go of the shake, my hand's limp, but he won’t let go of my hand.
He looks a little crazy.
I walk off, thinking he’ll let go, but he doesn’t, so I’m dragging this crackpot along behind me.
After quite enough of that I forcefully shake my hand hard enough to get it back and walk on.
He won’t leave me alone.
I hate people like this. Hate them.
He follows me around ranting shit about who knows what to god knows who.
He follows me through the *whole fucking village*.
I try to shake him off, moving quickly through the narrow and busy markets, but I can’t lose the tail.
I’m not about to change money with this bloke following me around like a bad smell. I tell him - mostly with body language and with some broken yet forceful French - to fuck off, but he seems oblivious to it all. I don’t want to be any more forceful because I’m worried it’ll rub some people in the village the wrong way if it looks like I'm verbally lashing this bloke, and that’s the last thing that I want.
Bugger this.
I head back to the hotel.
He follows me all the way back to the goddamn courtyard. He must’ve tailed me for a good half hour at least. I feel like I’m being chased, harassed, friggin stalked. Feels bloody awful.
I tell him to wait (“attanday”) at the entrance to the open hotel courtyard and, thank god, he obeys, and I just leave him there.
As I go into my room I quickly turn my head to the entrance. He's still there.
---
I've been twiddling my thumbs for half an hour in my room.
I poke my head out of the door to see if he’s run out of patience.
He’s gone.
I head back into the village in the most roundabout and stealthy way I can imagine, and manage to get my money changed free of hassle.
Hoo-ray.
I change two hundred bucks worth.
If forty was enough to be a lot, then two hundred is enough to not look out of place in a gangsters briefcase.
It’s a shit-tonne o’ money.
Heading back to the hotel with my treasure trove, Mr I'm-Fucking-Crazy spots me and comes running over and gets right in my face.
Nup. None of this shit. Fuck that. My patience is out. Bugger rubbing people the wrong way.
I switch to English and tell him with forehead vein popping intensity that if he doesn’t fuck off I’m going to cave his fucking head in.
Does the job.
Some things just transcend language...
---
While I’m gearing up to get going some guy comes walking into my hotel room. He introduces himself as the 'Chef de Immigration'.
Ever heard of knocking, mate?
He’s wearing the African equivalent of a Hawaiian shirt and a silly Scottish golfers hat. Hardly threatening.
He wants me to stop by at Immigration to photocopy my passport and visa and residency permit on the way out.
Bugger that.
Why would I?
What’s in it for me? All that I’ve got to gain is a headache.
But then, if they catch me out while I’m trying to do a runner I might be in the shit.
And what if they tell someone down the line to keep an eye out for me when they realise I've skipped town. I don’t exactly blend in...
Alright, stuff it, I’ll go.
---
On the way to Immigration I grab four stodgy bottles worth of fuel. The bloke pours it through *a food strainer* and into my tank.
Righto...
The Immigration office is dimly lit, and the bloke manning it is a different guy. I sit down and we get to it.
I give him my papers, and I cop the *exact* same rigmarole from him that I copped from the blokes at the border.
*The visa is no good*.
We’ve been through this. I don’t need this again...
The two of us make the same circular arguments over and over and over again...
---
Somewhere in the vicinity of an hour has passed.
He's getting shitty.
He's not the only one...
The aggressive wanker starts filling out some sort of form that I never asked for, and then says "give me money".
*Fucking great...*
He tells me the form costs twenty dollars to fill in. I want to tell him to go fuck himself. Instead, I tell him I have no money.
It's a great card to play. What are they going to do? Deport me?
I pull a shitty 1000 CDF note out of my pocket – about a dollar’s worth - and tell him that this is *all the money that I have* until I can find a bank, knowing full well and good that there isn’t a bank in the village.
This is *all I have* for my lunch today.
This is bullshit. I mentally count my cash: I’ve got a fat wad of CDF’s in my other jean pocket, a king’s ransom in my inside jacket pocket, more money in my saddlebags outside, and [about seven hundred] U.S. dollars in my secret jacket pocket. I’m rollin’ deep.
He keeps me around for a long time talking to "the chef" on the phone.
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that there’s no one on the other end of the line, that he’s just having a conversation with himself...
I don’t think that he knows that *I* know the chef...
When he's off the phone I tell him to get the chef in the building, and then go ahead and give as precise a description of the chef as I can.
Suddenly, it’s “only a photocopy and no embarrassment”. I can leave.
Is he shitting me?
I’m happy and pissed off and confused all at once.
Whatever.
I jump on the Shrike. It won’t start...
It makes noises like an old car trying to fire, but it won’t turn over.
*What the fuck?*
What’s that supposed to mean?
I give it another go and it boots on the fifth or sixth turn, and blows a big plume of black smoke out its arse.
Sounds crook...
There are misfires everywhere. The Shrike's unhappy, and so am I.
Air filter?
Dunno.
We make it to the other end of the village, and we're stopped by The Congo River.
I thought it was going to be big, but I didn’t think it would be *this* big.
It's *immense.*
The other riverbank is so far away that it’s shrouded out almost completely by the humid fog.
It's as still as a lake...
I sit and take in the view while I wait for the barge to get going.
---
An hour and a half later and it's finally time to start loading up the barge.
It's past lunchtime by the time we get to the other side of the river.
The Shrike won't start. Again.
Eventually it turns over enough and blows black out the back.
It's really not happy.
I can tell that if I roll off the throttle to let it idle it'll conk out.
It's *suffering*.
I roll off the throttle.
The Shrike gives a few coughs and bangs and then dies...
*Yuck.*
Probably that fuel, right? That shitty fuel?
What if it dies on the ride?
It chews my head as I chew a banana.
I hit the ignition again and when it finally fires I don't waste any time. We're off.
I'm not going to take a break for the rest of the day if I can help it; the last thing that I want to do is to turn off the bike in the middle of nowhere only for it to refuse to start again.
So, that’s going to be - minimum - three hours. Probably more.
I’m not sure if I can do it.
That's a *long* time in the saddle. That'd even be a long time to sit on a couch.
It’s really hot and *really* humid.
I’m already sore from the last week and last night’s hospital bed.
I'm already tired.
But what else can I do?
The marathon begins.
The road is practically the same as the one on the north side of the river, if not a little easier. There’s still hardly any people, traffic or villages. Nothing really.
It’s going to be a lonely ride.
---
My arse is already telling me I need a break, and my throat is telling me I could really use a drink. It's only been about an hour. I ignore it.
I'm bouncing up a hill, and I can sense...
What *is* that?..
Something’s not quite right...
Something...
I go cold all over.
I lean my body over and take a look at what’s going on; but I already know.
The back tyre’s got no air in it.
None.
Empty.
It’s rolling and lolling and flapping away noisily.
No. no no no no no no no no no no no no...
I *swoon*.
Oh shit fuck no! Not again! Not *here*...
I pull up, and the Shrike coughs and splutters to death by itself.
Silence.
I’m not sure I can deal with this...
But. Well. I’ve got to. No choices. Get on with it.
I know this should be an easy job.
I know it, alright? It's ok...
It’s just a tube change, it’s not rocket science, no big deal, right?
Well, yeah. But no.
Get started.
The tyre is *hot* to touch. Jerk-your-hand-away hot. *Not* a good sign. Must’ve been riding on it for a long time for it to get that angry.
Hope I haven’t fucked the tyre and the tube... If the tyre's fucked then I'm *definitely* fucked.
*“Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.”*
I look for signs of a puncture culprit, but find none.
No dirty big nail this time.
I take a quick squiz at my GPS.
It looks like I’m almost perfectly stuck in between where I came from and the next village along; fifty kilometres forward, fifty kilometres backwards. And nothing in between.
Figures...
So, it’s up to me then.
Well, no it’s not. If it’s up to just me then I’m a dead man; I need someone with an air pump.
*Shit.*
I do a quick stock-take of supplies. I’ve got a banana that I picked up on the boat, and a bottle of water.
I ain’t gonna be jogging it in. Not *fifty* clicks.
Well, maybe... I *have* done a fifty clicker before. But that sucked. Hard. And was under *much* better conditions. *I* was in much better condition... And it wasn't ripping hot and reeking humid.
So, *no*. Nothing left to do but to cross my fingers and hope that someone eventually comes along. Other than that, I might as well get to work and do what I can.
I wheel the bike around to face downhill so the bike will tip forward on the stand and let me work freely on the rear wheel.
I’m sweating before I’ve even taken my shit off the back.
My clothes are already starting to soak through in the dead air.
The sound of a motor cuts through the silence...
I stop everything and prick my ears up. It's a long way off...
I wait.
Sure enough, a big 4x4 comes rumbling past.
*Bizarre*.
He must’ve been up my arse this whole time, ever since the barge.
The vehicle is packed with humans. I mean *packed*.
Swimming with them. I can’t even do a headcount... Must be pretty fucking uncomfortable in there in this heat and humidity and all the bouncing around...
It’s obvious that the driver’s keen to move on. But I manage to hold him up for long enough to explain that I’ve got a puncture and no pump.
He has a pump.
*Hallelujah*.
He’s not going to stay to help me, he needs to leave now.
Despair. I'm crushed. I don't know if I'll get this chance again... I beg him to stay for just a little bit.
He can't. But he will sell it to me instead for twenty bucks.
Deal. Fucking deal.
That’s a great deal for him and a fucking saviour for me.
Deal, deal, deal!
Merci et au revoir, mon ami!
The noise of the 4by fades, and now it really is all on me.
I can do it.
Out comes the wheel, which is less of rigmarole after learning my lessons a few days ago.
It's not arduous, but the sweat is already dripping off the end of my nose like a leaky tap.
Shit.
I take a drink.
This bottle isn't going to last...
Time for the real work; getting that fucking tyre out of the rim again.
Even with four hands and three irons I wasn’t sure we were going to get it last time.
I don’t like my chances...
But, then, it *has* to work. I have to make it work.
The first three quarters of the tyre come out easily, but just like before it tightens for the last quarter, and won’t move.
No matter what I do it won't lever out. Exactly the same as last time. It’s too tight. The bastard thing is designed to stay in that rim, and that’s exactly what it wants to do.
Anything I lever out just slides right back into the rim again.
It’s so *tricky*!
If I try to go further in to get at a bigger section of the tyre I just end up pulling so hard that I bend the metal. The tyre won’t budge a fucking millimetre.
It’s hard, frustrating work.
Not frustrating; *Infuriating*. That’s what it is. I want to take the wheel and hammerthrow it into the bushes.
There’s no outsmarting this.
I want to give up. But it's not an option.
Sweat is drumming onto the tyre with a steady “doonk, doonk, doonk…” like a metronome.
I’m going to snap.
---
I give up.
I need a break.
I go check my GPS for the time. I've been at it for something close to an hour...
*I can’t do it*.
I feel like I’m just pushing shit uphill. Smashing my head on a wall.
My hands are blistered and filthy.
Half the bottle of water is gone. My throat is tight with thirst. It's biting at the back of my mouth, but I don't dare take a drink.
If another car ever comes by I’m going to get in.
Leave everything.
But what if a car doesn’t come?
When do I start walking?
Nah. It has to work. I’ve *seen* it done.
*It has to work*.
I get back onto the levers.
I’m shredding up the tyre wall now. It doesn’t really matter if I ruin the tyre if I can’t get the tube out anyway. But, then again, there's no point in replacing the tube if I've destroyed the tyre.
Fuck it.
*"Fuck you!!"*
I carve the fucker up.
I carve and carve and it's a mess.
The bastard pops out.
*Thank fucking Christ*.
I sit on the dirt floor and catch my breath and flex my fingers.
I can see the wires or canvas or whatever that is that’s under the rubber on the tyre. *That can’t be good...*
Out comes the shitty busted Chinese tube.
I pump it up and give it a good looking over. But I can’t find the puncture. It should be hissing air at me from *somewhere*.
It must be tiny.
I look and look and look. It’s important. I *have to* find it. If I can find where the puncture is on the tube, that'll give me a ballpark area to look at on the tyre for the cause...
Nothing doing.
*Nothing*. The tube is losing air but I can’t find where. I need water so that I can look for bubbles.
But that ain’t gonna happen. I ain’t even going to spit on it.
Bugger it.
Get on with it.
I tuck my old and re-patched tube into the tyre like tucking in a blanket.
Even this has to be tricky.
The prick of a thing is too fat to fit in between the rubber and the rim.
It won’t slide in easy. I know I shouldn't, but I have to force it.
It goes.
Now, damn it, I’ve got to lever the tyre *back* into the rim.
I step on the tyre, just like Alfred did, and half of it pops neatly into the rim.
Good.
At the three quarters in mark my feet and weight can do no more.
Tyre iron time.
Again, it’s fucking impossible.
Once I reach “the crux” - that last quarter - I just can’t make *any* progress. The tyre refuses to obey, and obstinately bends the crap out of these pissy god damn mother fucker tyre irons.
And it's even more risky than before, because now there’s a thin tube on the inside that if I accidentally catch between the tyre iron and the rim... well, I don’t even want to think about that...
Point being, the job requires a huge amount of force, and I’ve got to, somehow, be delicate at the same time.
Time passes. I work.
---
No progress.
None.
I’m gutted.
Spent.
Covered, saturated, in sweat – sweat that I’m not replacing.
It keeps rolling into my eyes, stinging, and I can't wipe my eyes because of my filthy hands, covered in grease and dirt and blisters.
Thirsty. Tired. Scared.
The blisters on my hands explode.
There’s flappy bits of stinging skin all over my hands, weeping whatever that is that blisters have. The blister fluid collects the red dirt off the ground, and the road grime off the tyres.
The crushed thumb from a few days back has peeled right open.
I’m in trouble.
I can feel myself crapping out.
My brain is slowing. I'm running out of kilojoules.
The tyre pops in.
I don't know how, but it gets past the impossible limit, and the rest of the tyre happily pops in, easy as you like.
We’re done.
I don't have anything left to even be happy.
*Get me out of here.*
I get out the air pump and work away at the plunger.
The tyre inflates quickly, and before long it passes my thumb-squeeze pressure-test.
I unscrew the pump off the valve as fast as I can; air hisses and escapes through the valve while it’s still attached.
The valve comes off.
But, there's still a little noise...
What *is* that??
I stick my ear onto the tyre...
I can hear a tiny, *barely* audible hiss.
Oh no...
*No*...
No no no no no no no no! Oh *fuck no*!
I'm fucked.
*Fucked!*
I’m going to cry.
My grubby face collapses into my grubby, mauled, hands.
All that for nothing.
No more options. No more spares.
Nothing.
Fuck the bike. Fuck my stuff. I’m in trouble here.
I need to get out.
I’ll be lucky to have another car, and even luckier if that’s not swimming with people like the last one...
I’m no chance to bring my shit with me. It will all have to stay here.
Everything I own. Everything. On the side of a road. In the Democratic Republic of Congo. Overnight. Probably.
What chance do I give that?
50/50?
*Worse?*
What to do...
I can’t move the Shrike into the bushes to hide it – it’s missing a wheel... – so I lock the steering, lock my chain on the front wheel. And that's all I can do...
I chuck all my shit deep into the roadside scrub *precisely* twenty strides away from where I've parked the bike.
I mark a waypoint on the GPS, and call it “EVERYTHING”. 
That’s all I can do.
Time to wait.
And pray.
---
How did it come to this...?
*What am I doing here??*
---
That’s a motor!
Is it…?
Yes! *Definitely* a motor. Coming from the direction I was headed in.
I don't know how long I've been waiting...
A 4x4 comes around the corner.
It’s jam fucking packed. It looks even busier than the other one. This one’s even got blokes hanging off the sides and some mad bastard sitting on the top.
The driver stops for me.
He looks like he’s never cracked a smile once in his whole miserable fucking life.
It’s pretty obvious what my problem is; one look at the Shrike tells the whole story. I get straight to business (I'll save you the French...).
Do you have a puncture kit?
Non.
Can I come with you?
Non.
Fuck. I *have to* go with him...
I’m looking down at the ground while I think of what to do next, and I cog that *his* tyre is deflating.
Fast.
*Pissing* air.
Ha! What are the odds?! There’s karma for ya, jerk!
I point it out to him and I’m on the verge of going full, delirious, cackling maniac on him.
I don't think he appreciates my outward happiness at his misfortune, but it’s *hysterical*.
Misery loves company, and now all of you are stuck with me! Suck eggs!
The “hangers on” on the side of the car launch into action.
They switch out the tyre for the spare with the efficiency of a race car pit crew.
This mob have played knifey spoony before...
And they’re gone.
They just drive off.
---
My imagination gets vivid.
All the bad outcomes.
It’s driving me nuts. But there’s nothing left to think about.
I sauté my nerves in a rolling simmer.
It's a slow cook.
Even though I’m not moving. I’m still sweating.
The water's gone...
I *need* to get out of here.
Another sound. Is it..??
Yes!
This one’s big.
Real big.
Gotta be a truck...
It’s a fucking truck!
How is that even *possible* on this road??
Doesn’t matter, it’s *perfect*.
Everything can come with me!
Thank *Christ*.
Perfect perfect perfect!
Deliverance!
I wave him down.
He pull’s alongside me. But he doesn’t stop.
Why isn’t he stopping??
The truck keeps rolling slowly on. I half-trot to keep up.
He's not stopping!!
I’m waving, shouting, pleading, begging, running alongside. But the truck starts making more noise, and slowly pulls away.
"Fucking *mug*!!"
---
I can’t do this anymore. I can feel the snap coming on.
What happens then?
A meltdown in Congo? And after that?
No one knows I’m here. There’s no one who will help me. No one who can save me.
*No one’s going to save you, no one’s going to save you, no one’s going to save you...*
Another sound.
Definitely.
Small. *Whiney*.
A scooter comes around the corner this time.
Useless; it's got three blokes on it...
It’s already violating the laws of physics.
If that wasn’t enough, there are wooden crates stacked up high enough to be a fourth man on the back.
They pull up alongside me, and take the chance to have a break.
I dejectedly explain the situation to the driver while he hoses one out into the scrub.
I’m about to ask him if he could send me some help when he gets to the next village, but he beats me to the punch; he says that he’ll help me.
I can’t see how...
He says he’ll take my wheel to the next village, have it repaired, and then bring it back to me ... for ten dollars...
*I don’t have to do another tube change...*
Deal! Deal deal deal deal!
That’s a deal!!
My friggin *saviour*.
It's weird. I'm mostly thrilled that someone's taking care of the repair for me, rather than being saved.
Weird...
Anyway. My personal Jesus wants the money now, *before* he leaves.
I reckon that’d leave him with very little incentive to do what he said he would do... Something tells me that he’s not doing me this favour out of the goodness of his heart...
The only thing worse than the current situation would be the current situation minus a stolen wheel, minus ten bucks, and in the dark.
I convince him it’s better for both of us if I give him the money once he comes back.
It's a deal.
The two other blokes are trying to strap the wheel to the top of the leaning pile of wood crates with a couple of rubber straps.
They’re struggling.
It slowly dawns on all of us that it’s a bridge too far, it ain’t gonna fly. There’s nowhere else it can go...
Despair.
Just when there was hope, it’s snuffed out again.
I'm sure that this is my last chance. It's too late in the day for more traffic.
I’m about to ask him, again, if he can send me help from the next village, when he pulls a *brand new* tyre tube from out of the bike somewhere, like a goddamn magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
It’s an 18 inch tube, which is *exactly* my size.
*Is this real life??*
Twenty dollars.
I make that fucking deal!
He’s stoked, I’m saved. Everyone’s happy.
Then it dawns on me; I'll have to change the tube... Again.
I look at the tube in my hands, terrified.
I don’t know if I can do it...
I feel so *weak*. Crushed.
I’m not sure I can do it again with these mangled hands, and with the added pressure of knowing that this - probably - is my last shot.
Jesus and his disciples ride off, and leave me to it.
Nothing’s changed from the first time. There’s no knack that I’ve learned. No tricks.
Here we go...
---
It won't go.
Everything’s taken to shaking now.
I’m not sure what’s causing it; the exhaustion; the dehydration; the fear; or the crushing nervousness.
I can't stop it, so I've stopped paying attention to it.
The tyre pops out.
I collapse.
---
The old tube’s too fat and won’t come out.
My patience ran out hours ago; I manhandle the bastard out of there.
Rough as. 
Right. This is it. This is the *last* chance. Botch this and it’ll kill me.
I’m *terrified*.
I handle the new tube like it’s made of tissue paper. I feel like I should be wearing white felt gloves.
Gingerly, delicately, I tuck it into the tyre.
No force. I make sure that it's positioned *perfectly*.
It’s tyre iron time.
*God help me...*
It doesn’t matter how long it takes; I *can not* pinch this tube. If I fuck it up I’ll be waiting around a few hours anyway.
Or all night...
---
There is no doing this gently.
It's just *not* possible.
The bastard of a thing is either going in with force, or not at all.
Fuck it.
Roll the dice.
Tyre wall: shredded.
Hands: beyond.
Nerves: shot.
Tyre: ... *In.*
It's in.
It's done...
I screw on the pump and I’m ready to cry.
I can’t deal with this not working. I’m welling up anyway...
What a fucking mess.
The tube takes the air. The tyre inflates.
It passes squeeze test.
Or does it?
Not enough air and I’ll get a pinch puncture on these rocks. Too much air and I’ll blow the tube right here, right now...
I don’t know... I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know...
Off comes the valve to a rush of air.
Then silence.
I’m going to cry anyway...
I need to go, right *now*.
---
I’m all at sea as I reassemble the bike
*Swooning*.
I’m out of my mind, my body’s really giving it up now.
I know this feeling; out of kilojoules, out of water.
I walk three trips back and forth the twenty strides to "EVERYTHING".
Load up.
I check the pressure with a squeeze and it seems to be the same.
Ok.
Now, the Shrike.
Please. *Please*. I need this.
I turn the key and wait for the fuel pump to finish its little whine.
*Please* start.
*Please.*
I hit the ignition button.
It turns past where it would normally fire.
Keeps turning again and again. *Shit.*
Turning, turning, *coughing*, *coughing…*.
*Please!!*
The Shrike roars to life.
Angry.
Misfires everywhere.
Black flying out the exhaust.
Sounds fucking terrible. Running like a dog.
But running.
It’ll do...
I jump on without taking my hand off the throttle, stomp down into first, drop the clutch, and we’re away.
We’re away, but I’m a mess.
I can't stop *shaking*.
I'm dragging the whole day along with me.
My nerves are shot to hell. I don’t want to play this game anymore.
---
*"NO!"*
No no no no no no no!! *Oh my god.* I *can't!!*
The Shrike is wallowing around; same feeling as the last two times.
I pull over and get off the bike, I keep my hand lightly on the throttle in neutral gear to stop the motor cutting out.
The back tyre isn’t totally flat, but it’s definitely *squashed*
Puncture? Or underdone?
It doesn’t matter. It’s irrelevant.
Only option is to put more air into it and crack on and see what happens.
I take my hand off the throttle, it stays in idle, somehow doesn't die.
The tyre gets a boost.
We ride on.
---
*Everything* is scaring me.
*Every* movement. *Every* wiggle. *Every* noise. *Every, single, time*. I panic.
*Panic!*
I check the tyres.
I panic and panic and panic...
Up pops a village.
*Out of nowhere*.
It’s small, but big enough to have a shop. Selling bottled water.
It's going to be ok.
*It's actually going to be ok.*
---
Water's never tasted so good.
I ask around about a place to stay the night. They have one.
I follow the directions, and then get shown my room.
The bed is covered in little morsels of mouse shit.
Thank god.
I’ll take it.
Stress rolls off me. At least some of it.
It’s going to be ok... I’ll be ok....
I unload the Shrike into the mouse nest, head out the front of the “hotel” and fall into a plastic chair.
Fade to black.
---
*Neck!?*
Aaaaargh! *Jesus*! What’s happened?? My fucking neck!!
I open my eyes and see a crowd of faces staring back at me.
*What the... fuck?*
I squint and blink out my eyes and try to straighten my neck. Won’t happen.
Where *am* I?
The last year comes rushing back to me.
Oh. Right... *Damnit.*
My muscles remind me of the day before my brain can bring it up.
*I don’t remember falling asleep...*
I feel even *worse*, my neck’s *fucked*.
Looks like half the bloody village has shown up to have a look.
Not too close though...
They all look pretty cagey.
Like I'm a stray dog.
I give a half smile and a half wave. I’m not in the mood for this...
I need to eat something.
I’m up, nearly everyone leaves.
Did they think I was dead? Ha! I reckon they might have...
I must look like *shit*.
I'm surprised I didn’t wake up to someone poking me with a stick...
---
I can’t believe I’m here, and with all my stuff.
By rights I should still be back there on the road instead of hoovering this delicious huge plate of rice and beans.
I’m shoving the stuff into my cheeks like a chipmunk, trying to chew and swallow and breathe and talk to my new buddies all at once.
I nearly cough a huge gobful over everyone when I accidentally ram something down my windpipe.
I put away a plate of food the size of a wheelhub in what must be a record time.
I wonder if these guys think that this is normal...
They’re a pleasant enough bunch.
One off them introduces himself as “Papi”. He clears landmines for the Red Cross.
There are landmines, are there? Ah. Righto. *Noted...*
I tell him about my fun introduction to DRC and he says he’ll patch up my two busted tubes for me.
Legend!
While we’re working on that he says that he wants to ride “ensemble” with me tomorrow into Matadi.
*Fuck yes*.
Papi you hero.
This is *exactly* what I need: A wingman.
We get straight to patching the two old tubes.
It looks like I “pinch punctured” the first tube I popped, because the hole was on the rim side, not the tyre side.
The other one I must’ve buggered with the tyre irons because the hole is somewhere near where the rim and the tyre would probably meet.
No surprises there.
Papi and I are nearly done with patching the tubes when a bloke rocks up to the village on a scramble bike with a punctured rear tyre. He looks like he's been riding on it totally deflated.
Papi and I check it out. It’s exactly the same brand and model and spec as my tyre.
*Identical*.
How is that possible??
It looks like we'll be doing a *third* tyre change today.
And when I say we, I mean them. I’ll sit this one out, thank you very much.
Papi goes and fetches his tyre irons.
Tyre irons as long as your arm...
They whip the back wheel off the bike quickly and efficiently, and then Papi peels the tyre off the rim with comical ease.
Foomp. Foomp. Foomp. Foomp... Pop!
Done. *Unbelievable.*
He did in *twenty seconds* what took me *three thousand six hundred seconds*.
No sweat...
I want to cry.
Papi takes one look at my face and laughs his head off. He thinks it’s hilarious.
*That’s* what a tyre change should look like: non-life-threatening.
I *must* get a pair of those tyre irons.
Papi whips out the tube, finds the hole, patches it, puts it back in the tyre, stomps three quarters of the tyre back into the rim with his feet, and peels the rest into the rim in a *single* go.
Job: Done.
No big deal.
I look down at my fucked up hands, touch the swollen and bruised knees from having knelt on the hard rocks for *hours*.
Schools out. I've learnt my lesson.

## Chapter Fifty One
The roosters start their shouting match.
The world is still pitch. Whatever is up there in the roof finishes off it’s particularly industrious night. I'm guessing it's the same thing that was shitting on my bed.
I’m up.
Still knackered. But I can’t sit still.
Today’s the day; the last day of dirt.
*Ever*.
I’m bursting with nervousness.
Even in convoy mode with Papi, I’m still not ok with this.
The idea of another puncture, or something going wrong on the bike, or that donkey piss petrol conking the Shrike out makes me squirm.
I’m not sure that I have the reserves to be able to deal. We’ll see...
Today’s my first "real" day in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The first taste of what the place is really like.
It’s not something that I've been looking forward to.
*At all.*
The Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, formerly just plain Congo.
It's probably the most fucked up place in all of Africa.
And that’s saying something...
Maybe the most fucked up place in the whole world. It’s got to *at least* make the shortlist.
The wars they had here are the biggest wars you’ve never heard of. The biggest wars I’ve never heard of anyway.
They weren’t that long ago; they were in my lifetime.
I never remember seeing it on the news, probably because it had nothing to do with anyone I know. So, naturally, no one I know gives a flying fuck; hooray for humans.
But I’m here now. So, yeah, I do give a flying fuck.
It was *bad*.
It was so bad that people – what people I’m not too sure – but people call it *World War Three*. Seems a poor choice, given that the rest of the world didn’t really want anything to do with it.
But yeah, that bad.
And *super* rapey.
That’s about as eloquent as I think my brain can go this morning; super rapey.
War crimes.
Crimes against humanity stuff.
While the whole country was going to hell in a handbasket, the president - a bloke who renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko Koko Ngbendu wa za Banga, which means "the all-powerful warrior who (I shit you not...) because of endurance and an inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake(!)" – was using all the country's money to fly chartered trips to Paris on the Concorde.
*The* Concorde.
The supersonic one. *That* one. Flown to Paris. From his private, enormous palace in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Congo.
*Just him*.
Him, and the national youth choir...
Seriously, you can’t make this shit up.
What I can’t believe is that Air France was totally cool with it...
Anyway. The country was a total clusterfizzer, a basket case, a deadset mess, and then it *exploded*.
Things turned horrifically, *brutally* violent.
I don’t really want to think about it...
It's the Belgian's fault. Who would have thought? They ruined this place and then left it with nothing. Look it up. It's bananas.
---
I'm not the only one walking around in the shadows of the village on the edge of dawn.
Breakfast is two deep-fried doughballs. It’s all I can find.
I go back to the hotel, take a bucket shower in a basin where the ceiling is only half as tall as I am, and the concrete walls are covered in a slimy, wet growth. There's no light.
It's hard to pour water over your head when there's no room above your head...
I do a shit job and just towel off while I'm still soapy; I ran out of water...
I get dressed and load up.
The Shrike won't start.
I give it a bit, and then hit it again. Nothing.
What do I do? If I keep trying I'll flood it...
What else *can* I do? I hit it again, and let it go and go and go.
It skips a turn and then coughs and roars into life.
So much black smoke...
I don't know how it's still living through this...
I ride out of the hotel courtyard and into a prominent spot in the middle of the village, which is starting to come alive.
I've got to kill the Shrike again to wait for Papi.
I hop off and pace the village.
I want to go *now*.
My brain’s already a blur of bad outcomes...
I’m pacing and pacing. A bloke nearby gets my attention and makes some weird gestures at me. He's trying to tell me something...
It's a *weird* charade. A tin soldier? A man climbing a rope?
What are you on about??
I shake my head at him, shrug, I’ve got no idea mate. “Qwa?? Ce qwa??”
He just keeps doing it. He won’t explain himself...
I say, louder, “Mon ami! Je ne comprend pa... Ce quoi??”
He’s keeping his mouth shut. Won’t *talk*. He stops moving and stands dead still, looks dead ahead.
I cog that the village is *dead silent*. Not a sound...
I look around, 360, and everyone, *everyone*, across the whole village, is standing *dead still*. No one’s moving an inch. No one’s saying a word.
I shut up. Stand frozen.
*What the fuck is going on here?*
There's the most pregnant of pauses.
What are we supposed to be doing??
I’ve never seen anything *like* this.
I don't even dare move my head anymore...
A whistle trills over the silence and the whole village re-boots like someone just pushed play...
Papi shows up. “Papi. Ce quoi, tout ca?”
He say’s something in French and makes charades just like the other bloke. Like he's climbing a rope.
So the whole village shuts down so a bloke can *climb a rope*? *What??*
“Drapo” goes Papi, and points at the sky.
Drapo?
Oh! Drapo! A *flag*!
*Bizarre*.
Papi fills me in.
Apparently, every single day at 7:30am on the dot they raise the national flag in every village in the *whole country*. The entire country needs to be silent and standing for it.
The penalty for non-compliance is an eye-watering $1,000.
I can't really believe that, but I think I might have just gotten away with one...
I also think I’ve been getting away with calling Papi, "Papi", when his name is actually “Baby”. I'm not sure I believe that either...
Anyway. Baby’s ready to rock and roll, but there’s one more thing he has to grab... He heads around the corner, and comes back with a big smile on his face and hands me two big tyre irons.
What a fucking legend.
I love this bloke.
They’re not *really* tyre irons; they’re just two lengths of iron “re-bar” that have had the ends smashed out with a hammer into a sort of spaded paddle.
Agricultural, sure, but it’ll work a charm.
Best gift I’ve ever been given.
I insist on giving him something for it but he insists back that he doesn’t want anything.
What a lad!
Baby jams a ridiculous plastic gridiron helmet on his head that looks like it's been made for a child, The Shrike coughs to life, and we’re away.
---
The warm fuzzys of the thoughtful gift don’t last for long.
I’m *tuned in*.
My whole body and mind are bent on picking up on the early signs of problems.
I jump at shadows again and again and again and again, each time looking down to the tyres, expecting disaster.
Anything sets me off; sounds, wobbles, how “hard” the tyres feel under the terrain...
Baby toots his horn at me from behind. I glance in my mirrors and he’s signalling me to stop.
But I already know what it means...
The tyre’s gone.
I’m *crushed*.
I get off the bike and the tyres are fine. They’re still full of air.
It’s the saddle bags that are on the piss... They’ve somehow shifted violently to one side, even though I’ve been taking things very conservatively.
It makes no sense.
I thank Baby for looking out for me, and straighten out the bags.
What I really need to do is straighten out my head.
I need to calm down.
This worrying about the tyres shit is frying me out.
We crack on for a while till we get to another village where Baby has some Red Cross work to do.
The poor bastard is caked in a layer of red dust from following me much too closely on the bike.
On the way out of the village we hit a checkpoint.
I shit my pants; I can't control it; I don't have the LP for the bike. 
The cop asks me for my name. Where I’m from. What am I doing here.
Then he tells me to have a nice day.
*Really?*
I'll take it.
---
I countdown the next twenty five kilometres, one by one, till, finally, the red dirt fades into tarmac.
I could kiss it.
I get off the bike and dance a jig.
That’s it.
We’re done.
It's the "goodbye dirt-road-Africa" dance.
There's not a shred of melancholy sadness left from yesterday morning. It's been tortured out of me.
Bye.
---
We rush on to Matadi on *really* good tarmac.
And it is a *rush*. I don’t know why, but even on the tarmac I’m still feeling spooked and in a hurry for no reason. I can’t shake off the feeling of urgency. Like I’m being chased. Or it’s a race or something.
I want to be in Matadi *now*.
Halfway there and Baby has to peel off; he's got more work to do.
He asks me for money for the tyre irons.
Of course I'll pay him, but it changes it from a nice gesture to something that seems a little more shrewd and a little less genuine.
It’s cheapened it a bit for me.
I give him twenty dollars and he's overjoyed.
I'm back to being solo...
---
The ride into Matadi is pretty nice; I could totally convince myself that I’m cruising some European foothills (except for the traffic, the demographic, the heat and the humidity, that is).
A couple of painless, shit-your-pants inducing checkpoints later and Matadi comes into view.
It’s pretty speccy.
It looks like a massive, sprawling village that’s been draped over a steep hillside.
I roll into the outskirts of Matadi and, unbelievably, there’s a proper, modern, petrol station there.
I fill the Shrike up right to the brim.
*Straightaway* it sounds healthy again.
It's done very well to put up with that stale, filthy donkey piss they call petrol.
Next stop, Matadi.
---
It’s fucking insane.
*Chaos*.
Completely out of control.
Panda-fucking-monium.
*Packed* roads – even for Africa – with trucks and cars and motorbikes and people and no fucking rules.
I want to shack up on the other side of the hill; over by the Anglolan consulate.
But, I’m not sure I'll make it...
The lions-share of the traffic are trucks carrying shipping containers. They're doing whatever the hell they want to do; they’re *all over* the road, impossible to predict.
The only thing they seem to be consistently and reliably doing is trying to run me over...
It’s close call after close call after close call.
I'll only need to be hit once...
The people aren’t much better.
I’m copping way, way more hissing and yelling and gesturing from the side of the road than is normal.
*Way* more.
With people swarming between the gaps in the trucks and all the other traffic they seem intent on trying to hold me up, trying to get in front of the bike and get in my way. It doesn’t help that they all tower over me.
It’s claustrophobic, belittling. It’s freaking me out.
This is *the bad* Congo, and the people aren’t helping me feel safe. Not one bit.
Then all at once some fucking insane bloke steps off the curb and onto the road right in front of me, shapes up to a fighting stance, screams, and feints to give me a judo chop right in the fucking neck as I ride past.
I nearly prang trying to avoid the hit.
I shit my pants for the second time today.
I wouldn’t have even come *close* to getting out the road if he wanted to belt me.
*What the fuck was that?*
My body's ready to fight someone.
I’m watching the clown in my rear vision mirrors to make sure he’s not chasing me, or that anyone else is going to have a go, or just figure out what the hell that was that he was getting at. But he’s just standing there, screaming something into my back.
I was on edge before, but that adrenaline dump... It's got nowhere to go. I'm off the charts. *Fizzing.*
DRC isn’t looking like a bundle of laughs.
---
I switchback up the hill.
A few more close calls with a few more trucks later and I crest the top, and head down the other side of the slope.
It’s like flicking a switch.
It’s almost *chilled*.
Tale of two cities...
I chomp over to the Angolan consulate through the spaghetti network of roads with relative ease.
The consulate is impressive – a proper, modern, big two storey building with a big perimeter wall and big metal gates. Imposing.
Time to find accommodation then...
---
It’s a clusterfuck.
Of course it is.
Hours of dicking around sizing up a number of shit options, only to go with the first shit option.
I’d fobbed off the first joint the first time around because it’s was outrageously bad value.
Problem was that all the other options make me want to kill myself.
*Truly* bad.
But, that said, I don’t think any of them had the bed covered in little nuggets of mouse shit, so they’re all a leg up from last night.
I’m not in the mood for going uber rough, so I had to go crawling back to the first joint.
I unpack the Shrike.
Time. To. Wander.
---
On this side of the hill things aren’t that bad. In fact, it feels like practically every other oversized village in Africa.
I go get cash. The machine works. And gives me some fresh U.S. dollars. Didn't expect that...
Things are looking on the up and up.
Honestly, I’m just happy to be in some civilisation again.
But, that said, I’m getting eyeballed on the street by *everybody*. I haven’t been eyeballed like this since, well, never...
Nine times out of ten it *seems* to be just out of plain curiosity, but the other time, well, I’m not too sure what *that* look is...
All fun and games.
All part of it.
---
Tomorrow I get the last roll of the dice; Angola visa or bust.
After these last few weeks I don't think I could handle the "death road" to Zambia, or whatever the fuck it's called.
2,000 clicks... 2,000 clicks of "death road".
I don't think it's something I could do even if I wanted to. And I don't want to.
I want that tarmac. I want those easy miles.
I want to get this thing *done.*
I want the end.
