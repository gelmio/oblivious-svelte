# BOOK THREE

## Chapter One

Morning.

Matadi.

Democratic Republic of the fucking Congo.

I front up to those big, imposing gates.

Angolan Consulate.

Last chance. It _has to work_.

I’m a ball of nerves.

I know that every action that I make from here on could be the difference between success and disaster.

Here we go.

_Smile_.

Grinning like a happy maniac I introduce myself to all the guards with the guns - handshakes and smiles all round. I stick around to have a chat with them in some rough French. Once I’m convinced that we’re all buddies, I follow their directions into the building.

Into the room and there’s a bloke standing behind a counter. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before... _Standing_, at a _counter_...

Anyway, he’s busy, so I make myself comfortable along with the other’s in the room and start sizing things up.

On the other side of the counter there are two blokes; a kid in uniform doing all the talking, and an old chubby fellow in plain clothes who’s just hanging around. They’re talking in Portuguese, so that’s no good. I watch carefully. From what I can cog, I reckon it’s the old boy who is the one to watch...

I stew in my seat, watching a clock on the wall tick for every second of nearly half an hour till I’m called up.

_Smile_.

Shake hands, try some Portuguese: “Mew nomee ee Luke”

The kid in the uniform is called something like “Doobrey” and the chubby checker is “Costa”.

So far so good. I try to go further: “Desculpo, senoras, no faalo Portu-ges, faalo Onglaise ooo francaise?”

Looks like we'll be talking in French, but I reckon that might get a little weird; them speaking their second language and me speaking a language I have a habit of butchering.

Well, it’s better than my Portuguese...

I ask them for a transit visa and hand over my passport.

The first question is like a broken record: “Why didn’t you get this in your home country?”

My heart breaks. I'm already scrambling. They can't knock me back that easy. They _can't_.

At least they’re asking me, not telling me – A question, and not a _statement_.

I tell them that I’ve been travelling in Africa for _years_ – which is a bit of an exaggeration... I let it hang there, as though that's explanation enough.

They ask for my motivation letter. I give it to them.

No, not motivation, _vaccination_. The young fella does his best charade of shooting up heroin.

I'm lost in translation already...

I’ve freshly forged my “yellow card” - which is a vaccination certificate - so that it’s got yellow fever written in it. I'm glad for it; they can't trip me up there; it looks legit. (Just to note, I _have_ been vaccinated for yellow fever, I just don't have the stamp; I'm not _insane_.)

They read my letter of motivation, I think that they’re pretty happy that I’ve gone to the effort to translate it into to Portuguese...

Brownie points right there.

They want a photocopy of every single page of my passport, even the blank ones, and photocopies of every page of my yellow card, even the blank ones, and photocopies of any and all of my motorbike’s papers, and two passport photos.

_Progress!_

They ask when I want to leave.

I don’t know what the right answer is... I want to answer anything that doesn’t get the reply “imposseeeebleh”.

I say "next Thursday?" with a question mark...

Wrong answer.

Too conservative.

They say not to bother with any of it today. I should come back after the weekend on Monday morning.

Yes sir, that's fine, sir.

I don’t ask how long it will take, or how much it will cost, this meeting has gone well, I back away quietly.

---

So, I’ve got a weekend to kill.

What to do?

Cyber.

Soul destroying.

Things have not been going well... My extended time "off the grid" without warning, has whipped my family into a frenzy.

When I say my family, I mean mum.

I go through the messages...

Imaginations of the violence being done to her son in the Congo after radio silence has gotten the better of her.

She finally snapped a few days back and had a meltdown.

I feel sorry for dad. He’s the one who has to tidy it all up.

I’m torn between sympathising with mum, and wondering at what point the umbilical cord is going to get cut...

I know already that her creepy answer would be “never”, but for me right now, lateish twenties would be fine.

Anyway. Like most sons who can do no wrong, I can do no wrong.

One message clears everything up.

I still reckon she’s going to kill me with her own hands if I keep this shit up.

After putting out that fire there's nothing left to do, and the connection here is so slow that it's like pulling teeth.

Time. To. Wander.

I head off downhill towards the river Congo.

It’s a bit of a walk, about an hours worth, but I’ve got nothing better to do than to walk through generic, mad Africa.

A warm, hot, smokey hour later and I hit the river and an impressive suspension bridge.

Looks pretty new, pretty solid. It’s completely out of keeping with the theme of the village.

The river Congo is moving along underneath it with a gentleness that hides the monstrous amount of water that it’s shifting. Throw in some gentle rolling, uninhabited, green mountains in the backdrop and it’s all quite neatly picturesque.

The guys with the guns won't let me cross.

I soak it in for a while and start the long walk back.

_Swoon_.

The world spins ever so slightly and sickeningly.

I can’t think straight. Can’t stand straight.

It’s so heavy that I have to stop... I bend lower to the ground to decrease the height of the fall a little bit.

Unpleasantly drunk, _wasted_, yet sober.

_I’m in trouble._

Something’s _very_ not right.

I strain against it. Grimacing.

It comes off a bit. I have to walk...

I can't think straight, but I can walk.

I’m ok. It’s ok. _Keep walking._

---

For the whole hour back to hotel I can’t focus.

Not really.

I don’t _feel_ like _me_.

I can’t stop fucking _swooning_. I feel like I’ve been spun in circles over and over and my head can’t catch up when my body stops turning.

Woozy.

I've been dying to lie flat. I even thought of doing it right there on the street...

I get back to the hotel.

Crash.

_What the fuck is happening to me?_

The room stops spinning.

What now? I've got nothing to do...

I read a book to kill some time and take my mind off it for a bit.

_War and Peace._ It’s been a grind. My e-reader say's I'm only 54% through...

For a book like this, reading to halfway has to be the equivalent of reading a shitload of normal books; every time I sit down to read it for what feels like an age I only lop off another 1%.

Fuck this.

I’d rather watch paint dry.

Or head to the “cyber”...

Yep. Done. I'm off.

---

This is just as bad...

_Swoon_. Another _episode_.

I grab the screen of my laptop tightly to hold on to something that’s not moving as the whole room does cartwheels around my head.

I nearly fall off my chair; my balance is _rooted._

Choked up. Spinning out.

I freak - the fuck - _out_.

I’ve righted myself. I _know_ I'm up straight, but it doesn't _feel_ like that. My head's lolling around. I can't _think!_

Hospital??

_Should I go to hospital??_

I can't _deal_ with that...

Big, panicked, breaths through my nose.

Was I holding my breath?

My head's all fizzy, like my hair is electric on my scalp.

Am I hyperventilating now?

It’s time to go...

I throw some dirty money at the lady who runs the joint and rush back to the hotel room.

Onto the bed.

Lie flat.

Still.

---

And that’s where I stayed.

More or less for the rest of the day.

And then all of the next day.

I feel ok when I’m lying down, and I’m normal when I’m sleeping, I think...

Every time I go to go get up I feel that faint wooziness coming on.

The only time I take the chance to get up is to eat; because I have to.

And even when I’m lying down, my breathing won’t take care of itself. At least that’s the impression that I get. It *should *be something that just happens without conscious attention - of course - but I keep getting the feeling that when I'm not paying attention to it I'm not breathing enough.

Or I'm breathing too much...

So, I do it myself. I literally do my own breathing.

It’s exhausting.

Inevitably, I get it wrong. When that happens I feel faint. I’m never sure if I've been underdoing it or overdoing it, and I don’t know whether to breathe slower or faster to fix it.

I have to cop it all day - there's no alternative.

Even lying flat out on the bed, watching the ceiling, I still feel nothing like _normal_.

_Manually controlling my breath?_ What’s _wrong_ with me?

I should be fine; I’m not exerting myself, I’m getting plenty of rest, I’m eating plenty of food, drinking plenty of water.

I don’t feel crook.

Physically I'm fine. I couldn’t say a single thing that’s wrong.

So what’s going on then? Why can’t I even stand without losing my bearings and feeling like falling?

What’s going on?

I feel only a _sliver_ like myself.

What happens if it gets worse? Worse than _this_... What happens if it gets so bad that I can’t help myself anymore? What if I wake up in the middle of the night and I _can’t move_? _Can’t get help_? What if the room spins, spins worse, worse than I can handle... what if it doesn’t stop? What if I fall over and can’t get up again?

No one knows where I am... No one knows that something’s wrong with me.

I’m completely isolated out here.

I feel every ounce of the solitude. It's _crushing_. All day, every second I'm aware of it.

I just wish someone was here with me. Anyone. It would change _everything_.

Instead, I have to make the conscious, constant effort to hold back the screaming panic that’s _right there_, all the time. The tether is as thin as a thread.

I’m at breaking point. I can feel it.

All the time.

And I can’t take it...

It’s not bursts, it’s a _continuum_. Small forevers.

Forevers that don't break; that don't let up.

I can't do forever...

Sticking my head in the sand isn’t going to fix it. What are the alternatives?

Do I go to the hospital now?

Fuck I hate that idea... Not here - not in this place...

But what else is there? What else can I do?

I _can't_ go home. Out of pure pigheadedness. Bloodymindedness. I _won't_ leave now. Not unless it gets worse...

There's really nothing else. Either go to a hospital, go home, or keep going.

Here are my ranked thoughts on what it _actually_ might be:

"Very, very bad": I have cancer in my brain. Angry cancer. And this is "End Game".

"Very bad": I have something that I've picked up - Malaria or Typhoid or something of that ilk - or I have a parasite that’s eating my brain. Something exotic and African. Something you get from showering in river water. When it chews I _swoon_.

"Bad": I've fucked my brain on weed - which I smoked one time and had a similar "I'm not me/spinning room/out of control" reaction to. With the fucked brain, I'll be having these episodes at random for the rest of my life - but they are harmless.

"Not so bad": these episodes are a bad vertigo or something that's transient and not specific to me or my situation. Just shit luck.

"Also not so bad": this is my body’s way of reacting to the stresses I’ve been having.

So yeah, that’s the rap sheet of bandits.

That’s what I reckon. But what do I know? Frag all. I only have guesses.

I think that’s what’s chewing at me; I don’t know what it is. It kills me not to know if this is going to get better by itself or if it’s going to get worse the longer I avoid doing something about it.

That uncertainty...

Well, there’s always suicide.

I’m not thinking of it. Well, that’s not true. I _am_ thinking of it. But thinking of something isn’t the same as considering something.

That’s different.

I’m not _considering_ suicide.

That’s absurd.

But the thought of it, and knowing it’s there, well, it’s weirdly comforting. Something’s telling me though - morally or ethically or whatever - that suicide's not right. That it's a bad option.

I shouldn’t be thinking of it like a comfort.

But I do; it feels like a parachute, like a handbrake. I think... It’s like no matter how bad it gets, there’s never no getting out of it.

I’m not _trapped_ here.

At the very end, there’s _always_ that option, it’s _always_ there.

It's an option I’d _never_ consider, _never_ entertain - but an option, nonetheless.

---

Monday.

Consulate.

It's the first time I've left my room in days, except occasionally to eat.

Meals have been skipped.

I've been sleeping long hours. Sleeping is the only time when things seem to be taking care of themselves - like normal. That can’t be a bad thing, so I’ve been spending most of my time trying to sleep.

I've tried to read books, but I can’t stay focused long enough to make any progress; I catch myself reading the same sentence or paragraph over and over and over again because I can’t pay attention. None of it’s going into my head. All I see are words, and my brain can't make meaning. It might as well be in Swedish.

When I try to force it for too long I start to feel lightheaded again, and start to feel things slipping out of control.

So I sleep. It’s my only respite. When I can’t do that, I stare blankly at the ceiling.

I've emerged from the weekend squinting and with a limb-numbing lethargy.

I look like shit. Sickly.

The morning has been an out of body experience.

I've been busy getting all my shit in a pile, armed and ready for the Consulate, photocopying _everything_.

When I find myself talking with the guard at the front gate I’m not sure how I’ve gotten here...

Time to switch on.

This is important.

I know it. But I can't snap the woozy fog...

Should I try again tomorrow? I might feel better then...

And do what? Spend another day in that bed?

No. Get on with it. This _has_ to be done.

I head in.

My mate behind the counter, Doubre, doesn’t seem happy to see me. There’s no chubby Costa either.

Despite being the last thing I feel like doing, I plaster a smile on my face. I try to make small talk.

He takes my pile of papers off me and starts with the passport.

He’s flipping through it and then says something.

Something bad.

He’s pointing me out something. He’s not impressed... He’s saying words to the effect that it’s no good because my passport needs _three_ blank pages for stamps and I only have _two_ blank pages left.

_Panic_.

I hate hate hate this. Loath it. Tiny little bullshit that can get you tripped up. If he wanted to he could help me. I know it. Instead, he’s being a piece of shit. He knows how important this is for me. He knows this is my last shot. He must; I could throw a rock to the Angolan border. But he’s going to reject me for being one page short of the requirement, just because he can.

This would be so _easy_ for him to let slide.

I hate him.

I scramble. And default to an old tactic: pretending I don't understand the French.

I'm hoping he can’t be bothered explaining it to me again and again and again in his second language and eventually just thinks “fuck it” and gets on with it.

It doesn't work; he’s remarkably patient...

I tell him I’ve got _another_ passport - an Australian one - back at the hotel that’s good. _Lots_ of pages. Nothing but empty pages. He tells me to go and get it and he wants all the photocopies for that one as well.

I’m not dead in the water yet...

I’m not too sure how they’re going to deal with my dual citizenship, and I've been keeping that hidden in an attempt to avoid misunderstandings; like them thinking that I'm some sort of James Bond spy. But I've gotta give it a go.

What else can I do?

---

Second crack.

I've got the copies.

You wouldn't know that I'm shaking, but I am.

This time it's just Costa the chubby behind the counter.

I hand everything over.

He seems confused.

He shuffles through the papers again and again. He can’t figure it out, and then asks me in French something along the lines of “why are you applying for two people?”

_Shit_.

It’s sort of a fair question; my passport photos couldn’t be more un-alike. One is an eighteen year old boy; the other is a twenty six year old man. Even I can hardly connect the two. What chance does a total stranger have?

I try to explain to Costa that they’re _both_ me, and explain what Doubre was saying. He just shakes his head and gives me back all of my Australian papers and copies.

The British ones are fine.

Halle-fucking-lujah.

Costa: my saviour.

I fill in all the necessary forms. Funnily enough, it’s the first visa in a frighteningly long time that I haven’t had to lie on. Not once no fabricated hotel bookings or letter of invitations or two references. None of it.

B-e-a-utiful.

They’re running out of things to trip me up on.

Costa tells me it’s going to cost $101.

U.S. dollars...

One hundred and one dollars, for a _transit_ visa that lasts _ten days_.

It's the worst value visa on the planet.

Do I care? _Nope._

I’m cashed up and ready to do this deal _now_, but Costa says that’s no good. I can’t pay _here_. Instead, I’ve got to go and make a “bank deposit”.

_Pain_ in the _arse_.

I can see why they do it – not handling the money themselves leaves a lot less wriggleroom for corruption and cooking the books.

Whatever. I’m just glad to be making progress.

---

The bank's a goddamn trek. Half a village away.

I’m not doing well.

All I want to do is lie down for a bit to clear this dizzy light-headedness.

How do I, in French, say "Hello, I'd like to make a bank deposit to the Angolan Consulate for $101 to pay for a transit visa, please"?

This isn't going to be easy...

I try to open the front door, but I can't.

It’s not locked... There’s just someone blocking the door on the other side.

I poke my head in, and it’s packed.

_Packed_, packed.

There’s hardly enough room inside for me to muscle in through the front door. It's standing room only and everyone is shoulder to shoulder.

It's not a small room either, this is a big bank; it’s just _that_ busy.

What a fucking mess.

So much for worrying about my French. That’s the least of my problems.

What now?

I muscle through the crush to get to the tellers and plead my case. They send me to the other side of the bank.

And again.

And again...

It takes a long, _long_ time before I finally hook a fish and I get taken into the back.

We head through a lot of random corridors, with random people, getting told to wait and then being picked up again at random intervals.

Something feels very shady about this. Like I'm getting through the layers of security into some sort of unlicensed dog fighting or something...

There are locals carrying around _armfuls_ of the local currency, walking through the corridors like worker bees carrying nectar.

I get marched down a set of stairs and through a dimly lit basement. It's _filled_ with a small army of money counters, crunching through _piles_ of currency.

Yep. Shady as fuck...

_What’s going on here?_ I get the feeling I’m seeing something that’s definitely not for my eyes. What do they think that I want to do?

Did I mess up my French?

I'm escorted through the piles of cash and up another flight of steps and told to wait outside a door with a small group of people.

A cantankerous middle aged woman in one of those see-through green visor caps that wouldn’t look out of place at a smoky poker table pokes her angry head around the blacked-out door from time to time to pull someone else into the room...

When it’s finally my turn I head in and see what I’ve gotten myself into...

Turns out I’d got it right, which is more astounding than if I’d gotten it wrong; this _is_ where you come to make a bank deposit...

It's painless. I pay in cash.

That done, and with a little bank slip in hand, I head back - without an escort this time - through the money counters and maze of corridors and the crush of the mob, out the front and into the light of day.

African banks are fucking crazy.

I make a beeline back to the Consulate. At the desk it’s Doubre this time, and some new player - a middle aged woman.

I introduce myself, her name's Maria, said with a Portuguese flair.

They go and get my file and come back. Maria flicks through my British passport and says that there aren’t enough blank pages left.

_Fuck_.

Doubre wants to know where my other passport is.

_Fuck!_

Maria wants to know _what other passport?_

The bastards are ganging up on me...

I panic.

_Shit_.

I explain that Costa said that it was all good. Can we see Costa?? Please?

They oblige.

Please, please, please, please...

We find Costa somewhere in the building behind a desk.

He saves my bacon, _again_. It's _fine_.

I leave the bank slip with them and I’m told to come back in two days.

That's not exactly confidence inspiring; I’ve been in _that_ situation before...

But, I’m still in the game.

---

Two days.

Two days with the uncertainty hanging over my head.

All of my uncertainty.

It sits on me.

What’s the longest amount of time I've spent with zero outside stimulus? Just me in my head, on a bed?

It’s _maddening_.

Nothing’s changed. Nothing's improved.

There’s still not a single waking moment when I feel anything close to “normal”, and there’s the constant threat that any second, _imminently_, everything could go balls up in a way that's irreversible.

Unrecoverable.

Forty eight hours of it...

It’s simmered my nerves to the point where I’m going to snap.

I’m scared of what that might mean.

I’m not taking care of myself.

This isn’t good for me, and I know it, but I can’t make myself do things, because what if that makes _it_ worse. Whatever “_it_” is.

How the fuck am I going to _ride??_

I wish there was someone here with me.

---

D-Day.

I’ve still got an invisible tremor in my bones that I can’t stop.

Walking up to the gates, I’m so tense and nervous I can’t stand it.

They’re going to reject me on a technicality. I know it.

Fuck, I can’t deal with this anymore.

It’s too much.

I head through the gate and head in.

It’s Doubre the arsehole, again. No knight-in-shining-armour Costa the Chubby.

_Smile_.

Doubre, the shithead, says that they don’t have my visa.

Come back in the afternoon.

My tension ratchets a notch.

I don’t know if I can take it.

I keep pumping myself up to leave the hotel room and face the prospect of getting rejected and they keep leaving me in the dark.

Fuck. What if they say they’re going to send the application to Luanda again, like they did back in the other Congo...

I don’t think I could take that.

I think that’ll be my breaking point.

---

Another half a day lying in the head spin of the dingy hotel room.

I head off to the place that I’ve been heading to eat every single meal during my time here.

It’s a little tin shack just up the road from the hotel.

Staying close to that hotel bed where the world stops spinning has been the priority, but I’ve also lucked out for my week here because the food is some of the best I’ve had in the whole trip.

There's something chewy called _quanga_, which is like eating a tasty rubber dildo, along with three other piles of indistinguishable goop and some beans. Okra’s in there somewhere, not that I've ever known what "Okra" is... The other goop tastes like fish, though I’m not sure that it’s supposed to... It tastes pretty damn good.

Addictively good, in fact.

A middle aged bloke comes into the shack with one of those nasty little double sided razor blades. I’ve never known what they’re used for... It’s just a flat, thin piece of flimsy metal the size of a matchbox with each edge of the metal honed to a shiver-inducing sharpness.

Scalpel sharp.

No one seems surprised when the chef comes out of the kitchen, sits down on the razor man’s stool, and gets a good, dry, face shave. Totally routine.

Razor man’s paying very careful attention to what he’s doing, just like a barber might give someone a straight shave, I guess, chipping away with careful little flicks. But it still looks rough as guts, not to mention bloody dangerous.

For me, it’s like having a TV dinner; meal and entertainment at the same time. I forget the consulate and the visa. I sit, rapt, while absently shovelling food in my mouth; ready to see if something goes horribly, horribly wrong.

I wonder how many people he’s shaved with _that_ blade in the neighbourhood? I bet it’s a number close to “everyone”.

Did I mention that the chef is a woman?

Yep.

And she’s getting her face shaved.

It’s _actually_ happening.

Casually as you like. No one’s batting an eyelid.

If we’re being honest, it’s a pretty important service. Hair gets pretty out of hand here if not kept in check. I guess faces are no different.

And, when I say face, I don’t mean the old five-o’clock-shadow either.

I mean _face_.

_All of it._

Forehead. Nose. Cheeks. All come in for close attention.

The shaver guy _literally_ chips away with the razor blade over the _entire_ surface of her face, leaving only the eyebrows, eyelashes and eyelids behind.

With a _razor blade_, for Christ sakes. Talk about razor burn... that’s gotta hurt like hell!

Razorman’s played knifey spoony before, he’s an _operator_, and he’s done the job with impressive speed and efficiency.

He eyeballs me and my pre-pubescent, many-month-old, scraggly effort at a beard and holds the razor up and raises his eyebrows.

Nah thanks mate, I’ll pass this time...

---

I head back to reality, back to the consulate, and the tension ratchets one more time.

I’ve been in and out enough now for the security to just give me a knowing nod to let me through.

I head to the counter inside and it’s still Doubre the douchebag. He sees me and before I can say a word he walks off.

Is he _avoiding_ me?

Long minutes pass.

What the fuck is going on?

He comes back and hands me my bashed up passport.

I look at him and then back to the passport and back to him.

“Ce ici??” I point. _Is it here??_

“Wee”.

I rifle through the passport, and there, on the last page, is a new, full page sticker.

“Angola Visa” is written across the top.

I’ve never been happier.

This is better than all Christmases, all birthday’s, all anything’s all put together.

Pure, euphoria.

It’s _over_.

It’s finally _over._

I check the details, and I’ve never been happier for a shittier visa.

Single entry, _five_ days.

Five!

They've fucked me on the duration.

At one hundred and one bucks, it’s hands down the worst value visa I’ve ever had.

But I could hug Doubre, the piece of shit.

I try to maintain my professionalism till I’m at least out of the gates and around the corner.

But I can’t.

I fist pump and shadow-box my way through the consulate courtyard. I jump and click my heels as I walk through the gates and down the street.

---

Today’s it.

Goodbye to “_Africa_ Africa”.

Finally. Paved roads. Proper infrastructure. Modern living.

Bring that on.

I’ll miss _Africa_ Africa, in a Stockholm Syndromey kind of way... But I can’t wait to just relax and, I don’t know, eat a tub of yoghurt.

Whatever.

It was about the time that I got the passport and Angola visa in my hot hands that I’ve started to feel a lot like myself again.

It’s weird, and it makes me think that it might somehow be related.

I’m not totally there yet... I still feel a little weird and, well, _off_. But, for 90% of the time my head is clear, I can think like I normally do, and I have my coordination back. I feel “orientated”. Planted.

_Here._

My head’s back on my shoulders.

But the whole week of woozy spinning has left me feeling a bit fragile and vulnerable.

Honestly, it's scared me shitless.

I don’t know what’s going to happen next, and the speed at which an _episode_ comes on has left me pretty spooked.

But, I've got to get on with it.

I've got one last hurdle for this trip: Getting through the border.

From there, it’s five big days of riding to traverse _massive_ Angola – which won’t be a cakewalk, but at least the whole country has tarmac, which will help. Bigtime. After that I'm on to Namibia and lovely, modern South Africa; both of which do visas on entry.

Then I’m home and hosed.

It’s close. It _feels_ close. So close that I can, maybe, measure the "time to home" in weeks. Maybe even _days_.

Bring _that_ on.

The Shrike gets loaded up and I take one last look at the hotel that I’ve wallowed in for the last week with something approaching disgusted nostalgia. It’s been good to me, but Jesus it’s sucked.

I head off.

It’s a darkly overcast day and the whole town feels gloomy and _damp_.

The border is spitting distance from Matadi.

In ten minutes I’m onto the "border road", which - unsurprisingly - is untarred and a bit of a mess.

It's not long to the border proper.

It’s got a little mini village sprouted up around it, but all of it still feels like an extension of Matadi.

The strategy for this side of the border, and really for all exit borders anywhere, is to avoid Customs at all costs; I don't have a Laissez-Passer (LP) for the bike, which is definitely something that border Customs would crack the shits over.

I park up right up at the boom gate.

It’s another one of these posts where it’s not particularly obvious what’s what.

I get handballed about for a bit and I’m at risk of looking like that guy who’s got no fucking idea what he’s doing – ripe to being taken advantage of...

Through more arse than class I get picked up by a middle aged old bloke in a _very_ serious looking military uniform.

I get the feeling he’s the boss around here...

His hands look like a packet of twisties; totally, uselessly crippled. Gnarled like old tree roots. They look to me like they’re good for nothing but picking your nose, but, sure enough, he manages to shove a pen between the digits and somehow starts writing down my details in a massive fat ledger book.

It’s excruciating to watch.

I feel like taking over for him, but I’m not sure that he’d go for that - he seems to be the proud type, what with that fancy uniform he's got and all...

I spend the very, very long watch wondering how his fingers ended up like that, and if it had anything to do with the DRC’s colourful past.

Who knows? I’m not about to ask.

He finishes off the thirteenth labour of Hercules and tells me to go see Customs.

Shit. Can’t do that... My French suddenly melts into shit, and, by magic, I don't "understand" anything he's telling me; I hope he just thinks I'm an imbecile and gives me the stamp.

We go in circles again and again and again. He’s as tenacious and as patient with me as he was with his handwriting...

_No stamps till I see Customs._ He won't budge.

It's a first; no one at Immigration has ever sent me to Customs before... Not for _leaving_ a country anyway...

Had to happen when I don't have the papers, didn’t it?

_Here we go.._.

I head around to the Customs building I'd been ducking and weaving to avoid since I got here.

I've no idea how I’m going to tackle this...

I stump up to the bloke at the front and go through the usual introductions of apologising for my terrible French with a big smile and handshakes all round.

He’s another one from the population of people who’ve never smiled once in their life. Not _once_.

I explain that he needs to go and tell the Immigration guy that it’s ok to stamp me out of the country.

“Papy-airs.” Papers. _Great._

All I can give him are the bike's flimsy rego papers. They’re a bit of a fragile mess these days, not unlike me, so I add “dousa-mon, dousa-mon” which is how I imagine the word is spelt for “be gentle with that”.

He looks all over the rego with a face of confused annoyance.

He tells me that they’re no good. He wants to know where my carnet is...

Fucking _great_. Here we go...

I tell him that that’s all I have, with no other explanation, because I don’t really have one... I figure that all I’m going to do is hang myself if I keep talking, so I pretend to be very interested by something else going on in the fairly busy room.

It’s not going to be enough...

He continues to scrutinise my papers and then accidentally tears them in half.

_God damn it!_ They so very nearly made it all the way, my battered and bashed papers... Cleaved forever.

I'm _furious_.

I revert to some English that the boss wouldn’t know the meaning of and let fly. He gets the gist...

I think that he thinks that he’s just fucked a document that is a little more important than it actually is...

He freaks out, says it’s all ok, hands it all to his stand-by lackey and points us out the door and back to Immigration with instructions to give me the ok.

Lucky break, I guess...

The passport disappears with the lackey somewhere deep into the Immigration building and they won’t let me follow it to keep an eye on things; which I’m _not_ a big fan of.

I wait around outside for a long time. I'm the squeaky wheel, making a lot of noise to anyone who will listen to me...

My mate the boss comes out front with the passport in his fucked up fingers. Stamped.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is in the fuckin can.

Half way done...

## Chapter Two

Angola.

There’s a massive, _massive_ mob out front of the Immigration building, which, apparently, won’t open till nine o’clock.

No bother; I don’t have to crush a massive distance today. It'd be handy, but I don't _have_ to.

At nine there’s a mad scramble to get into the Immigration building the moment the doors open. One of the officials spots me out in the crowd and comes and grabs my passport and drags me in.

Not sure why I should get special treatment - I was well back in the crowd - but I’m not about to refuse it.

Straightaway the language barrier is a nightmare. Border crossings in French are hard enough, but at least I can make myself understood.

Portuguese? Forget about it. I thought I had enough of the basics under my belt after spending a few days doing audio lessons.

Nope.

I can’t explain _shit_.

It takes a while of frustrated charades from both sides to finally get some progress.

I get my passport thrown onto the pile, and from there it's just a question of watching and waiting.

It’s a slow grind.

Even though all anyone's doing is picking up a passport, finding a page and stamping it, it all seems to happen in slow motion.

A fair whack of dead time passes before I’ve finally got my stamp and we can move on to Customs.

---

Customs doesn’t exist...

At least, I can't find it.

It’s driving me nuts.

Each person I talk to sends me off somewhere new, somewhere newly wrong.

After a lot of frustrated asking around in butchered Portuguese I’m ready to throw in the towel and roll the dice for Angola just like I did for DRC.

Some guy comes over to me and tells me to follow him, and we head into an office where all the furniture is still covered in plastic, like they just moved in.

He asks for my carnet; that god-like document for the bike that's sort of like a passport that I should have but I don't.

I’ve no idea how to do this dance in Portuguese...

Passavant. Laissez-passer. Temporary import permit. All the usual work-arounds. I say all of them. The guy's got no idea what I’m talking about. He wants to see my _carnet_...

We go around and around and around in circles. He wants to help me - I can tell - but he can’t. He only seems to understand carnets, and doesn’t seem to understand how I’ve come all this way without one.

He’s looking at my rego papers with his pen like he’s trying to find the part of it that he writes in and stamps...

I pull my other Congo “passavant” out of my bag to give him an example of what I’m talking about.

He scrutinises it and doesn’t look pleased. Says something in Portuguese that sounded a bit like “Sorry, haven’t got any of these...”

He flips it over onto the blank side and starts writing something on it.

Scribbles a signature.

Whacks a wet stamp onto it.

Solemnly hands it back to me.

Hilarious.

Full marks for effort, I guess...

_It'll do._

I've no idea what he's written on that paper, but, whatever it is, I'm sure I can talk my way around it.

In any case, it’s better than nothing.

Righto then. It’s already past eleven o'clock. I don’t know where those two hours evaporated off to.

But I don’t care.

I’m _in_.

_Africa_ Africa is finally done.

It’s the beginning of the end.

What a relief.

---

I peel off down the shitty border road.

I pass a shitty border town.

The road for some reason gets shittier rather than better.

It's gone rocky and bouncy and there's fuck all out here.

I laugh.

I guess _Africa_ Africa wasn't done with me just yet.

I have some fun with it, as I bounce and zigzag all over the narrow rock hop.

_The last hurrah..._

Coming around each new bend I’m leaning out to the side to try to catch my first glimpses of the good tarmac with a grin on my face.

Can’t be long now.

I pass a tiny village that looks _dirt_ poor. No corner shops or any semblance of modernity whatsoever. Just village people in a handful of thatched mud huts along the roadside. They're just taking the air - there's nothing else for them to do.

It’s _way_ sub-par, even for Africa.

I’m chompin for the tarmac. _I can’t wait_. Hankering badly for it.

I make a trickling progress.

It's one of the worst roads I’ve been on in the whole trip... Hard. Technical. So _bouncy_.

Just a mess with nothing but reedy scrub lining the road and the occasional tree.

Is this a _“Savannah"_? Could be...

I pass another dirt poor village.

And then another.

No traffic, very few people.

It all feels half-way abandoned.

I go and I go and I go, and it’s still dirty, bouncy, tricky rock track.

_Where’s the tarmac??_

---

Two hours pass. _Two hours_.

Not even a sniff of tarmac.

_Piss on this_. I’ve had enough.

I’m far enough from the border now, right? There’s been enough villages gone past to warrant a proper road now. _Surely._

My expectation of getting in a couple of hundred easy clicks before the end of the day has been shat all over.

_It wasn’t supposed to be like this._

Nothing like this.

Every man and his dog has told me that the roads in Angola are good enough to eat off.

I'm not prepared for this...

I light up the GPS.

I’ve made no progress. _None_.

Haven’t even put a dent in the line I wanted to chart today. The last two hours of hard work have been for close to nought.

At this pace, on this fucking road, I might be able to get - maximum - another hundred clicks before it’s dark. _Maximum_.

And if something goes tits up? If _I_ go tits up? Well. Fucked then, I guess.

A deep heat starts in the middle of my sternum and it quickly invades my whole chest, spreading outwards all over, crawling all over. It runs up my neck, tightening up, strangling me. Choked.

I’m ready to pull over the bike and bawl my eyes out.

I want to. But it won’t happen for me. For some reason it all just stays bottled there. It won't spill over the edge and be let out.

I don’t know why. I wish it would.

Self-preservation?

I don't know.

I don't skip a beat, and keep bouncing on.

_I was finished with dirt_.

I think that’s what’s worse. I’d finished it. Celebrated. _Danced a jig_. I was expecting a cakewalk and I’ve got a grind. It’s blindsided me. Oblivious.

I haven’t got _any_ food with me. Not a bite.

I’m running pretty low on water. A smidgen swishing around the bottom of my bottle.

I _need_ tarmac and I need _proper villages_ with food and water. I need them soon.

---

Another hour.

I'm desperate.

Zig-zagging, up and down, bouncing, grinding, rocky, first gear crawl.

I hit a village.

Actually, calling it a "village" would be kind... It’s a handful of buildings. One’s got bricks - which is a first. Promising, even. The rest are all small huts.

The joint looks deserted. Though there’s one bloke that I can see, and no one else.

The moment I pull to a stop I’m drenched in sweat.

It won't evaporate and just pools everywhere, the air's so stale.

It’s fucking warm.

It’s those thick, dark clouds overhead that are doing it...

I start up a conversation with the last man alive. I get the pleasantries out of the way and skip the small talk altogether and get down to business – my Portuguese isn’t hot enough for chat, and trying it on in English or French would be worse...

On to charades.

I gesture my fingers near my mouth like an expressive Italian: Food?

Shake of the head from last man standing: No.

_Shit_.

I tilt an invisible can of coke into my mouth: Water?

Shake of the head and even a wag of the finger this time: Nope.

_Fuck._

I can go without food, and go hungry, but water? Well, no... Not in these conditions.

Shrug of the shoulders from me with hands up near the shoulders like an Egyptian carrying invisible turds: Where?

He points down the road the way I’m going.

“Quanto?” from me, which is about as eloquent as I’m going to get for "how much?" in Portuguese.

“Quanto? Mmmmmm… _bar bar bar bar_ noventa queelometros”

"Noventa!?" Did he just say _noventa_?

Noventa sounds a lot like the Italian "nove". Nove is nine...

Ninety then? _Ninety_?

Better fucking not be.

Ninety clicks will have me there, at this rate, by dusk tonight. And that’s not going to work. Clearly.

I point at the ground and stamp on it with my boots, and do a flat hand dance from the 80's: Tarmac? I take a punt at the Portuguese, “Tarmaco? Bitumeno? Ashphalto?”

Zombie apocalypse survivor perks up.

“_Assfallto?_”

Ha! Who said language was hard? "Si! Assfallto? Quanto?"

_I Am Legend_ points again, down the road. “Assfallto _bar bar bar_ Noventa.”

Fuck. Off.

This is a fucking ordeal now...

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.

I make like a guy taking a standing nap on prayer hands: Somewhere to sleep?

“_Bar bar bar bar bar bar_, Noventa. Noventa.”

Oh _god_.

Four questions, four answers. Ninety kilometres. Ninety. With _nothing_ between.

I’m _fucked_.

“Nomay de villa?” _Name of the village?_

“Nome? Tom-boco”

Tomboco. I’ve got to make it to Tomboco. Fast.

“Obrigado sinyor”

I vault onto the Shrike and ride on.

---

Like a man possessed.

I’m _freaking out_.

My head’s a blur of maths; divisions to calculate arrival time.

What's not taken up by that is completely dedicated to shit your pants “what if” scenarios.

The seemingly endless deal breakers that the Shrike could throw up.

Or _I_ could throw up...

My concern for the tyres is bordering on a deranged phobia. The knobs on the tyres have been whittled over the thousands of kilometres down to a nub.

I’m _keenly_ aware of the quality of inner tubes that I’ve got in both wheels: Chinese wrapping paper.

And this road is _Punctureville_.

And there’s no traffic out here. _None._ If something does go balls up, it’s going to be a long walk or a long wait, and, even after the long walk or wait, there’s still _no food_, no _water_.

What if my body decides to crap out and have another “episode”, another swoon. What if I can't stop it and it won't go away? What then?

As my head churns and I think it can't get any worse, the track deteriorates.

It’s an absolute _dog’s breakfast_.

The ruts are so _deep_, and the wheel tracks so completely all over the place. I’m convinced that this is impossible on anything with more than two wheels. Maybe two might be too many; it'd be hard to do this on foot...

_One_ mistake - one lapse of attention on this skinny track - and we’ll slide off the road into a trench on the roadside as deep as I am tall.

_Fucked._

This road is supposed to be _modern_ and fucking _tarmac_.

I pass a group of kids and they all freak the fuck out and run off screaming, _terrified_.

Never seen that before...

Some of them throw themselves into the bushes in a way that looks like it’s bloody painful. All to get away from me and the Shrike...

It's _remote_ out here...

---

At the next "village" there’s a sign for a restaurant.

_Hallelujah_.

Deliverance. I can fill up to my gills with water and chow.

I poke my head in, it's empty...

I ask around the village about the restaurant. They point me down the road, “Tomboco”.

I insist _again_. Surely there must be _some_ food. What’s everybody else eating?

Finally, someone brings me some bananas.

_That's a start._

I try to charade water. But something's getting lost in translation.

After a lot of confusion I cog that they’re telling me that they could go and get me some water from a well... The only thing worse than the current situation would be the current situation with me blowing chunks of that greasy omelette breakfast out my mouth, or otherwise shitting it through the eye of a needle.

"Non, _obrigado_ sinyor".

---

Another hour.

I slide past a woman on the track who looks absolutely _petrified_. As I go by she lets off a screaming, sabre-rattling, spear-shaking _war cry_ right in my face.

“YEEEEAAAAAAH-AH-AH-AH-AH!!”

Bet I look just as freaked out as she does...

It’s not like I fucking snuck up on her; you can hear the Shrike from a mile down the road.

What the fuck is all this about then? First the screaming, terrified kids, and now this woman's shrieking in my face.

She must think I’m one of the riders of the apocalypse.

Lunatics.

---

It starts to rain.

To pass the time, I start to sing “Why does it always rain on me?”

I feel like I’m going to have a mental breakdown.

I’m not sure if I can take anymore...

Every village I pass I stop in and ask the same questions; food, water, shelter, tarmac.

“Tomboco”.

It’s getting on... Despite it not being _terribly_ late on the clock, the heavy cloud has made it feel twilight-ish.

The day is slowly starting to wrap up.

I light up the GPS.

I’m still nowhere near where I need to be; not even close.

After a while the rain stops.

The rear tyre... It’s _gone_. I can _feel_ the sag.

Horror.

I twist around, and there it is, wallowing and flapping away under the weight.

No.

No I _can’t_...

In an instant, making it to Tomboco before dark has gone from unlikely to impossible.

My brain turns off. I become something mechanical. A robot.

A tyre changing robot.

I pull over the bike and go through the steps.

I’ve got the wheel off and onto the ground, lying flat.

It doesn’t matter how much I jump on the tyre wall, how much I dig my boot heels into it, the tyre is _glued_ to the rim. Without making space between the two, there’s nowhere to fit my tyre irons.

Without creating space I can do nothing...

Sweat’s flying everywhere as I stomp and jump and stomp.

It’s not working, so I stop.

Standing there, getting my breath back, sweat dripping off the nose, thirst biting in the back of my throat, I realise there’s nothing else I can do. No alternative.

Fucked at the first hurdle.

Guess I’ll keep stomping and jumping, then.

What else am I going to do?

My shirt's already saturated through, and that’s a problem. Maybe my biggest problem; I drank my last drop of water a fair while back... There's nothing left and there hasn't been for quite some time.

Maybe I should stop and wait? Avoid dehydrating myself further if the tyre's not going to unstick anyway?

But then, who's coming? There's zero traffic. _Zero._

_Why does it always have to be impossible?_

Despair comes hot on the heels of defeat...

I throw my toys, accept my fate.

I give it another jumping stomp.

The tyre and rim separate all at once and I nearly go arse over tit with the unexpected giving out of the tyre.

I'm not even happy about it.

Back to robot mode.

I change the tube with (relative) ease; the new tyre irons made from re-bar that I got gifted in the last puncture nightmare have saved me this time around.

Out comes the punctured tube, and with it comes a random big chunk of rubber. I'm not sure what that does...

In goes the battered and bruised, twice punctured and twice patched veteran tube of thirty thousand of the hardest kilometres.

_"God help me."_

I’m shitting my pants.

Just like the last time, the fat fucker is tricky to squeeze in between the rim and the tyre.

Just like the last time this is my only spare.

It all seems so familiar.

Except there’s even less traffic on this road, not to mention less daylight to play with, less water, less everything.

Angola really has pulled my pants down and caught me unawares...

I take time that I don't have, and gently get the tube in.

I lever the tyre back in with absolute care.

The moment of truth: I pump it up.

I pump it up as much as I dare, unscrew the valve and listen...

Nothing.

It’s holding air, I think...

I rub my ear along the whole length of tyre wall, wide-eyed, and I can’t hear a sound. It’s a good start.

Nothing else for it but to put it all together and cross the fingers that it continues to hold, not to mention praying that I don’t get another puncture, which would, well, I don’t want to think about another puncture with no spare tube or puncture kit out here...

I’m still committed to getting to Tomboco, no matter how far I have to ride in the dark on this hell road; I have no alternative.

Back on the Shrike.

---

My nerves are shot to pieces.

I’ve lost all confidence in the tyres and the tubes and I’m way beyond hypochondria. _Every_ time there’s a wiggle in the bike, or something just doesn’t "feel right", or that there’s a sound that is a little different, or that the bike bounced a little too _softly_ off that rock I’m _certain_ that the tyres are gone and that I’m fucked. _Doomed._

I’m having to pull over _constantly_ to satisfy my OCD and see how they’re doing.

The tyre change, despite being relatively straight forward, has still taken it’s time, and its toll.

I’m fucking exhausted.

My brain is going a bit fogged and demented with it all.

Everything turns into a dogged haze of just riding on and getting it done.

I have a quick look at the GPS.

Allegedly, I’ve done eighty since the start of the day. _Eighty._ In a _full_ day of riding.

According to the GPS, there’s still forty clicks to go to Tomboco.

I'm not even within cooee of jogging it out. Not today...

Forty is going to take me _at least_ a couple of hours, and well into the dark. Things are getting more gloomy by the minute...

The idea of the dark, riding in it, and - if I’m lucky - making it to an _unknown_ village at the finish line is scaring the shit out of me.

This bouncy rock hop is tricky enough when I _can_ see where I’m going in full light. In pitch black with a manic headlight it's going to be, well, _interesting_.

And even if the bike can handle it, I’m not sure how I’m going to. A week ago I couldn’t get out of bed without feeling like I’m going to die. And now this?

There are red flags everywhere.

But what else can I do?

---

Thirty clicks to go.

I’m so tuckered out.

Having to change the tyre tube _really_ took it out of me. The closer I get to Tomboco the further away it feels, the kilometres and time ahead seem to dilate and stretch the more knackered I get.

I've never felt so far away from Tomboco.

I’m so _thirsty_...

I think I’ve stopped sweating... Which, I don’t know, seems to be a bad thing right now; like I’ve just run out of the stuff.

I don’t know where my brain is finding the energy to think. But it’s mostly negative, and I can’t get away from it. It’s so defeatist, but my exhaustion and solitude is dominating my ability to keep a positive attitude, or even something close to neutral. It’s chewing me up.

_Something sounds weird..._ What is that...?

_The front tyre??_

Nah. Nah _don’t_...

There’s a weird noise coming from the front of the bike somewhere. Unusual. And the only thing out the front is that bloody tyre...

Shit no. Please _no_.

I snap my head around the handlebars to get a look. I can’t see well enough without risking binning it off a bad bounce.

For the umpteenth time I pull over to take a look.

The nobs of the tyre should be spread out like a well cut mango. But they’re squashing together just _a bit_ more than normal.

Oh fuck no. Jesus please no. _No no no..._

I vault off the bike and attack the wheel with my thumbs.

"_FUCK!_"

Puncture. Small one, early signs. But a puncture.

My brain dumps what it’s got left of the “oh fuck we’re fucked!” chemicals into the bloodstream for the last hurrah.

I’m ready to cry. Again.

Again, I can’t.

_Why is this happening?_ I’m supposed to be two hundred clicks further down the tarmac road by now!

My head’s a blinded mess from the adrenaline, I can’t think it out. I can't think out the scenarios.

It’s all just rubbish and the word “FUCK” on a loop...

I breathe. Try to push back the already rampant panic.

But the horse has bolted.

_How far back was that last village?_

Or do I ride on to the next one?

Ride on?

Tomboco?

Can I ride on and just pump it up when it needs it??

For an hour and a half? In the dark? _Are you retarded?_

_Water._ It cuts through the mess.

All that matters is getting water. The rest is, really, just details.

How far back was that last village??

Dunno.

Can’t be more than ten clicks... Maximum. Maybe?

I could head back to that last village and get someone to boil me up some of their water from the well, cross my fingers, and sleep on the floor of someone’s hut.

Suboptimal.

But I should make out.

What else?

Camp _here_?

There’s nowhere to do that. It’s all thick, tall, reedy, stiff grass out here. As high as my head. And no water.

What else...?

Errrrr. Nope. Nothing.

The last village then...

Fuck it. Let’s do that.

I’ll ride back as far as I can before I shred the tyre or the bike becomes unrideable, I’ll walk the rest.

With luck, I’ll get close enough to be able to walk my stuff.

Go.

I vault on and peel out.

The bike’s still managing to perform, the handling is still there, still enough. I ride as hard as I can, as fast as the bike will let me.

Reckless.

Fuck staying calm. Calm left off a _long_ way back...

I go dizzy, blurry.

I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

---

We made it.

Somehow...

It's weird. We _shouldn't_ have...

The local mob look at me oddly while I feverishly inspect the front tyre. I don’t think they expected me to be coming back.

The tyre’s _fine_. Seems to be holding up, no problem.

It shouldn’t be able to hold pressure like this... Punctured tyres go flat, fast.

_So what’s going on?_

Am I jumping at shadows?

So. If nothing’s changed... can I keep going?

_No_. In that moment I saw the flat tyre I let go of Tomboco. I can’t get it back.

Mentally, I can't. The full reality of the consequences of having a puncture – at this time of day, with no water – was fully brought home to me.

I’m _done_.

Cooked.

I try to strike up a conversation with the locals who have slowly formed up around the Shrike.

“Bonjour! Sa va?”

They all look back at me like I just farted.

There’s some confused muttering...

Oh! Portuguese! Right! _God damn it_. Can I catch a fucking break!?

Engage the brain.

“Uh, bom, uuuh, bom dia! Uh... com esta?”

“Bar bar bar bar bar bar bar bar...”

_Shit._

I can’t do this. I’m not nearly crisp enough for this.

“Uh... Saber, France-ay?”

“Neow”. _No._

_Shit._

Someone gives me the international hand sign for "one moment" and goes running off; hopefully they'll bring back someone who speaks French...

Charades for now.

I try to get across that the bike's fucked (not 100% true...) and that I need somewhere to sleep.

It takes a goddamn age; no one's picking up what I'm putting down.

The "one moment" person comes running back with a French speaker. Huzzah! I ask where I can stay the night and he say's we need to ask the village chief for permission.

That's a first...

---

We find the chief, sitting with some mates out the front of his hut. The French speaker goes in to bat on my behalf.

Big thumbs up from the chief. Excellent!

I figure from the chat and the gesturing that he wants me to stay with him and his family in his hut.

It's a really nice gesture. But I don't want to look like a dill because I'm putting up a mosquito net inside their house; there's something that seems wrong about that... But, by the same token, I also don't want to get eaten by mosquitoes and get malaria in the night - which would be just delightful out here. Either way, I'm in the shit.

I try to explain to the translator that that’s really super nice, and I’m very grateful and all, but I’ll be happy setting up the tent out the front of his hut.

The chief is unoffended and cool with it, thumbs up. Bonus.

Don't ask me why, but my desire to get my tent up overrides my crushing thirst. It makes no sense, but for some reason I can't move onto anything else before the tent is done.

I quickly get to work.

News spreads fast, and before long every kid in the village has shown up to watch me do my thing, and a fair few adults too. I don’t reckon they’d have ever seen anything of the likes of a tent before, or someone like me... so I make a bit of a song and dance of it.

The kids are simultaneously intrigued, fascinated and _terrified_ of me all at once. Whenever I get close they all go scattering off, _screaming_, freaking out. Slowly they come back to watch again.

I don't blame them for being scared, I’m exhausted and filthy, must look like hell...

In the process of putting up the tent I meet the chief’s son, who kind of speaks French and is around my age and seems like a nice guy, so he takes up the mantle of being my makeshift translator. The mob are curious so it turns into something of an AMA while I work.

I finish the job and quickly get onto the water question with my new friend.

The communication breaks down a bit as we reach the limit of our shared French, and in the end he gives me the international hand sign for "follow me".

We walk all the way to the other side of the village.

Tucked in behind a couple of other huts is the world’s smallest corner store...

It’s just a couple of dusty shelves with some weathered and bashed knick-knacks from western civilisation. The son-of-chief and the proprietor have a conversation in Portuguese, and, like magic, the boss pulls a carton of _six_ big, dusty, old bottles of water down from the top shelf.

Just like that - as I greedily slug down a whole bottle before I've even paid - the nightmare is in the books.

Water never tasted so good...

It's _done_.

Ancient history.

It’s going to be ok.

## Chapter Three

Everyone’s very welcoming here, _super_ nice; all smiles.

They seem genuinely happy to have me, and I’m thrilled to be here.

With a couple of bottles of water in the system I’m feeling much better than I was.

This is a million times better than being on the road; puncture or not...

Even though it was only an hour ago, it feels _insane_ that I was going to try to make Tomboco in the dark instead of just doing _this_ instead.

With my brain working again, my best bet for what made me think the front tyre was "punctured" is that by going through a puddle of water the tyre got cold and lost some pressure, making it appear to be a little deflated. In any case, there's no puncture as far as I can tell.

The sun sets, and the world quickly goes dark.

The chief invites me into the hut with the family and, I’m guessing, a few of his friends who want to keep talking. There are a handful of the men sitting at a round table and the women and kids are sitting on the hard mud floor. The whole room is barely lit at all by a single lamp in the corner, and we talk in the shadows.

We talk and talk and talk, with a poster of the president of Angola high on the mud wall, overlooking the chatter.

Every-now-and-again a kid walks in through the front “door” (an open hole in the wall of the mud hut) and passes out on the hard mud floor - passes out _cold_ - without a word, while the rest of us talk and laugh.

There’s a woman sitting on a crate close-by me. I think I’m falling in love with her.

She’s flat-out beautiful. _Stunning_.

Her open, easy-to-smile and quick-to-laugh face has _never_ seen makeup before. It’s beauty in its rawest form.

She has me absolutely gobsmacked.

I am falling in love...

Or I might be still on an endorphin high; I think I love _everyone_ in this room...

I have to focus to stay on conversation - which is mostly about football and my trip. _Everyone_ loves the Shrike.

They eat up my stories. Everyone’s been incredibly welcoming and so kind, it’s hospitality at its most genuine; they seem stoked to have me as their guest in their hut, which is surprising and delighting.

They invite me to stay for dinner. I’ve gotta be honest, I was hoping they’d ask. A candlelit dinner.

How romantic.

On the menu is fufu and mystery meat in mystery sauce.

Fufu - besides being a hilarious name - is a sort of a root or something which they pulverise with a big stick in a bowl, like they’re digging a hole for a fence post. They do this all bloody day till, finally, it’s somehow got the consistency of thick, uncooked bread dough.

The smell of the mystery meat and sauce is too much for me.

The first mouthful...

_Nirvana_. I stop chewing. I feel like I’m having a holy, out of body experience.

It might just be the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my life.

It’s _perfect_. It just feels so wholesome.

Just what I’ve needed.

I’m gushing with praise, I don't have enough French superlatives for this...

Another young lady sitting on the floor is absolutely _rapt_ with the compliments when son-of-chief translates for the group. She gets up and skips out of the front “door” and tells some unseen person outside the hut all about it, like I'm the bloke giving out Michelin stars.

We all talk for hours.

I think it might be my favourite night of the whole trip.

It feels like I’m with family, and I don’t know anyone’s name...

The smiling stunner wants to learn some English. She wants to learn how to say what I've been saying - _aujoudwee jay oon grand problem_ - in English.

Hearing her say “Today, I have, big problem!”, with a big smile on her face, and, yep, I’m in love...

I’m also a grub. Filthy and _sticky_ and just, well, _grubby_.

Late into the night and my eyes are starting to roll into the back of my head by themselves. I thank my hosts for the best night of my trip, and head to my tent.

Sticky and disgusting, I lie flat-backed on the hard packed mud floor.

That second “puncture” might be the best thing to ever happen to me...

I immediately conk.

## Chapter Four

_Loud noise_.

_Right in my ear_.

I bolt upright. Eyes wild. Adrenaline dumping.

Tent...

_Angola_.

Rooster?

_Fuck it._

Fuck you. Fucking rooster.

I unclench. Slowly.

Cocker-doodle-fuckin-doo.

The rest of the roosters in the tree next to the tent take up the chorus. I think they were all as surprised as I was... There must be a whole fucking flock of the bastards. It’s still near pitch in the middle of the chilly night. Christ knows what time, but it’s nowhere _near_ dawn.

I roll back down to sleep.

---

Loud noise.

"_Argh!_"

Damn that fucking retarded rooster!

This is the third time that bastard has woken me up.

The rest of the bastards are cutting sick with the premature chorus.

It's like they're doing it _right in my ear_.

_Jesus!_

I’m going to find that bastard and wring his neck...

---

Again...

Fucker.

This time, it’s a little lighter out.

Dawn. _Must be._

I lie still...

The roosters won’t stop.

Now it’s goats. Right outside my tent. Bleating like crazy.

Nature’s alarm clock.

There’s no staying asleep anymore.

My body’s in rigor mortis. It takes time to move even an inch.

Bleary eyed, I poke my head out of the tent.

The chief is sitting outside on a chair. I think he’s got the same problem as I do. Either that or he’s been waiting for me to get up for a chat.

"Ola..."

First things first though; I head to The Shrike.

The front tyre seems fine. So does the back, for that matter...

I give my second last banana to the chief, and we both have breakfast.

The chief watches me while I strike camp.

I go and take a shit over the back of the village in the bush somewhere.

We’re good to go...

I won’t lie, I’m nervous about today. Nervous about the last thirty clicks.

_Scared_.

I just want to throw the bike into the back of a truck or something and be a passenger.

I’m so tired of worrying.

But, I satisfy myself with saying that it doesn’t matter if it takes me the whole day; all that matters is that I make it the next thirty. That’s enough.

Take it easy.

I fire up as quietly as I can - which is fucking loud - and peel out.

---

As the kilometres and time tick by I feel like I’m on a treadmill. Tomboco seems to get further and further away.

All stretched again. Skewed. Fucked up.

I’m terrified.

So bloody scared.

Every second is an almost physical effort to suppress the panic. The closer I get, the more panicked I feel. It just keeps building up on me till it’s too much.

I can’t _focus_.

The breaks have to come more and more often.

In the end I’m breaking every few kilometres to take a walk and compose myself.

To try to calm down.

To check the tyres.

It’s a tiny, infinite nightmare.

---

Till it’s not...

_There_ it is...

Tarmac.

Blacktop. Assfalto.

Return of the ‘mac.

Euphoria. Pure elation.

I’m overwhelmed. Overcome.

It’s _over_.

I take a moment or two at my “border”. I walk about for a bit and I soak it all up.

I get back on the Shrike and we cross the threshold.

Unbidden, I find myself screaming in my helmet.

_Roaring_.

Over and over again with _all_ the air in my lungs.

Like an animal.

I don’t know how many times, or for how long...

But I let it all out.

I roar into the helmet till I'm hoarse.

And then I roar some more.

I tell it to the trees.

It's _done._

## Chapter Five

Straight, good tarmac.

We’re flying. It feels great.

So _easy_.

There are forests of baobab trees. Or is it boab? Anyway, they're everywhere. They have to be the ugliest trees in all the world. Pear shaped. Leafless. Ghostly white. If you like boabaobab trees then you'll like Angola.

Now that there’s nothing to be worried about anymore, I find _new_ things to stress over.

_There’s always something._

I’m worried that my battered, smashed, worn-down-to-the-canvas tyres are going to give up the ghost and shred themselves to pieces on the tarmac.

It wouldn’t surprise me; they really do look like they’ve been through hell.

The road has taken me west all the way to the coast, and now I'm heading south to the capital, Luanda. There’s so much mileage to cover, and with only four dayss of my visa left to make it to the border, it feels like I’m playing a dangerous game of catch-up.

---

Sunset and twilight on the outskirts of Luanda, and I have to stop.

It's late, again. I’ve exhausted myself, again.

I’m bonking out.

I take a room, the only option I can find. It's frighteningly expensive but at least it it has a shower and a clean bed, which, after the last few days, feels like utter luxury.

Once I've recovered some energy I sit down and do the math, but it's only telling me what I already know: I won't make it to the border; it's simply a bridge too far. So, the next challenge becomes somehow extending my transit visa. But today is Friday, which means anything bureaucratic will be closed tomorrow and the next day, which means I've shot my powder for nothing...

_Fuck._

Do I wait around here in Luanda till Monday? My visa expires on Monday... Then what? What if they reject me? What then?

Then I’ll be in deep shit. _Really_ deep shit.

I’m going to have to crack on.

But not with these tyres... They won't survive high speed tarmac. No way, José.

Well. Fuck it all. I’m going for a shower and a sleep. In a _bed_.

I’m fucking disgusting.

---

Luanda.

Morning.

I've decided to just blow out the visa.

Fuck it.

Over the last couple of days I've put new boots on the Shrike. In the end I didn’t get anything like what I wanted; I’ve got a road tyre on the front, and a knobbly offroad tyre on the back.

The poor fucker looks confused.

All and sundry have told me that all the roads south of here are all good tarmac, that I won't need offroad tyres. But I’ve been told that before... And I got my pants pulled down.

The idea of getting reamed, _again_, by an unexpected offroad clusterfuck has got me agitated. The idea of getting stuck out there with a slippery road tyre on the front and some shitty Chinese piece of shit tyre on the back has got me having kittens.

But that’s all that they’ve got. That’s all that _anyone’s_ got.

It took another day and night burnt that I couldn’t afford; three days of my five day visa are already in the can, and that’s to Luanda... _And that ain’t shit_.

Getting to the border in two day’s just ain’t gonna happen.

Not on an Enfield.

In the context of five days, and an Enfield, the distances required are enormous.

From what I can tell from the maps, there’s not a whole lot of anything between towns, and the distances between them are, well, it’ll take me a full day to get from one to another.

Even on good roads.

There are villages, of course, but not villages where they have anything they can sell you, or anywhere you can sleep. If what I’ve seen so far is anything to go by then there’s practically zero commerce; no business. For my purposes, they might as well not even be there; I’ve got to make it from one town to the next.

Angola, top to bottom, you’re looking at a distance about the same as London to Madrid, or, for the yanks, Minneapolis to Dallas, or for the Aussies, from the edges to about half way in.

It wouldn't be much of a drama on a road hog, sure, but on a machine that averages a _net_ speed of somewhere around fifty clicks an hour, you’re looking at a shitload of hours.

The visa’s gonna get blown. Big time. And I don’t know what that means, or what to do about it.

---

Out of Luanda and onto the coast road.

It's _sensational_.

Big cliffs edging into an angry looking ocean.

The smell of salt is in my nose.

It's my kind of ride.

Since leaving the dirt road behind I’ve traded one hazard for another: I’m too slow.

_Way_ too slow.

The traffic is sparse, but what traffic there is all seems to want to kill me. The speed limit here is 120 clicks, but that only seems to be a recommendation... I know that by maxing out the Shrike at eighty I'm well under the limit, but everyone else is a long, _long_ way over it.

I wonder if it’s some sort of game they’re having, to see how close they can get to me as they go whipping past, buffeting me with the air pressure built up by all that speed.

Anyway, I try not to let the near-death experiences get in the way of a good time.

The sun’s out but somehow the air’s managing to remain crisp and cool, something I haven’t felt in what feels like a very long time.

It’s almost _chilly_.

I can ride with my leather jacket zipped to the neck for the first time in, well, _this side of the Sahara_.

---

The trees thin out and then disappear altogether.

Things turn a little arid. Looking left, it looks like I'm on some sort of high altitude plateau, even though I'm not. In a word: _Sparse_.

---

The road tears itself away from the coast and the scenery gets lumpy and a little stranger, like it doesn’t know what it wants to be; stuck between grass and sand.

The hilly blacktop allows me to do something I don’t often get the chance to do; listen to how the bike is rolling without the engine on. I figure I can listen out for what’s going on with the wheels and tyres and chains and brakes and whatever without the engine and exhaust drowning it all out.

So, at the crest of a hill I find neutral and let the momentum take us over the top and we start to coast and gather speed into the long descent.

I turn the key off.

It’s weird. So quiet.

Just the wind whirling around the helmet and the light tyre noise from where the rubber meets the road.

It’s all quite peaceful.

Everything sounds just like it should.

I wonder if this is what a tour on a bicycle would feel like...

It'd be nice.

I lightly move onto the brakes at the bottom of the hill. The brake pads are a bit whirry sounding, but they work.

I stomp on the gears with a crunch, and first gear slams into place.

_FUCK!!_

What the fuck did I do that for???

Pure, bloody, retarded habit. A reflex action from hundreds of times of bringing the bike to rest.

Utterly unconscious.

"IDIOT!!!"

The whole bike violently shudders.

The bike lurches, with the engine turning over dead once, twice, three times before I grab a fistful of everything; clutch, brakes, and slam my foot down on the rear brake.

The whole thing comes to a stuttering stop.

"Fucking MORON!!"

I vault off the bike and I don’t know what I should look at first. All that I could have just shredded to little metallic pieces is all _inside_ the bike somewhere.

So, I look where I always look; where the oil normally comes out from that ongoing leak that I've had since back in France.

I have to almost lie on my face to see it.

There’s a lot more oil than there ought to be.

_A lot_ more.

I grab a rag and wipe the oil away and a fresh gush of oil comes oozing out to replace it immediately.

Ohh shit.

You’re fucked.

I’m fucked.

I’ve fucked it, completely.

I’ve killed it.

I’ve murdered the bike because I’m a fucking idiot.

I’ve blown a seal. Must be. That’d explain the oil... I’ve blown it badly enough that The Shrike will bleed out. Quickly.

God only knows what’s happened inside that engine cover...

Fucking hell.

_What do I do now?_

How do I replace a seal out here? How do I even find the seal I need?

That’ll take _weeks_ to ship in.

My visa runs out _tomorrow_.

I was supposed to somehow extend it at the next town. That’s still another half a day's ride away.

I don’t have any oil to top up as I go. And I don’t have anywhere to buy any.

Jesus tap-dancing _Christ_.

Angola was supposed to be _easy_ for fuck’s sake.

Do I put in on a truck?

_What truck?_

Fucking hell, why the fuck did I even go near the gears?! Without the clutch even? What was I _thinking??_

What to do now then?

I guess there’s not really an option. Right? Keep going and see what happens...

The worst thing that can happen, I think, is that the oil sump leaks dry and then the engine parts don’t get oil and then the whole thing really, really dies. Which isn’t a whole lot worse than the current situation...

If I can find oil, I can replace it as I lose it. It might suck, but it might get me to the next town, if the leak rate isn't "haemorrhage".

I clean up the oil pool as best I can with my filthy rag and check the oil level on the sight glass, which is on the same engine case. It’s a bit more than halfway up. So long as I keep an eagle eye on that, it shouldn’t come to an oil-less death.

I jump on and hit the ignition with fingers crossed.

The Shrike starts.

Goes into gear as well.

I ride a few minutes up the road, pull over, turn it all off and recheck everything.

The flow seems to be pretty heavy. The oil sight is at halfway.

Rinse and repeat.

---

Every few minutes for the next _fifty_ clicks, I pull over and make a check.

It’s a slow grind. I’m right on edge. But, more and more, I reckon that it can’t be something serious, otherwise it wouldn’t have made it this far...

The saddlebags are a mess of oil. The shit's sprayed everywhere.

I check in at a lone petrol station. They should have oil, but they don't.

Nothing close to the spec that I need anyway. I don't know what the rules are for putting off-spec oil into a motorbike...

I head back to The Shrike and check the oil level before I head off again.

It’s empty...

Completely _empty_.

_Panic_.

I grab the bike and tilt it heavily over towards me, as far as I dare without risking it falling on top of me, to see just how far from the bottom of the sight glass the oil level was.

There's nothing. Even leaning over this far on the piss, not a drop of oil is on the sight glass.

It's bone dry...

I won't be able to replace the oil as fast as I'm losing it; it's bled a couple of litres in fifty clicks. There’s _a thousand_ clicks to the border.

Pure, bloody, panic.

I _have_ to repair it.

But I can’t.

A nightmare is brewing...

Angola wasn’t supposed to be like this.

_Fuck!_

---

I'm going to keep riding.

Like a fucking idiot.

I’m going to ride on.

I know I’m an idiot.

I know it.

But it’s what I’m doing.

Where are my keys?

I always keep them in my jacket pocket. _Always_.

_Where are they??_

I look all over the bike. Not there.

On the ground. Not there.

In the petrol station. Not there.

I look in the places I’ve already looked, I know they're not going to be there.

I’m ready to cry. I can feel it. All that shit and now I’ve lost my fucking keys. It’s just one thing after the other. I feel just like a kid who’s dead tired and knows they’re being absurd, but I want to cry anyway.

I can’t deal.

There’s nothing to do but keep looking.

I want to look inside my bags, but that’s retarded; I haven’t opened them.

_Where the fuck are they??_

I look everywhere - even the retarded places. I ask everyone at the servo if they’ve seen them.

Have they been _stolen_?

Nope; they’re in the bottom of the water bottle pocket of my saddlebags.

I don’t remember putting them there.

I’ve never _once_ put them there.

Being this wound up is making me do stupid shit.

This is _the pits_.

I’m a whimpering mess. I hit the ignition and ride on.

The last hurrah.

_Desperate_.

I can’t handle the idea of coming this far, being through so much, only for things to go so thoroughly balls up when it was supposed to be _easy_.

When it _is_ easy.

One moment of madness... One braindead move and now it's an ordeal.

---

We make it to the next petrol station down the road. I've no idea how.

A long ride - at least it felt that way...

I head into the shop and they’ve got bottled oil, but it’s a long way off spec for the bike.

Sub-optimal, and it might kill the Shrike anyway, but beggars can’t be choosers...

I head back to the bike and squat down to add all of the oil in.

The sight glass is black...

_What?_

I tilt my head down to look at it on the same level.

Half full.

Normal level.

_What the fuck?_ Where did all _that_ come from??

_"What’s going on here??"_

I’m so confused. One moment the bike’s on its last legs, the next, no problem.

Ride on, then?

I'm lost.

---

I pull into a village called Sumbe.

My head's a blur.

In places all throughout the town the side roads are completely flooded and impassable.

_Inundated_ is the word.

It doesn't seem like it's rained lately...

Suddenly, it’s like someone just farted in my open mouth. I shake my head in my helmet like someone’s just slapped me.

The unmistakable smell of _human_ shit. No doubt.

Flooding the streets.

Deeee-lightful.

Nothing like flooded sewers to say welcome to the town...

It'll still have to do for the day. I can't go on.

I'm into the guts of the place and, as usual, I’m spending as much time looking ahead as I am looking in my rear-view mirrors; safety first.

A ute comes up close behind me, _very_ close, pulls out to overtake, draws up halfway alongside, and then cuts back into my lane and drives right over the top of me, slamming me off the road.

I lose control of the bike, forced into the gutter and just about go flying over the steep verge, I just manage to get it level and bring it back without binning it, and I bounce back onto the road.

I’m screaming at the bastard. Fucking _furious_.

Cunt nearly wiped me out. _Should have_ wiped me out. How the fuck did that work in his head? I’d get it if _I_ was overtaking _him_, but _he_ pulled out to overtake _me_. Just a second ago!

_Moron!_

The pure... _negligence_!

He pulls to the side to stop and I do the same.

_I’m not sure what I’m going to do._

I don’t think I’ve ever been this angry in my life.

I whip my helmet off.

My jaw’s locked and all the hot fury’s gone cold.

I’ve never hit anyone in my life either. Not in anger...

He gets out of the car and takes one look at me and he looks about as sheepish as you can get.

I can’t understand a word of what he’s saying; Portuguese, of course.

I'm verbally hosing him down.

I know he can't get a word of what I’m saying, but I know that he’s sorry. It was an accident. But I'm too far gone.

I need to vent it all off.

Cathartic. This dumb fucker gets to be my verbal punching bag for what feels like a lifetime of pent up juice.

The poor little bastard’s petrified.

I’m still not satisfied.

I want to punch something. I don’t know. His car maybe...

But that’s enough.

I walk off steaming back towards the bike and wave him off.

The Shrike’s fine.

In a manner of speaking...

It’s been a day of abuse for the poor thing, and it’s already done so much.

The “crash bar’s”, which protect the bike have, surprise surprise, protected the bike.

It’s the other side to the one that got warped from that wanker reversing over it in Nigeria. With a good kicking to straighten things out they start to look like a match.

Get me a hotel. Stat. I need to lie down.

---

Six hours in the saddle is a few too many. I’m knackered and out of it when I head out of my room to go get a second lunch, which, if we’re honest, is more like first lunch.

The other attempted lunch on the road was “carne”, which, I’m guessing is where "chilli con carne" would come from, so I guess that it just means "meat". But to call it meat would be being kind. It was, literally, like chewing an old boot; didn’t matter how much teeth I put into it, I never got to the point of being ok with swallowing the bloody stuff. Unchewable.

About halfway into the plate my jaw wouldn’t work anymore. Aching, tight and buggered. So I ended up having to eat the rest of my fill with all the elegance of a seagull trying to swallow a chip.

Not pretty.

700 kwanza. Haggled. That’s north of seven bucks. _Madness_.

Anyway. For second lunch there are no options. Street food isn’t a thing here in Angola, and neither is normal food, for that matter.

After a fair bit of walking around town I settle for a place that’s selling pastries - of all things - and quaff a few of those.

Out of nowhere I almost black out.

I grab the table I’m standing near to straighten up.

My head’s all over the place as the world cartwheels.

My adrenaline gets jacked and my head fizzes like it's sherbet.

I shove what’s left of the doughnuts into my face and scurry off to the hotel room to lie flat.

---

So. I’m still sick.

Or am I just tired? Or is that all it is?

I don’t know. I’m sick of guessing at what’s making me sick.

_This day’s been too long._

I call it a day early, I skip dinner, and fall asleep under the mickey mouse printed sheets in my crappy hotel room that cost me 5,000 kwanza. North of 50 bucks and it has only a bucket to shower with...

_Outrageous._

I hate this place.

Angola’s going to be the death of me.

It’s chilly outside.

I miss _Africa_ Africa. This is bullshit.

Marathon. You have your preparation and planning, where you do whatever you can to make a good result. The gun goes off. You wonder just what the hell you've gotten yourself into. The many miles ahead seem daunting and intimidating and you're nervous as hell. You hit your rhythm, you enjoy yourself and you're comfortable. You get halfway and the finish line seems to be right there. It's easy. All thoughts go to the finish line and you want to accelerate. It's an illusion. A mirage. The finish line is still a massive distance away and the hardest yards are still ahead of you. The thought of the finish line and the focus on that and the belief that it's all already in the bag lead to the next stage - Things get tough. You should have been ready for it but you were too busy being excited about the finish line. This isn't easy. It hurts. It's scary. Despair, helplessness, self-pity and failure are all on the doorstep. Self-pity, isn't on the doorstep actually, it's all you can think of. Small things not going right are magnified out of their proper proportion and things are at risk of unravelling unless you take the reins and get control and get it done. That's where I'm at. I know what comes next in a marathon: The thought of the finish line goes from being "right there" to being an infinite distance away. Instead of mentally chewing the whole remaining distance to the finish line in one hit (which leads to a breakdown) you cut it up into pieces that you can manage and then you just chew. All you can do here is put one step in front of the other. It's brutally painful while it lasts, and time draws out like an asymptote. But, eventually it's over, and the feeling is bittersweet. Learn from your experience, stop thinking about Cape Town. Don't even think about Namibia. Keep your thoughts under control, ignore that oil leak (screaming quad muscle) and the wondering about your health (that crushing exhaustion) and get the job done. Let's make this a workman like performance. This is your chance to build your character to the next level. Let’s learn some things outside of the comfort zone while we're here, and build the man you can be. I haven't been for a run since Morocco, yet I'm still running marathons. This is my jam, this is my shtick, this is what I do. This is where I'm at my best. This is my element. I won’t be beaten.

## Chapter Six

Day five.

The last day of my valid visa. After this, I’m not allowed to be here.

I’m not sure what that means. Am I a fugitive?

I need to get an extension...

To add insult to injury, all this processed food I've been eating has given me the squirts.

In spite of the ever-present danger of completely ruining my day, I head the long walk to the “Imigração” to chance my arm.

---

Cue a long, long wait.

Finally I get an audience. And not a moment too soon; things are getting loose in the guts...

I get told that they can do it; they can get me an extension.

I fill out the papers and they tell me to go and make a 9,000 kwanza deposit (100 plus bucks) into _two_ different bank accounts and they'll stamp me in when that's done. Expensive, sure, but it's better than getting in deep shit later.

I ask how long the extension is for.

They don't know.

They check.

Then they change their mind; they can’t do extensions on “transit” visas. Impossible. Apparently.

They won’t bend the rules for me.

I plead.

They won't budge.

What a clusterfizzer.

They tell me to go to the border. _It’ll be fine_, they say. But I’m not cool with that; what border official worth his salt wouldn’t put me over the barrel for that? I should be so lucky if that’s all I cop, I can think of ways it could go _much_ worse. After that shit with the Liberians and sweating my whole way through that bloody country, I'm not willing to tempt fate again.

I nag. And nag, and nag, and nag.

I grind them out till I manage to convince one of the underlings to write me up what’s basically a “please excuse my son from Phys Ed class because...” note.

I’ll be buggered if I know what it says; it’s all in Portuguese.

But it’s missing a signature or a stamp, and that won’t do; I’ve learned on the way that people will bow to anything that looks official enough, and this won't pass muster.

The minion says he won’t do a stamp or signature; it might get him in the shit with the boss.

So I ask to see the boss...

---

Two hour wait.

Just staring at a fucking wall, sitting on a flight of stairs.

I'm going to shit _everywhere_.

I’m getting flashbacks of being stuck on that boat in Bissau when I nearly shat all over the joint. That plank of wood...

Finally, the boss will see me.

I head into his office and explain the situation as quickly as I can.

He's cool with it.

_Yipee._

I get a sheet of paper that’s looks the business, nice and official. Still got no idea what it says, but it’ll do. And if it works, it would have saved me a hundred bucks. If it doesn’t work, well, I don't care anymore.

I run, mostly from the knees down, back to the hotel.

_Whoosh._

---

I find a burger joint for dinner.

_Bowels be damned._

It’s weird. It’s wonderful. It’s awful.

On the surface, it seems odd to think of a burger as a downgrade from the normal fare, but it is. I’ve substituted mystery meat that is fresh with a high rate of turnover to mystery burger meat, which is, arguably, even more mysterious, and who-knows-how-old.

I don’t see anyone else eating this shit... Red flags.

---

Day six.

I feel like a criminal.

Like there’s some sort of manhunt underway for a dishevelled looking, scared white guy on a beaten-to-hell and ancient looking pair of wheels.

Runaway.

I’m not sure I can pull this off...

But, I’m buoyed by the fact that I’m pretty sure I can pull off today’s short ride. It’s the bridging gap-day that had to happen; my choices are to go the short two hundred clicks to a middling village, or go long, five hundred and fifty clicks the next town along, called Lubango. Piss on that.

My attitude to the world has taken a turn. My perspective's different.

I’ve zoomed out.

I've zoomed out _a lot._

I've landed on the attitude of “fuck it”.

_Fuck it._

I’ve been reading a bit too heavily on Marcus Aurelius lately, and summarised it all into those two eloquent words.

Fuck it: I don’t care if the bike dies today. I don’t need it. I don’t _need_ anything.

I don’t need _me_, even.

So what?

So what if whatever’s been fucking with me for these last two months decides to end the game and kill me? _So what?_

This “puny arena of humanity”, in all the immensity of time and space; when you zoom all the way out on both scales, where does that leave you?

How can I seriously be taking any of this seriously?

Shadows and dust. All of it. _Everything._

_Fuck it._

On the topic of fucking things; _Fuck Angola_.

It’s not my Africa; I want the real Africa back.

I officially don’t like it here.

I haven’t liked it for the last couple of days.

This is a different world.

It's all I’ve wanted, _all I’ve been hankering for_, and it’s all finally here. But, as soon as I’ve got it, I don’t want it any more. I’m John Dorian and this Africa is my Elliot Reid...

I’ve got pizza and burgers, but I don’t want that anymore. I’ve got tarmac, mind-blowingly, brain-destroyingly gun-barrel-straight, featureless tarmac. _All I wanted_.

I don’t want it anymore.

I wonder if everything in my life I’ve ever wanted has been like this. You want something so bad, and then it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.

Angola, the place I’ve worked _so hard_ to get into.

This place, it’s unrecognisable.

It doesn’t _fit._

All of my Africa - this side of the Sahara desert - has all been variations on a theme. Things change, but they all stay the same; It’s all _Africa_.

This is different.

It’s like a cheap imitation of cheap American shit to appease the zombie hoard of expats chasing a buck; they’re everywhere. Oil and diamonds will do that.

It makes me cringe.

It’s the culture shock that I wasn’t expecting. Not one bit. And it’s hard to adjust.

Everyone wants what they can’t have...

I’ve wanted it for months!!

I want _interesting derelictness_ back. I want _rough_ back. I want _grimy_ back.

And that's not even the half of the differences with real Africa; _everything’s_ changed.

The depth of green has been slowly fading out from the forests of Gabon and through the grasslands of the Congo’s till now, finally, everything’s turned yellow. Not cool, interesting yellow either.

Bland.

Martian.

A Marscape.

_There’s nothing to see;_ blank, boring landscapes as far as the eye can see.

The places are so thoroughly poor, in every way. So run down and derelict and just sad looking. The huts and houses, the same colour of the yellow limestone looking mountains, look like they’re grown there, rather than built there. They look like ant colonies, or a wasps nest.

There's no colour. No smiling.

The kwanza is _killing_ me. The currency here. My god. It’s going to do me in. Gone are the day’s I could get by on a daily spend of something between ten and twenty bucks. A bottle of water’s costing me _four_ bucks, for what used to cost two cents.

It’s a fucking outrage.

I blame the expats. It’s out of control.

Luanda, the capital, was gorgeous, modern, clean(ish), full of sky scrapers, it’s got a beautiful esplanade that falls right out onto a really nice beach. It’s cashed up and going places. There’s even an epic, massive, rocketship-like monument there that looks like a Soviet’s wet dream. It looks like something I’d build on Red Alert that would, I don’t know, electrocute Marines. It’s looks gratuitously expensive and artfully pointless.

All that money.

But the villages... _Jesus._ They’re the poorest I’ve seen so far on the way down.

The poorest by a fair margin, too.

These unlucky bastards look like they’re on subsistence living. Or worse. I’ve never seen such a sharp line drawn between the have's and the have-not’s.

Seriously: they've got fuck all.

Did I mention that it’s as cold as a witch’s tit? I’m freezing my plums off.

The sun is _blazing_ bright overhead, we’re not at high altitude, and yet I can’t feel my ring and pinkie fingers on the handlebars, they're in a state of constant numbness from lack of blood flow. They've stopped working properly.

Tomorrow I’m going to wear a jumper. Believe it!

A couple of days ago I was a dehydrated sweating mess, and now I'm so cold I can't feel my fucking fingers.

Where the fuck are we? Are we still in Africa? Could’ve fooled me...

I’m sick of this joint.

Except for the sprung mattresses. And the hot showers. And rooms that don’t look like they’ve been freshly fucked in.

I’ll keep those.

The oil leak is driving me mad, "fuck it" attitude or not...

I guess that even through the leak is making a mess of everything, spraying oil everywhere all over my bags and bike and even me, it’s low enough to be manageable with top ups - I think. It's a crapshoot trying to judge by the oil sight glass. It’s just so fluky.

## Chapter Seven

Into Benguela.

_Traffic lights..._

I find a guesthouse run by an American. Her name is Nancy, and she welcomes me like an old friend.

There are a group of kids glued to the Shrike as I take the shit off the bike for another day.

They jump at the chance to go for a little joyride. I throw them one at a time onto the pillion seat behind me and take off.

It’s the first time I’ve ridden the bike without a helmet and jacket on.

_This is living._

This is what riding bike’s was supposed to be about; There’s no helmet muffling the roar and thump of the machine doing its thing, no lid to stop the wind through my hair. It’s a feast for the senses. It’s _freedom_.

The kids are rapt with it. On the last lap I give the throttle plenty, and the bike misfires; it just skips a beat. I can feel it in a loss of power and hear the gap in the revs, and then it comes back on again, lurching onward like nothing happened.

_It’s never done that before..._

I reckon that’s enough horsing about.

I head into the guesthouse.

There’s a girl. She’s _blond_.

_Blond!_

It feels like I've never seen a blond person in my _life_.

What a novelty.

I introduce myself in a kind of “your white, I’m white, let’s be white together” kind of way.

She’s from Sweden. _Of course she is_. Swedish and stunning.

How cliché.

So stunning, in fact, that her name goes in one ear and out the other. I give myself an immediate mental kick in the arse - we’re five seconds in and I’ve already botched it.

She’s teaching English here, of all things.

She’s happy to chat.

Even moreso than the blondness, I'm being pulled in by the fact that for the first time in recent history I’m speaking English the way I would back home; not having to modify to make myself understood. It’s glorious. Conversation: So underrated.

It’s been a _long_ time.

---

It’s also been a long time between pizzas.

And cheese.

I quaff the cheesiest pizza in the world for dinner and, admittedly, it’s pretty friggin good.

---

Alarm. In a dark room. On a sprung mattress.

Thwack. _Shut up._

The last 24 hours have been full of “firsts for a long time”, and this one is the least pleasant by far: I don’t want to leave.

I really, really, _really_ don’t want to get on that bike. It’s repellent, like trying to push together the wrong ends of a magnet.

I want to stay another day at Nancy’s. It’s been too nice. I’m not ready to leave.

But it’s day _seven_ in Angola. And that’s enough; _I have no choice..._

I can feel how chilly the air is on the other side of the toasty sheets. _The whole room is freezing._

But every minute I stay in this warm bed is another minute later that I’ll arrive in Lubango.

It’s that simple.

There's a pile of tarmac to chew today.

I get up and get going.

---

It’s cold enough to be heavily foggy. And that’s damn cold.

Jackets and jumpers.

I roll out, heading south east. Inland.

After an hour my fingers and hands have stopped working, and I can’t feel any of my toes. It's fucking _freezing_.

At around mid-morning the fog decides that it’s at the right temperature to vaporise off, and it all clears in the blink of an eye. It's beautiful to see the sun shine through the clouds, through the mountains.

"GOOD MORNING!!"

I start singing Jesus of Suburbia by Green Day. Because I can.

All is good in the world.

The bike misfires. _Again._

I stop singing.

It cuts out and then cuts back in again, jerking me forward and then backwards.

Gives me the heebie jeebies.

What’s going on with the Shrike?

We’ve got a monster day today. _Don’t do this._

There’s no one out here... Despite the goodish tarmac, the traffic is as sparse as the arid landscape. I’m guessing we're on some sort of high plateau.

The folks who built this road look like they’ve designed the route with a ruler.

Dead straight.

I start to pull the bike over to soak up some sunshine like a lizard on a rock, and maybe get some blood flow back into the extremities.

On the rundown the Shrike just gently, slowly, inexorably dies off by itself till the engine cuts out.

Silence. Dead silence.

Cue panic.

That’s never happened before. _Ever._

I turn the key off. Then back on. It makes the normal pre-start hums and whirrs and I hit the ignition button.

Starter motor turns. Turns some more. Turning, turning, turning, still turning. No fire. Still turning round. I’m wiggling the throttle trying to catch the sweet spot.

Nothing but the rhythm of the starter.

It’s going to flood… Gonna flood, gonna flood, gonna flood…

Do I stop??

The Shrike splutters into life and then roars as it catches up to where I’ve got the throttle.

_"What the fuck is going on??"_

I leave it revving high till I think it’s done whatever it’s got to do to sort it’s shit out, and then gently roll off the throttle.

It winds down, never stopping where it normally happily idles, and just dies. Again.

My head’s a blur, clutching at straws. I _need_ an answer. I need a _why_.

I jump off and do all the usual checks on the bike. I rack my brains.

I’ve got nothing.

No clue.

But I know that it’s bad. The shit’s going to hit the fan. Soon.

Or now...

I get back into the saddle and try to bring the Shrike back to life.

I ride the starter motor and and it's turning over again but won't fire.

Fuck, it’s definitely flooding. I stay with it.

It coughs and putts and then weakly rolls and then roars to life.

I stomp first gear, drop the clutch and _go_.

---

I don’t stop.

My brain is turning it over faster than the wheels on the tarmac; the backfires, the dying, the oil, the gearbox; but I’m not getting anywhere with it. I’ve really got nothing but a bad vibe and panic. And it’s coming closer...

I have to make a conscious mental effort to stay on top of it, because I can feel that it’s all close to the edge of unravelling. Badly.

I've got practically nothing to worry about these days.

Relatively speaking, I ought to be carefree.

But there’s _always_ something.

It's pathetic.

Like worrying whether the tarmac will be excellent or just ok.

_What a joke._

Now worrying that the Enfield is going to randomly crap out on me for no rhyme or reason.

What is that as a thing to be worried about?

_Ridiculous._

I’d have thought that all this travelling would make me rise above the petty shit naturally, that I'd have some serious perspective when it comes to angst... But it's still a conscious effort to swat away the small stuff. Maybe it always will be.

But I can't stop it.

It feels harder than it’s ever been.

I’m not sure I’ve ever been more _fragile_. Brittle.

And I’m tired.

Tired of it all.

The day's moving on; I should eat. I pass many villages that look like they might have food. I ride right on by.

This happens _all the time_; unless food hits me in the face, I won’t eat it. It never happens and it's dumb and I know it.

---

So. Skipped lunch again.

Into the afternoon and I’m crapping out. Because of course I am.

Lethargy is coming on bad and I’m actually starting to feel hungry.

And I never feel hungry.

The brief window of warmth in the late-morning has gone back to chilly again.

I can’t focus on anything. Everything is tired from holding this same riding position for hours without break.

I have to stop.

I can’t not stop.

But I can’t stop either, because The Shrike might never start again...

But, I _can’t_ ride for six hours straight either. I can’t do it.

_Can’t._

I roll off the throttle and go down the gears. I hit first, pull the clutch, and hold my breath as we come to a stop.

The engine keeps rolling. Idling like there’s no drama.

_No problem._

I put it into Switzerland and it’s happy there. No worries.

I turn the key off – devil may care – I’ve gotta take a walk to get my head back on my knotted, aching shoulders.

I take my jacket off and my skin isn’t really sure if it’s cold or hot. It’s both and neither. There’s a definite shivering chill in the cold air, but at the same time the sun is radiating down, mercilessly bright and warm. It’s like standing in a fridge with an electric heater a few inches away from your face.

It’s confusing.

Hot in the sun, freezing in the shade. What a weird place.

I'm in a sort-of bowl, with the land gently sloping up all around me. I can see for miles and there's not a soul on the road in either direction, nor a building to be seen.

I walk in circles for a bit, then head back to the bike.

Here we go, the moment of truth.

It turns three times and then fires. Normal. Perfect.

_No worries._

What’s going on here? Has it just healed itself? Again?

Was this morning just some kind of abomination then?

Buggered if I know.

Off, then. Again.

---

The damage is done.

Trying to go in the saddle without a break or food has done me in.

The remaining distance and time stretch off to the infinite vanishing point that never seems to get closer. Minutes become small forevers.

Each handful of clicks feels like the first hundred did.

---

Eight-ish hours of scared, braindead riding, I cross the town limits of Lubango.

Knackered.

It’s properly cold now. All cold. Although there are no clouds in the sky, the pin-pointed, frosty sun is starting to feel every inch of its hundred million miles away.

I don’t like Lubango. It’s a hole. I don’t like the vibe of the place at all.

It’s very big and loud and busy. I’m surprised and jarred by the size and the traffic and the people. What are they all doing, all the way out here?

I don’t like it, especially because I can’t find any accommodation. Small villages are never a problem; there’s only a few options - if that, so you go there, haggle, and take a room. Easy. Middle and big villages are far, far more difficult. There’s always more variables, and the places to stay always seem to hide themselves in amongst the throng of people and enterprise.

Just like now.

I’m running on empty, slumped in the saddle.

I need a place. Quick.

---

I’ve found nothing but deal breakers and exhausting conversation. A mix of Portuguese, French and charades.

An hour of questions with nothing to show for it.

How do you tell someone without using language all the things I want to say?

Do you have a room available?

How much is it?

No that’s too much. It needs to be cheaper.

Can I see it?

Is there somewhere to keep my bike?

No?

Seriously?

Fuck this.

Do you know any other places in the neighbourhood?

Sorry? Where?

What’s it called again?

It's like pulling teeth, and I have to do it every time.

I’m in desperado mode as time ticks and it gets darker and colder, but everywhere I go I hit my same dealbreaker; I won’t keep the Shrike out on the road overnight. Never done it, never will.

But it’s looking like that’s the only way that I’m going to be able to lie down sometime soon.

And eat.

And that’s becoming more and more important by the minute...

Not to mention putting an end to these maddening conversations. They're turning me delirious.

Nah. That’s it. I give up.

I’m heading back to the least expensive place and keeping the bike out front.

I’ve had enough.

---

On the ride back I spot a joint that I didn’t spot before.

It’s seen better days, but I might as well try...

“The Conversation” ensues.

They have somewhere to keep the bike. That’ll do me.

It’ll be 6,500 kwanza. That’s north of seventy bucks. And that’s the haggled price.

Easily the worst value accommodation this side of London.

I don’t give a shit.

I unpack and collapse into the hovel.

---

The sun sets. It quickly gets cold.

_Seriously_ cold.

Frosty, fog-your-breath-in-the-air cold. And I’m _inside_, for Christ's sake.

Are we still in friggin Africa or what? I don't have anything for cold like this...

I head to the shower.

I stare at the taps. Protuguese strikes again... No "H" and "C" here.

I reckon “F’s” gonna be cold, like the “F for froid” in French, right? But then what’s “Q”?

I give "Q" a long go, but the water's still coming out _biting_ cold. So bloody cold it feels like it’s burning hot.

Gotta be "F" then...

I give it a run and it's just as fucking cold as the "Q".

I let it run for minutes.

Nothing...

I head out to the front desk and ask about it to a young bloke who’s pulled the night-shift.

Aaaaaand, nope, no hot water.

Seventy bucks a night in a freezing shithole and there's no hot water...

I fly right off the handle; the opposite of impressed.

Second time I’ve vented my spleen this bad in three days.

_I must be tense._

But fair enough too; this is fucking _bullshit._

Not here, not now, no way.

If it was cheap and nasty joint then fair enough, or if we were in _Africa_ Africa where it’s hotter than the sun, then fair enough too. But in this place, this shitty little hovel, which has cost me a bomb, in this freezing cold dive of a fucking town? It feels too much of an injustice to just let it go and turn the other cheek.

It’s not this poor bastard's fault though, and I don’t think he can cog much of what I’m driving at either. Fucking Portuguese. Pretty sure he's figured out that I’m well cheesed though.

So I take him back to the room and run the shower taps and then shrug at him, incredulously.

He gives me the international signal to “wait here”; he’s going to do something.

Well, thank fuck for that.

A minute later he comes back into the room holding a kettle.

I have to laugh. And I do.

A fucking _kettle._

Forget about it, mate. No problem.

What a shit end to a rough day.

I try to take a shower, but I can’t. I can’t will myself to do it. Doesn’t matter how gross I am or how much I need it. I’ve taken bucket showers in the Himalayas before, and that was pretty fucking cold, but this is beyond.

Trying to tell my shivering naked body to stand under those icy daggers is like trying to tell your leg not to kick when the doc whacks your knee with a hammer; the reaction to jerk away is pure reflex.

I hug myself and dance naked from foot to foot, psyching myself up and pep talking the inner monologue not to be a pussy.

Don’t think, just do!

Aaaaaand I wimp out.

Crawl into the thousand layers of dense, old and weathered bedsheets that look like they came from my Nan's place. I can feel with my feet that the bed's under sheet - the thing I'm lying on top of - is shorter than I am; My legs are on the matress.

I hate this place.

I settle in for a grubby sleep.

---

MmmzzzzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz……………zzzzzzzzZZZZzzzz…………ZZZZZ

Fucking parasitic bastard malaria fucker! Been keeping me awake the _whole night_.

I’m tucked tightly under the heavy blankets. My face is _freezing_.

I can hear it but I can’t see it, it’s too dark and the light is all the way over the other side of the room. It’s barely warm even under the sheets. I don’t even dare move even an inch for fear of letting in even the slightest breath of that sub-zero air under the sheets.

Going all the way across the room to turn the light on, and then standing in the middle of the room naked to hunt down a single mosquito? Yeah, not gonna happen.

So instead of exterminating the persistent bastard I’m going to keep letting it eat my face.

I hate this place.

## Chapter Eight

Sun's back.

It’s still early but that’s definitely light.

Day... eight.

I think it might even be colder now than during the night.

The bathroom’s flooded. The taps have been leaking straight out of the wall, and it looks like the drain won't drain.

I hate this place.

Easily the worst value place on the planet.

Anyway, today’s a big one.

Almost four hundred clicks.

Gotta get going.

---

The Shike’s not happy with the cold. Nor should it be.

But it starts.

I peel out of town.

Adios, to this utterly charmless pile of shit.

Heading out of town a fighter jet goes screaming low overhead as it takes off from some unseen airport. I don’t get how, with people living in these conditions, that having _fighter jets_ can be a priority for the government. But it’s still a fighter jet, low down, at full beans, so that’s fucking awesome.

I almost bin the Shrike while trying to keep my eye on the grey beast as it sharply banks and screams away over the mountains.

---

Out of the town the road straightens out. And goes super bland.

You couldn’t design a blander road.

The tarmac’s featureless (in a good way), there are two lanes, straight as an arrow, flat as a tack, with a line of nothing-trees as far away from the road as I can chuck a shotput. They artfully obscure any view that might have been there.

It’s the blandest road I’ve been on. _Ever._ Nullarbor-esque. Just absolutely nothing. Nothing to engage the brain. Not a single distraction.

A very, very lonely road.

Hardly any villages to speak of, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

There’s no traffic, except for the very occasional road-train; massive, long trucks flying along at a terrifying clip. They're passing me like I’m standing still. Blink and you’ll miss it.

The only thing of note is that donkeys are back; I haven’t seen one of those on this side of the Sahara desert. A surprisingly noble creature, the donkey; nothing ever fazes them and they just get the job done. Their return is a sign that we’re leaving the tropics behind.

---

Four hours of nothing and barely anything to report later and I make the conscious, smart and mature decision to break early and get some lunch.

Very out of character.

I manage to find a place with a big plate of rice and mystery meats, most of which isn’t even close to chewable, so it gets the seagull treatment again.

I’m proud of myself for having the discipline, for a change, to take a break and take care of myself instead of blindly racing on to nowhere.

Shooing the kids away from the bike and we’re off again.

---

The road is, somehow, even blander.

_No_ diversions.

It’s just me and the thump of the bike and nothing else.

It’s like a world of sensory-deprivation by way of sensory-sameness.

I’m glued to the speedo and the click counter.

Even that’s not changing.

I tell myself I can break in an hour; when I’ve done another eighty clicks.

The speedo ticks over, slower and slower. Grinding out.

A watched kettle never boils.

The break never comes...

And then it does.

_I shake it off._

That felt like _forever_.

I _really_ don’t want to get in the saddle for another eighty.

But I gotta do it.

---

I can feel my head crapping out. Everything’s gone to fog and mush. I can’t think clearly.

I start to sing.

_Les Miserables_, the musical. Of of all things.

From the top. "Look down...! Look down....!"

...

"Now bring me prisoner two four six oh one...! Your time is up and your parole's begun. You know what that means..."

"Yes, it means I’m freeee."

"No!"

Etcetera.

I know it all. Every word. I can hear every note from the orchestra in my head.

I get a little stuck in Valjean's Soliloquy, must be said...

My helmet is the opera. The Shrike’s keeping time.

Out here, there’s no critic other than myself, and I really go for it.

It helps.

The clock starts to tick again.

Finally something to focus on. Something else to think about. A distraction.

Just between you and me; I reckon I do a better Javert than Russel Crowe ever did...

Not that that’s saying much... In fact, that’s not really saying anything at all.

I go clean through to ABC Café. That’s a lot of singing. More than an hours worth.

I'm not a big fan of Marius, so I let it drop there.

Back to just The Shrike, this road, and Angola.

I feel the slip again.

Then I feel a tug at the left footpeg. Like the footpeg is the rod and I’ve got a fish giving me some bites. A random sort of feeling, like someone’s giving the underside of the pegs a little tap with a hammer every now and again.

It’s disconcerting.

"What _is_ that?"

It’s happened before back in Ghana, it weirded me out then, and then it went away, I guess.

It’s weirding me out again now.

Something in the gearbox? From stomping on the gear before? Oil?

_What is it?_

My head won’t let it go. Like a dog with a bone.

I try to start up Les Miserables from the top again but I can't stay focused. I’m too busy concentrating on the feeling through my foot like a blind man’s fingers on a strip of braille.

My ears pick up a tinging. A _definite_ tinging...

_Clanging_ now.

_"Fuck."_

---

I’ve been spending half my time looking at the road, the other half looking for the problem.

I’m measuring the clank and tink and tug against every variable that I can imagine. Searching, mentally reaching for the cause. Mechanical causes, which lead to mechanical outcomes. And it's nothing but nightmares.

I have to break. I can’t handle thinking and feeling and listening for it anymore. My head and senses are in overdrive, going into meltdown.

I pull over to walk it off.

It’s my only weapon for shaking it off. The only handle I have left to pull.

The goal for the day, Ondjiva, is still a couple of hundred clicks away...

I get back on the bike and go. The Shrike starts clanking right away.

I feel my throat constrict.

Oh shit.

The pinch at the back of the jaw. Then the tightness in the chest. The rising heat.

I can’t breathe.

I pull over again. Turn off the bike.

I’m dying. I’m dying or breaking or both.

Everything is overwhelmed, like a thick wave has me pinned under. I’ve gone in too deep, I’ve burned through myself, all my energy, all my resources. And now it’s killing me. I’m drowning.

_I can’t fucking breathe._

Each out breath gets stuck on the uptake, and for a long moment my lungs are wrung empty, and I can't breathe in again. Till my throat clears and I can suck oxygen again.

I feel like I'm breathing through a straw.

I take a walk. A very long walk.

My body slowly backs away from the cliff of tightness.

I can breathe a little.

But I can’t get on that bike again.

I _can't._

It’s _terrifying_ me.

I can't do _that_ again.

I don’t know if I can do these miles. I don’t think - even if nothing goes wrong - that I can go that far.

And if something, something catastrophic happens? No.

But I can't stop here.

There are no villages.

There’s _nothing_; the last three hours have felt like I’ve been on a landscape treadmill. Same same same _nothing_.

Can I wait here and put the Shrike on a one of these trucks? How would I stop a truck? How would I convince them to take us? How would I lift the Shrike over my head onto a truck? What if the trucks are full?

There’s nothing for it.

I can’t do this anymore. I can’t take it. It’s too much.

But what’s my other choice?

I wish I had a motorbike. A _big_ motorbike. A highway monster where we could smash the rest of this distance in no time. But I’m stuck with my Shrike. My clanking Shrike. It feels like I'm crawling. I just want it to be over.

If there was any way out that I could take, I’d take it. I wouldn’t even think twice; fuck the trip. The candle's been burning at both ends and now the game's over.

But there _is_ no choice. No other option.

I can still feel the fizz in the head and the shortness of my breath being squeezed out by the tight, balled up chest. But it's not getting any better.

_Get on with it._

I throw my leg over the bike, and like last night's cold shower I feel like recoiling away out of reflex.

As I ride, it slowly ebbs away. And a softness comes in to replace it. Everything goes soft and mushy. A beautiful feeling of non-terror. The body relaxes like I’ve taken a hit of deadening opiates.

Into oblivion.

---

I find my clanging culprit; it’s the Shrike's chain slapping around on things it shouldn’t be slapping around against.

And that’s not a bad thing; my head had far worse theories bouncing around in there.

That chain was tight as a snare drum only a couple of days ago...

Every time I go over crawling speed it starts clanging and slapping. So even though all I want to do is go faster and faster I slow thing's right down.

It’s like not moving at all.

And there’s still such a long way to go...

---

It all goes to hell again. I’m dying again.

Mind, body and soul all go haywire. I can’t _control_ anything.

I stop quickly, again. And walk it off, again.

I tinker with the chain. It's flappy.

_Can’t be long now till that's done..._

I don’t fix it; readjusting the back wheel to take up the slack would take a long time. I go again.

I just want this day to be over.

---

I have to stop again.

---

And again.

---

And again...

Over and over. Every time my head and body lose it, I have to stop.

I lose count of the number of times I have to stop to hold back whatever it is that’s killing me.

I just want to lie down. I want to lie flat. _I can’t ride anymore._

Each time I stop it gets harder. Each time it’s worse.

It feels like I’m making no progress between stops.

It’s getting more and more desperate.

_I_ am getting more and more desperate.

I can feel the tension ratcheting. I don't know what happens if it snaps...

The clinking and clanking gets worse and worse, and louder and louder. Even at low speed it’s still not happy.

_Something's gotta give._

---

I crawl into Ondjiva in twilight.

Eight hours.

And that’s Angola. It's _done._

With only fifty clicks to go to the border with Namibia, it’s almost in the books.

I’m calling it.

I do a flyby of the village and see nothing.

I pop the question to some locals and they point me in the right direction.

I find a place to stay. It’s outrageously expensive. But the Kwanza has become like monopoly money for me; it’s lost all of its meaning, so I'm making it rain.

Plus, breakfast is included.

---

The day washes off me in the shower. The tension, the worry, the fear.

I start to feel like myself again.

A little bit.

The last two days of grime and road grit goes with it down the drain.

## Chapter Nine

I adjust the chain tightness.

_Working feels good._

I re-discover that you can indeed do a chain tighten, as in Cameroon, without having to get the rear brake metal push rod thingy out of the way, which is a fiddly bitch of a thing. The last time I tightened the chain - I'm not sure where - I remember that this baffled me, and I ended up removing the rod completely.

The problem is the exhaust pipe. When it's warped over to the left against the brake lever it cramps you for space, and there’s just no room in there to fit a spanner. But if you kick the shit out of the exhaust pipe to make some space, you can fit the spanner in underneath the nut, and it's a piece of cake from there; loosen that “castle nut” which acts as a locknut, loosen the big nut under that one, which makes the whole lot “slideable”, slide the wheel backwards along the guides till the chain is under tension, and tighten it all back up again.

Voilà.

I notice that the swingarm, which the back wheel is attached to, wiggles ever so slightly from side to side if you give the wheel a push or a pull. It should be rock solid. It's disconcerting. Something to take care of at the next service.

As I work, I think.

It seems that after all of the uncertainties and all of the things that scare me have been swept away, new ones have come in to replace them; the Congo's are over, and I’ve reached a permanent state of good tarmac, and there are no more embassies. _Forever._ So the attention turns to whether the Enfield is going to make it or not.

And I'm not sure about that.

_There's still a very long way to ride..._

---

The “pensão” – the place I’m staying – has a weigh ‘n’ pay smorgasbord dinner. That’ll do me.

I’m serving a big fat plateful of whatever that is in the steaming metal box. I’ve earned it.

My mind turns to tomorrow. It’s a short day with a border crossing, but I don’t know how the visa situation’s going to go; whether or not that "declaração" I picked up a couple of days back is good enough to get me out of the shit, or what Customs are going to think of that Congo passavant that the guy at the _other_ end of the country just wrote over, signed and stamped.

Flakey.

I wonder how easy it’s going to be to get into Namibia without any paperwork for the bike or visa for me; I'm assuming I'll be let in just because I’ve got a British passport.

And then there’s not having a Carnet for the bike... Namibia and then South Africa are, I imagine, much more rigid with the rule book than proper Africa. I don’t know what I’ll do if they just flat-out tell me no...

I'm expecting the most interesting stories to come from Angola Immigration. Second place goes to Namibia Customs.

So many places where it could all go balls up.

Walking to the weighing counter with my dinner tray full of food and I _swoon_. Out of nowhere.

I lose my head off my shoulders. I lose my body. I lose control.

I nearly black out and ditch dinner.

My brain pumps in the fizzing adrenaline to keep me conscious, keep me from swan-diving on my face. I feel it drip down my head and spread. It does the job; I keep my feet.

I’m at the end of my tether.

I stumble to the counter. I weigh, I pay.

I’ve overdone it at 1,200 kwanza. I can’t do that math, but I know it’s a lot. I don’t care.

I get back to my seat and try to figure it out.

_What’s going on._

I can’t. It’s all the same questions with the same no-answers.

I’ve eaten well today. Well, maybe not _well_. But I’ve eaten something. So it's not that...

_What’s happening to me?_

---

Morning.

Border day.

It's freezing, again. Even under the good blanket I've spent the night feeling the chill.

I'm up at dawn, which is becoming something of a habit.

I quaff the free breakfast of an omelette and coffee.

I’m barely a step out of the restaurant door before it all turns south. Puddle in a hurry.

Surprise!

I sprint.

As fast as I dare.

_What was in that omelette??_

Not gonna make it...

I shoulder charge the door into my hotel room, nearly taking it off at the hinges. I make a lunge for the throne in the nick of time.

_A photo finish._

I’m not entirely sure I got “nothing but net”.

Out it comes like a bat out of hell. _Evil_ fucking thing.

All that “seagulled” mystery meat from yesterday’s lunch, the massive pile of weigh n pay, the omelette, well, that didn’t even touch the sides...

_I wish I chewed more._

Besides almost making an unholy mess, it’s not a big deal.

---

I dare not move any further than spitting distance from the toilet, but after an hour’s worth of trips to and from the throne, it’s a done thing. _Over with._

What used to knock my guts out for days and days at a time is now gone in sixty minutes.

This iron gut I’ve cultured - hard earned and hard worn - it’s handling food poisoning like a champ.

I’ve finally got myself - over the course of _months_ of dodgy food - to being _street food invincible_. _Nothing_ can touch me.

And all for what?

Today’s probably my last day of rough food. I might never see another plate of grisly African mystery meat and dodgy as fuck sauce for the rest of my life.

I'm retiring at the top of my game.

I load up the Shrike.

---

All talk of iron gut aside, this could be a little touch and go...

If I haven’t fully cleared the decks like I’m assuming, well, this could be disgusting.

Apparently I’m not the only one who’s crook today; the Shrike sounds like dog shit. Under brakes she’s backfiring, badly - The exhaust letting off deafening bangs like a gun going off.

Bad bad not good.

---

Where last night forty kilometres felt like an eternity, this morning it feels like a blink. We’ve hardly begun before we’re at the frontier.

It’s all relative, I guess...

The border is _massive._

There’s a huge building off to the side, like a giant sort of warehouse. I’ll be buggered if I know what it’s there for. Everything looks tidy and modern, well organised and efficient.

Given the situation, I was hoping for a bit of a disorganised shambles that would be easy to slip; organised and efficient might means _thorough_, and thorough means I’m thoroughly in the shit.

_I’m going to get my pants pulled down here._

I looked it up and apparently it’s one hundred and fifty clams a day for time overstayed on the visa. Clams being dollars, not kwanza...

One hundred and fifty multiplied by four days overstayed.

_It’s going to hurt..._

I'm ready to fight the good fight with my "declaração".

I’m gee’d up, I’m ready to go to war.

I wind-down The Shrike. All the backfiring ensures we get everyone's attention, and quickly draw a crowd.

I’m beset upon by the normal fixers and money changes and folks selling bananas or whatever.

As I unstraddle the Shrike, the hour of vibration has left me feeling a little, well, _loose_.

I can’t see any obvious toilets anywhere...

I leave the mob to ogle the Shrike and I head over into a small, neat demountable building which is labelled "imigração".

There's one well-dressed uniformed bloke sitting behind a well organised, clean desk.

I introduce myself with a big smile and apologise in Portuguese for my awful Portuguese. He asks me to take a seat.

I sit down and hand him my closed passport; I’ll be fucked if I’m going to hold his hand and show him where to fuck me, if he wants to get me, he’ll have to sleuth out the Angola entry stamp like Sherlock.

While he’s fingering through my passport I scan over the room. On the desk in front of me, next to the computer (yes! A computer!!) is one of those fancy passport scanners that you see at Immigration in normal airports.

_I’m so fucked._

Maybe I could distract him by shitting my pants?

I could totally do it. _Right now._

Spray on demand.

He starts typing into his fancy computer who knows what.

He asks me for my motorbikes rego number.

Not sure how that’s relevant to Immigration, but whatever.

He back and fourths for a bit, then grabs a big fat “chonk-chonk” stamp and smacks it onto one of the passport pages with a beautiful, glorious _thwack!_

Surprise!

Job done.

Not a word said about the visa or the overstay. Never even mentioned it. It’s anyone’s guess whether he noticed it or not...

_Jackpot_.

You fucking beauty.

Back out with the mob again, who are still ga-ga over the Shrike, and I try to follow up one win with another, bargaining hard to get my money changed to Namibian dollars for a decent rate.

Nope. They won’t budge on their exchange rate. Not an inch. And I get reamed on the exchange.

Whatever. I'm happy to have it done, and the fact I’m not nearly a _grand_ down the drain already is a massive win. Not having to even fight for it is another enormous win. Getting a good exchange on the clams would have been gravy.

Onto the bike again. It sounds fucking crook as a dog. It’s a wonder it’s running at all.

Customs are up ahead at an open gate that I can definitely buzz. If I don’t have to explain that dodgy Congo/Angola passavant, the more the good.

The officials don’t seem to be paying attention, so buzz it we shall.

But The Shrike won’t do subtle, backfiring like an old western gunfight, enough to wake the dead, and enough to wake the officials from their stupor.

They come running to stop me.

God _damn_ it.

Two blokes who look way too badass to be Customs pull me up. They look more like a SWAT team than boring border officials... Big bastards too.

They ask me for my Carnet. Straight up. _I'm fucked._

I don’t bother to explain that I don’t, and never have, had one - that can only make things more complicated. Instead I shake hands, apologise in Portuguese for my terrible Portuguese, and cough up the dodgy passavant.

They want to know what I’ve been up to on the bike. More interested than interrogatory... so we chat about that for a while. They hand me back the passavant, tell me to watch out for those thieving bastard Namibians, and, surprise! wish me good luck.

Fuck yeah!

Angola: Done.

Fucking _done_.

Adios, mofos!

I’m going to go buy a lotto ticket. This has been _too_ good.

We backfire our way over to the Namibian side of the post.

---

Immigration is a piece of cake: fill out a simple form, get a stamp, no visa, no questions.

And they speak English. _Hallelujah._

Welcome to Namibia.

I head to Customs - the last piece of the puzzle.

I have to dodge past another group of officials on the way, who look a lot like Customs, but aren’t Customs...

They wanted me to pay a _road tax_, which ain’t gonna happen... I tell them that the lady at Immigration told me that I had to see Customs first and they swallow that.

At the legit Customs there’s no one behind the perspex sheet, so I busy myself with reading the papers tacked onto it while I wait. Knowledge is power.

The first bit of paper says “TIP: Temporary Import Permit”. _I’m in the right place..._

Behind the Perspex it all looks pretty legit. Very formal, very organised. Not looking good for me then.

Once I’ve read all the papers, and run out of patience, I start “hallooooo”-ing through the hole in the bottom of the window.

Finally, someone comes to attend to me, she gives me papers to fill out while she goes and finds the boss.

Papers are pretty straightforward; the usual guff: Name, passport details, addresses...

A man who looks like a businessman shows up and slides the Perspex back a smidge.

“Carnet”

_Fuck._

I can go sycophantic or assertive...

Assertive.

“I don’t have one” I nearly spit it at him.

“No Carnet?”

“Nope, I don’t need one. Here, look at my passport, I’ve been to all these places with no carnet. Look. See? I don’t need one”

He says he needs to go and speak with his boss.

_It’s gonna go tits up._

After five he comes back to the window with an older version of himself.

“Where is your carnet??” The boss this time, accusing.

“I don’t have one. I don’t need one.”

“How did you make it to Namibia without a Carnet?”

I sound off on my fingers, “England, Scotland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, The other Congo, Angola, and, voila, Namibia. All without a carnet.”

It’s a hell of a list. All twenty seven of them.

It's overkill, and takes some saying, but it’s evidence enough, and it works a charm.

The boss gives it the nod, they whack a stamp on the papers I’ve just written on, which is a little weird. They tell me that _that’s_ my permit, and I can go.

Handshakes all round.

I’m in.

It’s over.

And I didn’t crap my pants. _Not once._

Welcome to the southern chunk of Africa.

## Chapter Ten

KFC.

First thing out of the border post and there’s a dirty great big KFC. As in, Kentucky Fried Fucking Chicken. I’m not sure whether to laugh or to cry.

This isn’t _Africa_ Africa anymore, we’re home...

Getting out of the post is busy. And then it’s a bloody _nightmare_. The cars and bikes are all over the road and they’re all cutting absolutely _sick_ at me. Horns and gesturing and just pure vitriol.

I won’t cop it.

I give as good as I get. Hand gestures and everything.

If this is what Namibia is going to be like, well, it’s going to kill me. Everyone’s driving me off the shoulder of the road, squeezing me out.

I’ve been around, I've been places, and I’ve never seen _anything_ like this...

Then it cogs: They drive on the left here.

_Dickhead._

Well, shit, _no one told me_.

No signs at the border or anything.

I'm back on the “right” side of the road, which is of course the left, and things calm down.

---

Re-wiring the brain is a headfuck in reverse, and even though I’ve spent my entire life on the left side of the road I still nearly get myself wiped out at every "T junction" I come to. I take the wrong line. _Every time._

Dangermouse.

---

Half hour of bland, long, straight tarmac takes me to a town called _Ondangwa_, and that’ll do me; they’ve got another KFC here.

It’s a weird village. There’s no people. _None._ But along with the KFC, they’ve got a massive and modern supermarket and even a mall. _A mall_.

I find the cheapest accommodation option available and shack up. At 200 Namibian Dollars, it’s pretty good value; big bed, hot shower, TV, AC, clean and tidy. Twenty bucks.

I’m just happy to be done with the bike.

Because I had the trots this morning I didn’t dare take even a sip of water on the ride; that would have been bad news.

I’m as dehydrated as a prune, so I guzzle my body weight in water.

My decision to avoid fluids on the ride is _immediately_ vindicated.

I should have sat on the toilet before taking a drink; it doesn’t touch the sides, it’s like my internals have just turned into hollow pipework with no bloody valves...

_Awful_.

The last couple of day's I've felt a cold coming on. So I’ve gotta hydrate somehow, but short of an IV drip I don’t know how to do that if everything’s going straight through.

Is that going to change the way I eat?

Shit no.

---

The local supermarket feels like it’s been helidropped straight in from western civilisation. If I squint, I could easily pretend I'm at home.

I buy a half litre of peach yoghurt and three bananas. I scoff that before I’ve even made it out the front doors.

Fuck I’ve missed yoghurt.

Refrigeration. _What luxury._

On the way home I buy a greasy box of chicken from KFC. Can’t not.

I jog home to atone for my sins.

## Chapter Eleven

I just didn't want to get on the bike today.

_Really_ didn't.

Lying in bed with nothing else to do, it hit me like a sense of dread. And so I didn't; I've decided to stay here for the day.

I’m not crapping through a straw anymore, so that’s a plus.

I try my best to kill the day by looking at rectangles, just like I used to.

I head to a nearby fancy hotel and they’re happy for me to hang out and use their internet so long as I buy something from the restaurant.

We’re all slaves to our blood chemistry, and I’m simply a better person after coffee.

Enthusiasm, energy, smiles for everyone, and pleasant conversation seems to flow out of me from almost the moment I’ve put the cup down.

After a few hours of rectangle time – video calling the family, generally loitering around online – I decide I can’t do it anymore. It’s starting to make me feel _greasy_. How I used to look at a rectangle for eight hours a day, five days days a week, two hundred and forty days a year is beyond me. What was normal back then just seems an impossibly long time to me now.

And, while we’re on it, why is it ok to spend 1,920 hours a year, at least, looking at a rectangle when you’re an adult, but when I was a kid (and it’s all I ever wanted to do...) I was told it wasn’t good for you - your eyes will go square - and I'd be forced to play outside.

How come no one ever forced me to go play outside once I grew up?

_What’s the difference?_

Why is that not only acceptable for an adult, but _expected_. Normal. _Successful_, even...

Beats me.

I've had enough of this. I head back to the hotel.

I work on the Shrike. The nuts that clamp the exhaust pipe onto the motor are only finger tight. Not even that, in fact. No wonder it was running like a dog. I turn it over and it sounds like it always used to. No backfiring. Happy days.

I watch soccer, which I don’t even like, from my bed.

Luxury.

Day successfully killed.

---

I don’t want to leave.

It's not really that I don't want to leave, I just don't want to ride.

It’s just a bad feeling.

But I’m in Namibia now - there’s nothing to be worried about. This isn't a scary country. I’m safe. It’s all going to work out.

I don't have a choice. It’s got to be done.

---

I leave Ondangwa early enough to make good time, but late enough that I don’t freeze my arse off (yeah, it’s still bitterly cold in the morning).

Tsumeb, the next potential stop, is two hundred and fifty clicks away. Which isn’t massive, but it’s not short either.

Very quickly it becomes obvious that this is going to be another boring, braindead ride. The roads are straight, there’s fuck all to look at. Just miles and hours of nothing.

Suboptimal. But it could be worse.

Easy miles.

This is what I wanted, right?

---

I’m checking the oil level every now and again. The oil fairies are stealing the oil again. Either that or it’s not going well...

I don’t care anymore.

But, as I draw closer to Tsumeb, I can feel a rising desperation.

I want this ride _done with_. I want the day _over._

I’m _dying_ for it to be over.

I keep going.

I feel my throat seize up like someone’s throttling me. Choking up. I pull over the bike and I’m ready to bawl my eyes out. Like a bitch. For absolutely no reason.

I walk it off.

The air is sharp, biting dry. And although it’s _not_ hot there’s a brutality to the sun bashing down on my helmetless face. It’s less of a feeling of heat and more like being invaded by radiation.

I get back on the bike.

I'm ok...

---

It gets worse and worse.

The length of time I can spend on the bike before having to get off and take a walk gets shorter and shorter, till I can’t even string together thirty clicks without having to take a break; the closer I get to the goal, the further away it feels.

This time a year ago I could _run_ that far without taking a break. It feels pathetic.

I'm getting woozy and the whole situation is just crap.

All of it is only a problem between my ears, I’m sure of it; the external situation is actually fine. The road is good, the bike is rolling, the weather is fine, the traffic is low, it's all easy miles, and only a short ride; it's _nothing_.

But I'm ready to snap.

It's insane and irrational.

After all of the hardships, after all of the difficult places that I've been to and through, after all the challenges that I've passed, and now I'm on the verge of a breakdown in Namibia.

_Seriously?_

It doesn't make any sense.

I'm trying to rationalise it somehow.

On the road, I try to change my attitude from defeatist over to nihilist.

Nihilism: Life is meaningless.

Stirring quotes on the utter meaninglessness of life in a random universe abound from Marcus Aurelius and Tim Minchin, and I get a _glimpse_ of the right attitude; small pockets where all the petty concerns melt away under the blowtorch of nihilism.

But then I sink back into the defeatist and just stay there.

I hate this.

I think it has less to do with the bike (we've been here before...) and more to do with my health.

Which isn't to say fitness, but my _health_.

Somethings wrong. That's clear.

And not being able to put a name on it is what concerns me the most...

I was hoping to hold off on seeing a quack till I got back home. But this country is westernised enough, which should mean that it has western medicine. I don’t think I can hold off any longer, it can't wait till I get home, or break...

Home, like Tsumeb, seems so close, yet impossibly out of reach.

---

Even the slowest train makes it to the station eventually.

I crawl into Tsumeb, feeling fucked up in the head.

There's a mall and a KFC here. Same same.

Surprisingly, my GPS has some options for "lodging" built into the map. Even more surprising; there are a few hostels about and even a “backpackers”.

We're definitely not it Kansas anymore.

After a couple of failed attempts at the hostels I head to the backpackers, which is a little further from the main drag than I'd usually like to stay.

The place, from the outside, looks modern and fantastic, with a nice garden and lots of lawn.

I can't get in through the big locked gate though, and ringing the bell and hollering through the grating is getting me nowhere.

So I sit on the floor and wait for someone to show up.

I inspect the backs of my hands. They're a raging rash. Red and inflamed and itching. I think it's the dryness.

---

A neighbour shows up. He's white, which still feels weird to me. He offers to call the owners for me.

They show up in a twinkling.

They're white too. White Namibians. It's _weird_.

They’re super friendly, happy to have me, and let me in.

The place is superb.

Absolutely spotless with brilliant facilities like hot showers and very comfortable dorm beds.

I'm the only one here.

_Perfect._ I'll take it.

---

While I’m unloading the Shrike a young British couple rocks up, after them a group of three German lads rock up in a campervan.

So many white people all in the one place.

What are they _doing_ here?

It feels so weird to see travellers.

I welcome them like old friends. It’s great to have distracting company, diverting my head space as we have a chat and share war-stories. I’m still finding it hard to focus on conversation; my brain just won’t work like it normally would. It’s all fuzzy and I can’t pay attention for longer than a few minutes without losing the thread. It’s hard work.

---

KFC for dinner.

Horrendous greasy delicious shit.

Something makes a noise over my shoulder as I'm tucking in, and I swivel around to see what it was. Too fast. And I nearly black out and fall to the floor with a lump of chicken in my hand.

I stick the landing. My heart is _racing._

My brain's a blur, my head boggles on the shoulders.

It all takes a few minutes to feel anything close to normal, like my body and brain are starting to behave again.

This is really getting too much.

Feeling the constant need to stave off a blackout is exhausting and terrifying.

I’m fucking sick of it.

I’m sitting, eating chicken for fucks sake, and with no rhyme or reason something craps out and I nearly pitch onto my fucking face.

What’s going wrong with me? Why is it _worse??_

Something I’ve been thinking about is that it’s some psychosomatic vicious cycle, where I'm stressed so I feel faint which stresses me out and makes me feel fainter etc...

But that doesn't make any _sense_. This is too _real_ a reaction for stress; too _physical_.

The other is that it's just simple anaemia; I haven't been eating any foods that are high in iron lately, I think... And the symptoms of anaemia - being light headed and unfocused - seem to match well.

I keep thinking that if I throw lots of different food at it the body will eventually get what it needs and come good, but that hasn't been happening...

---

I head the long scary walk back to the backpackers on egg shells.

I make it back.

One look in the mirror and I look like absolute shit.

I'm terribly pale.

My skin is flaky.

The creases of my nose are all dried up and flaking off.

My lips are chapped and the all skin around them is flaking away as well.

My arms are pale and sickly.

My eyes are tired and hollow.

It's all gone to hell.

The travelling beard, well, that's never looked good, but on the fucked up cake that is my face it’s the cherry on top.

I’ve aged. _Years_. Decades, maybe.

It could be the worst I've looked in my life.

Having my teeth knocked out in Barcelona is the other obvious contender, but back then I just looked like someone who’d been in a bar fight. Now, I look crook.

I can’t look at myself anymore. I’m going to bed.

---

So, I’ve decided to test the anaemia theory.

I’ve bought two steaks and a shitload of spinach. If anything’s gonna help, it’ll be that.

Steak for lunch and steak for dinner.

I _immediately_ feel better.

Too fast though. I reckon that’s just a big fat placebo; the body doesn’t make new red blood cells _that_ quick. I don’t think...

Other than eating steak, I’m bored.

There’s nothing to do, and I wouldn't want to do anything even if there was something to do.

I've decided that I'll stay here till I'm back up to feeling good again; It's a nice place, it's affordable at 120 Namibian clams a night (12 bucks), and there's no rush.

Plus, I've been told that this is the worst time of the year to go to Cape Town due to the weather, so why bolt to South Africa only to be drenched? Of course, if I didn't feel like shit I would be tearing to Cape Town as fast as the Shrike could take me.

Health comes first.

---

In the last two days I’ve eaten four steaks.

The only thing it’s changed is my farts. It’s like something _died_... I reckon I could kill a small animal with these farts.

Rotting guts aside, I’m probably alright to move on, keep riding, but I’ve decided to err on the side of caution and stay another day.

The young British couple have come back from an overnight trip at the national park. They’ve drowned their ute in a bog and fucked the motor. They've rented new wheels while they wait to see how badly they've murdered their other rental car.

It all sounds very expensive.

They’re pretty gutted about it.

They want to know what I’ve been up to. They’re surprised when I say “nothing”.

I have to explain that I’ve been feeling a little crook lately and that I want to get better before hitting the road. I add in, as a joke, “you’re not doctor’s, are you?”

They are. _Doctors_.

_Both of them._

I jokingly-but-not-really-jokingly ask them “any chance of a diagnosis? Ha-ha?”

Nothing doing. They’re obviously pretty sick of copping that from everyone they’ve ever known ever. Occupational hazard, I guess...

Fuck ‘em.

I could have really used someone telling me that I’m going to be ok, but I’m feeling better today anyway.

---

The British couple find out that their drowned car is basically fucked: water got in where water ain’t supposed to go. And now they’re in the shit.

Their itinerary demands that they crack on, but I daresay that having to do the rigmarole of sorting out a dead rental car that’s stranded in the middle of bumfuck nowhere is going to be a headache. Their plans are fucked.

I don’t feel that bad for them...

They peel off with their second rental, committed to the itinerary. I'm not sure if that's impressive or stupid.

So it's back to just me, again. Solo.

I head back to the dorms and keep chipping away at War and Peace.

My mind can’t help but drift; this book is too laborious not to.

I’m thinking of Cape Town.

Visualising how far away it is. How many days. How many riding days. How long those riding days are.

I wonder; will I lose my mind before then? Will my head make it in one piece?

I’m perfectly relaxed, lying in bed, but I can feel that drip of dread coming into my head, I feel the fizz, just under my skull.

Bang. Dump. Full blown, blind panic.

This is it. _This is the moment._

I’m going insane.

I jump out of bed. Terrified, _wild_, but there’s nowhere to run to; there’s nowhere, no _place_ I can go to escape, though the need to escape is _thick._ Palpable. Utterly urgent.

It’s all that matters.

I stride out to the lawn.

I can’t run from it, though I’m breathing like I’ve been sprinting.

Ragged.

I’m never going to be the same, never going to be ok, ever again.

I throw my shoes on and start walking.

Jaw, locked. Eyes, wild.

I’m losing it.

I walk in the direction of town. The pendulum swings to feeling fine.

100%.

Normal. ish... It swings all the way back and I _swoon_ on the spot. My legs are crushingly tired and weak. I can't lift my arms. I can barely hold myself upright.

Right on the point of a total breakdown.

I can’t resist it anymore. All that’s been going wrong, and now this, and there’s _nothing_ I can do.

Home is so far away.

What’s _wrong???_ Why am I going insane now? Everything, everything, is _fine!_

It makes no sense.

I always thought I was strong. Mentally strong. That’s how I’ve always thought of myself. But insanity has been right there. All the time.

I never knew how weak I was.

How close it was.

How easy that was.

Isolation. Is not good for me.

I’ve been able to handle it because things have been happening. Real things. Real problems. Keeping busy.

With no problems I’ve taken to inventing them.

For your first challenge: you’re insane now.

Good luck, with that.

The thing, _that blackout thing_, takes the chance to flog me while I’m down: The world spins and goes fuzzy and I nearly crumple...

But not quite.

I stumble into town. I don’t know what to do now that I’m here, so I walk back to the backpackers.

This blackout shit originates between the ears.

It sounds insane that my head is doing this, but I'm more and more convinced of it.

I'm the only one who can get it back under control.

_Me._

---

About three or maybe four time's today I've felt on the edge of it, just that _feeling_ of it, that it's coming, and I’ve had to haul myself back from the brink.

It scares the shit out of me. Every time.

The most bizarre thing is that I'm also a bit curious to see what would happen if I _did_ have a mental breakdown.

It's all very Percy Cerutty; He had a nervous breakdown, and though he was told it would kill him he emerged stronger from it, and from middle age turned himself into a great man.

Maybe I could do the same.

I want to get into a car, have someone drive me to the Namibian capital, Windhoek, then get on a plane and go home.

After all this distance, and all this time, and all of the challenges, I’m ready to throw in the towel.

I have to remember that I've felt like this many times before; Lome, way back in Togo, is the one that springs straight to mind; and Matadi in the Congo, another.

I made it through that, I'll make it through this.

Where is my nihilistic point of view? Where’s all this “life is meaningless” and all that cal.

It's _easy_ to be a nihilist when you’re winning.

It's when the chips are down that you have to earn your philosophy.

I've been disappointed so far with how I've handled it; I'm getting sucked into it, this bodily problem, this problem of the flesh.

I should be holding my mind aloof. What will be will be. Flow with the river. Go with it.

How puny, this human body in all the ocean of space and time. Why do I concern myself so heavily in it?

I feel like shit, and I'm scared, so what??

It's utterly out of keeping with my surroundings. This place is so tranquil and calm. It's the most civilised place that I've been to or stayed in for a long time.

There's no rush to be anywhere. I'm safe here.

Everything will be ok.

---

I’m up. Early.

Shit’s gonna change.

I need to snap myself out of this funk.

I put on my shoes, head out the front gate, and run.

First run since Morocco.

It shows.

I've fallen back all the way to square one. Maybe lower than that.

Running's like a game of snakes and ladders with no ladders.

I’m going slow. Real slow. And I’m still blowing up.

The slightest of inclines have me burning all over. Everything's screaming louder than it ever has to stop.

It feels good to push through and torture myself in a way that I know and understand.

Fuck me, I'm out of shape.

I can feel my arse jiggling, for fucks sake...

It’s a short jaunt, but it seems to be the thing I needed.

---

I spend the day reading War and Peace, snoozing, or staring blankly at a wall.

I don’t have any real _episodes_ for the rest of the day.

Sometime, I feel absolutely, 100% fine, and wonder what all the fuss is about.

It's a short-lived but beautiful window of clarity into how I used to work. Lucid. _There_.

I soon feel drained and not myself and on the verge of catastrophe again.

---

After a long, empty day, a group of four travellers arrives, plus a British couple. A different one.

They're chatty, and we talk about Namibia and other shit and the conversation just naturally goes.

It's nice.

The husband half of the British couple tells us a story about how he was bitten on the scrotum by a dog in a park and had to go get a rabies shot into his ballsack.

Fuck me. I haven't laughed like that in a _year_.

I give the laughter it's reins, and laugh till I feel like my ribs are going to crack and I'm going to vomit. Then I laugh some more.

It's the first time I've cried on this trip. I needed it.

Then one of the four travellers comes into the kitchen - he's a biologist – and he mentions what rabies does: eats the brain and stuff like that, then he mentions that tapeworm also eats the brain.

It hits a little too close to home...

I commit, right there and then, to go to the doctors tomorrow.

What if something’s actually eating my fucking brain?? Right now...

_Jesus!_

## Chapter Twelve

I wake up late at around 7.

The four travellers have disappeared in the night.

I have to push back a sense of fear and panic and dread about just waking up.

So irrational.

I head on a local’s directions to the Tsumeb doctor's clinic.

A consult’s gonna cost me $N400, which is 40 bucks.

Fine.

My heart is belting in my chest.

Here we go...

The clinic is pretty shonky, but there’s hints of western medicine about the place; diplomas and charts. Plus, the quack, a heavyset Namibian, is wearing a white lab coat.

_That’ll do._

I tell him what’s going on. I spill my guts; the nearly blacking out, dizziness, tiredness, all of it. That it’s been happening since all the way back in Nigeria. Maybe earlier...

The quack draws a blank.

_He's got no idea._

A shame. I was hoping he was going to be like “oh yeah, that’s XYZ’s disease, take this tablet and you’ll feel fine this afternoon”.

But, alas, no.

The doc takes my blood pressure.

It's 120 “over” 90.

The 120 is fine, apparently.

But the 90, that’s no good.

90 is the high limit where, any higher than that, and you have "hypertension".

And hypertension, apparently, is not good.

He's talking this up in a roundabout way as a cause for how I'm feeling, which I don't like.

Seems to me he's clutching at straws.

I think the hypertension is more likely a symptom of stress - because I’m seriously crook with something else - and I tell him that.

He agrees that that's a possibility.

He says that he could do some other tests like blood, urine and "stool" tests.

I’m all for it.

Let's run the gamut.

He tells me that, while we wait on results, he can give me medication so that I have a "very, very deep sleep".

I tell him that sleep isn't the problem and that I'm sleeping like a baby.

He starts ticking boxes on a blood test form for each of the tests that he wants to run.

He says that he doesn't want the costs to run up too high.

I tell him that money isn't an issue and to go nuts; give me whatever it is he thinks is necessary. So, he duly goes nuts, ticks everywhere, and I'm happy with it.

We're going the whole nine yards.

Let's get this fucker, one way or the other.

---

The "lab guy" takes my blood in maybe 5 different vials. The vials are slow to fill. The last two don’t fill at all, and only get a little splash of the red stuff.

The “lab guy” is wiggling around the needle under my skin, in and out of my vein, to try and find the sweet spot again.

Again and again and again. Jab, jab, jab…

Fucking... rookie... prick.... _fuck..._

He’s turning the crook of my elbow into minced meat.

I’d rather he cut off the end of my finger and milked it like a cow.

_Fuck’s sake._

I'm gonna whack him if he doesn't get it soon.

He gives up and says what he's got will be enough...

Nope, fuck that. I don’t care, just make it work!

He refuses. Seems he can’t be bothered.

He gives me a couple of tiny containers. It's time for the skill and agility test; pissing and crapping into jars.

Here we go...

Container number one is a breeze, it's cutting the flow _off_ halfway that’s the problem... But I manage it with panache.

Container number two is not so simple...

It's not like it's easy to just squeeze out a half-nug on command... And then there' the added technicality of some very tricky, very blind, hand-eye coordination, if there even is such a thing...

Working from dead-reckoning - fraught with risk.

Try getting just a smidgen of shit, the smallest of nuggets, into a jar the size of an espresso cup, without turning it into a horrorshow.

Good luck, with that.

Nothing left to do but to do it...

---

I'm proud of the result; only a _tiny_ chunk missed the target.

All things considered, pretty damn good.

I hand those lovely gifts - still warm - back to my mate, the lab guy.

You couldn't pay me a billion dollars to work in the medical industry.

Fuck that.

Anyway, they’ve got to send it all away to a proper lab in a different village, where someone who's probably trained for _years_ gets to pull my turd out of a jar, smear it on a slide, and look at it through a microscope. Why do people _want_ to do this job? Imagine how close their nose is when they're looking through the microscope. _It's not even their shit!_

Bugger that.

Apparently, they’ll have the results back, via email, tomorrow afternoon.

Namibian efficiency.

Impressive, especially given that tomorrow is a Saturday.

So, my thoughts prior to getting the results back?

I'm expecting it to show up _nothing_.

Maybe not a clean bill of health, given my shocking diet through a lot of Africa, plus my lack of exercise. But I don't think it will show up anything that's drastic that could cause me to feel like I do.

Best case scenario is that they _do_ show up something that can explain the issues that I'm having, and that it’s treatable. It would be wonderful to tie a bow on this awful feeling and then kick it in the arse and out the door forever.

But I'm not banking on it.

In the case that they come up with nothing, well, that won’t be so bad either. I will at least know that my bodily health is ok and that I'm not at risk of anything awful happening; I won't be dying soon. It will also tell me that the likely cause would be being stressed out. That’d be something I don't want to medicate for; I'll deal with it myself, just like I’ve been doing so far.

If that turns out to be the case, that it’s nothing to do with body and that it's all in the mind, well, that’s going to be pretty fucking terrifying, verging on unbelievable; that my body can be so heavily, tangibly effected by something as abstract as a state of mind.

This is the problem that I'm expecting to be confronted with tomorrow.

I'll deal with whatever comes.

I head home to wait, and kill another day.

---

I feel fucking brilliant.

Things feel clear, I feel _myself_. Everything is _normal_. Wonderfully, magnificently normal. I can think, I can move, just like I used to.

I could fucking tap-dance.

It’s a brief window, and before long I'm back again. Fogged. Scared. Like I can’t breathe properly.

The four backpackers come back to the hostel after their day trip to the national park.

Again, it's another glowing review.

_Tonnes_ of animals. Not the usual, boring suspects either. Not just herbivores. Cheetahs and lions and elephants. Crazy shit.

It sounds amazing.

It’s right there, a geographical stone’s throw away from the hostel, and I can’t do it.

Such a missed chance.

---

I’m half in and half out of sleep, dozing off.

I roll over and a throb of deep of pain comes from the back of my jaw. Right side.

One of my bottom wisdom teeth...

A _lot_ of pain...

_Fuck._

What now??

It’s always been a bit on the piss, that tooth, coming out on a bad angle.

My tongue starts the inspection. It’s like I’ve got a big marble glued next to my tooth. Badly swollen. Raging.

Hurts like hell anytime my tongue goes near it.

What the actual fuck happened??

I panic.

Getting a wisdom tooth extracted in a Namibian village isn't going to be fun...

I can think of nothing that would cause it...

Do I floss it? Brush it? A little bit? Or go hard? Or do nothing?

_Shit._

What do I do?

Maybe it's from some overzealous flossing?

An injury that’ll heal itself...? I go back to sleep.

---

I can't.

I get up, while everyone's asleep, and re-floss and re-brush my teeth, brushing that wisdom tooth furiously hard.

It _kills_. But as I go at it more and more it seems to reach a threshold of pain and gives up.

I head back to bed and pray.

_This is the last thing that I need..._

---

I wake up to a tender tooth. Still hurts but not so bad that it’s time to get the vodka and pliers out.

Hard to say whether I saved myself with the midnight floss and brush. Who knows.

I go and buy new running socks. I've only got one pair left after the other went missing.

My shoes are starting to stink.

I head to the doctor’s.

They’ve got nothing yet.

I wait.

---

I wait. For the whole day...

Simmering in fucking nerve juice.

Africa’s made me a pro at staring at walls, I can do it for hours, days, even - I’m the best person I know at staring at ceilings and other inanimate objects. But this wait is grinding me out pretty bad.

I inspect the backs of my hands. The rash has turned into a million tiny scabs that cover the backs of my hands. They're itchy and flaky and starting to come off to leave behind pink skin.

I reckon they’re going to make me wait till Monday...

---

_A clean bill of health._

Red blood cell count, haemoglobin count, white cell count, sugar count, kidney function: all in the normal range.

Theories: debunked.

Anaemia, diabetes, busted kidneys, cancer, HIV, AIDS - the whole shooting match - disproved.

_Shit._

The only bad note on the report card is my liver.

There are some high and low “flags” in the report with some of the "protein counts".

What about that??

It's not “good”, but according to the doctor it's not causing what ails me - it's nothing to be worried about.

I’m fine...

The Doc reckons that if the other liver metrics were off and not the ones I was having a problem with _then_ he would be concerned.

In other words, the liver is ok for the important stuff and letting down the team on the lesser things.

I tell him that I’ve eaten four big steaks in the last two days. I ask if he reckons that might have changed things and that my red blood cell count might have been no good before that?

He gives me a weird look.

This guy’s got no idea what I’ve been going through...

Apparently, red blood cell metrics take _months_ to move by a single point, and I’m a long way in the clear.

_I don't have anaemia._

He’s insisting that I’m healthy.

"No problem. You are healthy."

_Fuck._

I think...

I know I’m being irrational to wish that I was sick. I know that’s crazy, but I just don’t want to deal with what being healthy means.

I’m not dying; So I’m going insane.

Wait. Not so fast.

Stool!

_Where are those results?_

Apparently, the turds take time to “culture”. Which, other than sounding just delightful, could, _might_, reveal something.

It’s not over yet...

The doc will send me an email letting me know if I’ve got parasites in my colon.

_Thanks._

I go home to stew.

As I stare at the ceiling it’s all boiling around in my head.

So, the problem becomes more complex. More complicated.

The signs are pointing more and more to the stress and anxiety of the trip having an adverse impact on the body.

That’s a much more tricky customer to pin down.

I still can’t _believe_ that.

How tangible and real these impacts are; they feel as physically real as if someone whacked me in the nuts with the flat back of a shovel.

I’m _not_ imagining this.

I’m certain of that.

If “the mind” is creating this, all these physical responses, in so debilitating a fashion, completely out of my control, well, that would be as incredible as it is frightening.

A new backpacker comes in and interrupts my train of thought.

His name’s Chris. He’s from England. That’s enough common ground to get to talking.

Chris is dressed in khaki’s that have gone to tattered, ripped rags. They're obviously hard earned, and he’s obviously proud to be sporting them as the wearable passport of a windswept and interesting traveller.

He left England almost at exactly the same time I did.

Uncannily close departure dates.

At the crossroads of Africa he went east coast, I went west coast, only to meet up again in the South.

We share war-stories and I forget about my problems for a while. I love interesting characters like this who are good for a chat.

---

I wake up into consciousness and I don’t have to check my pulse, there's no need, my heart is _smashing_ away so heavy and fast in my chest, it's so violent that it's enough to wobble my whole body to its rhythm under the force.

I haven’t even moved a muscle. I’m supposed to be “at rest”.

This is my resting heart rate.

_What the fuck is going on??_

I don’t know what to do. I try to breathe calmly, which dampens things off, a bit, but it’s still hitting hard enough that I can count the beats.

I get up, throw my shoes on and head out for a run.

Again, it's pathetic.

A few kilometres at most.

I’m puffing and panting

Stitching up.

My arse is still jiggling.

My calves are tight as a tiger already; they're not strong enough to support the body, even at this shuffling pace, and they're complaining. Loudly.

I know that this is bad for my running. I’m putting the running "cart" before the strength "horse". I’m going to pull up sore. I’m going to break something.

But my mind needs this.

So I run.

I know that what I need right now, for my mind, is to completely exhaust myself physically; I know that it's those type of gut-busting, all out runs that leave me in a headspace that nothing really matters.

But, in my current state, going for a thirty click tear isn't going to happen. I just hope this is going to be enough.

## Chapter Thirteen

It’s time to leave.

I saddle up the Shrike.

Tearing myself away from this safe place, it's as hard as it's ever been. But there's no choice; no reason to stay.

I fire up and roll out of the backpackers.

Onto the main drag of Tsumeb and I can already feel that my sense of balance is off. I have to make constant, un-natural, machine like inputs of thinking and movement to keep the bike in a straight line.

I don’t think I’m going to make it to the next village... Not like this...

No turning back now. Just fucking do it.

---

There’s fuck all to see.

Just like always.

I'm trying to stay on top of my breathing and trying to keep my mind positive. It’s a constant effort.

The next village, _Otjiwarongo_, isn’t far. A touch under two hundred clicks. About three hours in the saddle.

I'm counting every minute, ticking every kilometre.

I continually calculate the ETA; the estimated time of arrival. Constantly dividing distance remaining by current speed.

It’s exhausting.

---

I ride into town, still ok, just before midday.

I stop to see if my GPS has accommodation options on it, like in Tsumeb. After looking for a few minutes, focused on the little GPS screen, I swoon. _Hard_. I nearly drop the Shrike.

_Fizzzzzzz..._

I was holding my breath. I'm not sure for how long. But enough to nearly black out.

I’m ok.

The moment I stop thinking about it I just stop breathing.

It’s fucking exhausting me, thinking about it every second of the day. It’s just not natural.

---

I get accommodation at the local church, in with the nuns.

$N180 a night.

18 bucks.

It’s ok.

No, actually, for that price, for a church, it’s pretty shit.

There are two beds - which is no good to me. I’m essentially paying double.

I’m all settled in and it’s just past midday, or something like that.

Now what..?

Otjiwarongo is hardly inspiring...

There’s nothing to do. It's a dead, halfway town.

I need distractions but this place is like being stuck in a sensory deprivation chamber.

Nothing to do but fill a lot of hours between lunch and dinner and bedtime.

I’m not _busy_ enough.

That could be part of what’s eating me.

A rectangle would be ideal right now. Any form of escapism.

Give me a fucking Idiot Box.

As it is, all I’ve got is a crappy, easy-reading novel.

Over the hours I read about half of it, then go for dinner.

---

I walk the dark village for an hour.

Nothing doing.

But that’s fine, because the town has a “Wimpies”, a shitty looking fast food joint.

I miss my street food...

I head to Wimpies and they’re fucking shut.

_Shut!?_

Bastards.

It’s only 7pm. What the fuck is going on??

Fucking _shithouse._

There’s no kitchen at the church so I can’t cook myself something.

I head to the local supermarket and buy a fucking awful looking, plastic wrapped, deep fried chicken, paired with an extremely questionable, cold frankfurt sausage and a buttered bread roll. Coming included with the meal is a tin of soft drink.

Not long ago an egg sandwich would have been a perfectly acceptable dinner. And now this seems super-duper suspect. Funny how quickly standards can change...

I eat the cold chook, pass on the sausage.

I need a shower.

Of course, it’s fucking cold.

Of-fucking-course.

I fucking hate this.

It must be near freezing outside. Literally. It’s fucking freezing and there’s no fucking hot water.

Fuck this.

I come out of the half-minute shower with pink skin. Shivering with violence. Swearing. Colourfully. In a church.

I’m going to hell...

---

I wake up on my back staring at the ceiling. Eyes wide.

Heart smashing in my chest. Like a hammer.

It feels like my heart’s going to _break_.

I hate this.

I hate this so much.

I have to cram down my rising panic that’s already out of control.

It’s light.

Another day.

It’s very early. I put on my shoes and go running.

It's outrageously cold. Seriously, _bitterly_ cold. Beyond cold. The sun is a blinding bright pin-prick in the late dawn of a cloudless blue sky, giving no warmth whatsoever. The whole world feels brittle and dry. Snap frozen.

I'm in a pair of shorts and a “breathable” singlet...

I cut the run very, very short; my nipples are threatening to make a break for it.

I take another shower of frozen-over hell and go through the motions, loading The Shrike like a robot.

I can’t control my heart. It won’t listen to me. It’s its own master.

Well, I’m leaving anyway.

I can’t stay here another day.

What would I do?

I fire up the Shrike. Bless it. It's never given me trouble despite the freezing temperatures and it's hard, short life.

I whack a dirty big strip of gaffer tape over my speedometer. Fuck you, ETA’s. I don’t wanna hear about it anymore.

I bid the nuns farewell, they don’t seem to like me much.

We peel off into the still freezing, crisp air.

## Chapter Fourteen

Out of the village and up to top gear cruising, village disappearing in the mirrors on another lonely, soulless road.

_CLUNK!!_

A single thump right through my foot pegs and up though my whole body.

A complete loss of power.

Nothing.

Nothing but the rev of the engine as it gently coasts.

We're rolling at cruising speed, but I've rolled off the throttle completely and there's no deceleration. No engine braking. The motor is just idling as we keep smoothly flying down the road...

Am I in neutral? False neutral?

I change up a gear and drop the clutch.

Nope.

Nothing. No power. Just revs.

I look down between my legs.

The chain is on an angle it shouldn’t be. Not moving. Still.

The chain’s finally given up.

Thank god.

_I’m not even mad;_ I can’t believe it’s made it this far.

Plus, it's decided to snap in just about as good a place as possible - within spitting distance of a village.

Even if I can’t fix it here on the roadside I can walk back to the village; I'm not stranded.

Really, for snapping a chain on what was going to be a four to five hour ride of nothingness, you can’t do much better than a few minutes in.

I surprise myself that I’m actually ok with this.

I'm even bordering on pleased; It's like the ratcheted tension has been snapped with the chain, and now I’ve got an interesting activity that I can sink my teeth into.

I kill the engine, and we coast to a stop under gentle braking.

I hop off, take a knee and hunch over, twisting my neck to get a look in there.

The incumbent chain has been jammed in by the front sprocket (the cog with teeth) at a really awkward angle. Doesn’t look good...

The chain must’ve snapped, but the engine and gears haven’t stopped spinning with all their power, till the chain got jammed...

Chances are good to likely that A) the chain won’t come out and/or B) it has gotten jammed against something (the THUNK!), can’t move, and then shredded the still spinning sprocket to hell.

Both of them are probably equally bad outcomes; to fix either of them I'll have to completely remove the engine cover, which I can't do out here because on the other side of the engine cover is the engine; swimming with oil.

Popping that thing off would be like opening the door of a front loader washing machine while it’s got a full load on.

Messy…

It’s a big job; I can't just do that on the roadside here, both because I wouldn't want to – it’d suck – and because I don't have the tools for it anyway.

I can only pray that I get that chain out, and it hasn’t fucked the sprocket teeth.

Only one way to find out...

The bags come off, the tools come out, time to get to work.

It’s messy in there anyway. _Really_ messy. Black oil everywhere that’s congealed with road trash to make a pasty black grease.

The jammed chain’s fiddly as hell and stuck hard. Greasy and slick. I can’t get any grip on it for force on it because the aforementioned fucking cover is in the road. I feel like I’m trying to do a wisdom tooth extraction with greased up chopsticks.

It’s jammed in good.

A thousand attempts of trying to get the pliers onto a chain link and slipping off, I finally get some purchase and squeeze like hell. Give it a little tug. It moves a little. Just enough to get a new purchase. I’m screwing my face up, for all that helps.

Link by link the snapped chain flops out.

I spin the sprocket, it has all of its teeth.

_Very_ happy with that.

Interestingly, the teeth of the sprocket aren’t “sharp”. Sprocket teeth go sharp and pointy when they're buggered - so I've been told - but these teeth have been worn down to a really shallow level.

I expected them to look like a peaking wave, rather than this rolling swell.

I don’t know where I've picked up the idea that when I change the chain I’m supposed to change the sprocket as well... But the idea’s bedded in there somewhere...

I’ll have to change the sprocket at the next stop in Windhoek, I reckon. Definitely can’t do it here; same engine cover problem...

Moving on.

To put the new chain on I've got to slide the whole rear wheel and axle forward towards the motor so that the two sprockets are close enough to fit the new, shorter chain. It works the same way as the chain tightening I did back in Angola, but instead I just slide the whole lot closer to the motor.

The crown nut loosens up nicely. Then the locking nut. No worries.

The big nut’s a tricky fucker.

The little metal rod that connects the brake pedal to the rear brake is in the way. And I can’t get my spanner onto the big nut from the underside, and there’s a bunch of things stopping me from getting at it properly from the top.

I _can_ get the spanner on it from the bottom, but I can’t turn the nut far enough around to get another bite of the cherry; the nut is all pointy bits from the viewpoint of the spanner; nothing flat.

It’s giving me the shits.

I try different angles, trying everything out.

I accidentally rest the back of my hand on the exhaust pipe, which is white-hot and melts my skin. Fucking _bastard_.

The backs of my hands were already a mess with those million, tiny, flaky scabs.

And now a big fuck-off burn.

Beautiful. _Delightful_.

I can't be fucked taking the rear brake off. It’s a fiddly fuckhead. I hate it, and I know that I'll burn myself on the exhaust again if I try.

I attack “the big nut” from the top, with the spanner not perfectly vertical because everything’s in the way. I know it’s a bad idea, I know it’s totally the wrong thing to do, I know it’s lazy, I know I should take my time and spend fifteen minutes taking the brake off instead of risking shredding the nut.

Nope.

I put the spanner on the nut as best I can and pull like hell.

If I shred it the nut might as well be welded on...

It shreds...

And in the same moment it lets go of the bolt.

Yes! Right! Done!

It all slides forward.

Spare chain time.

It's already lubed up coming out of the packet, like a big long metal snake.

I reckon I can get it onto the top of the sprocket ok, but if it doesn’t stick to the sprocket enough to loop back around out the bottom then I’m stuffed; my fingers aren’t long enough to reach that far under the engine case.

I’ll have to engineer some sort of fishing tool to hook it with.

That’s a problem for later though, right now I can’t even get the links onto the top of the sprocket. It’s so _fiddly_. And there’s so much chassis and frame in the way.

With more arse than class, I get it onto the top link. I don’t really know how I managed that...

I turn the sprocket slowly, link by link going on the teeth, and the links stick to the teeth just enough to get to my fingers reaching for them as they come back out the bottom.

_Easy_.

Thank god.

I’m filthy greasy; I can’t even see the burn anymore. My hands are just black and shiny.

Getting the chain onto the back sprocket’s a piece of cake, there's nothing in the way, no fiddling, just straight on.

Now to connect both ends together to make a loop.

There’s a special "split link" for that. It's basically a full link that comes in pieces, so that you can link up the chain with it.

Surprisingly simple (and weak looking) for something that puts up with so much constant force.

I’m comparing it with my other, dead chain. It doesn’t look right...

I’m missing two “O” rings; little rubber rings that go onto the two rods on the split pin. They're there to stop metal from contacting metal - which isn’t good for something that moves...

Where _are_ they??

I look all through the packet and all around on the floor. Nothing.

_Shit_.

Can I use the old ones? They don't look like they match the new chain...

I need an answer on this...

Is it a different kind of chain? Maybe?

The old, dead chain has “O” rings between all of the links. Every single one of them. Fresh chain has none.

So I’m OK...?

Maybe I ordered the wrong kind of chain?

Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve fucked up an order for parts…

Fuck it.

What else can I do?

If this is the wrong kind of chain and I destroy it I’m no worse than right now.

If the shit hits the fan again I can always hitchhike.

On goes the ringless split link and the holding clip snaps into place with squeeze from the pliers.

_Done_.

I slide the whole rear axle and all that’s connected to it back into place to pull the chain tight.

Gotta lock that into place.

I can’t tighten up that “big nut” as much as I would like for the same reasons that I couldn't loosen it.

I still can't be fucked loosening the rear brake to do a proper job... It's probably super-dooper unsafe - if that rear axle becomes unhinged... Well...

But, by my wet finger in the air, I reckon it’s tight enough to make it to Windhoek, where I’m going to have to take the whole thing apart anyway to change that sprocket.

I give back wheel a spin to test the handiwork.

Something weird's going on...

Despite the chain being good and tight, the links when they come in contact with the front sprocket sit up on the teeth and then pop down into place, hard.

Maybe it’s because I’m spinning from the wheel, and not the sprocket itself?

I turn the motor on, drop it in first and slowly let the clutch out while the bike is still on its stand. Everything’s spinning around and around and the links are still snapping in between the teeth.

Sounds bad. Looks bad.

I'll be fucked if I know why it's doing this; it doesn't make sense to me that it would be the worn down teeth on the old sprocket, if anything, worn down teeth would have the _opposite_ effect... Maybe the chain is slightly off spec? And what good is that to me? I can’t do jack about that.

Nup. I’m coming up with doughnuts.

The smart thing would be to ride back to the village and figure it out.

_"Fuck it."_

Everything goes back in the bags, covered in fucking grease. I toss the saddle bags back on the Shrike. Strap down the spare tyre on top of them, and then strap the tent on top of that.

_Keys..._

Where are my keys?

I had ‘em a second ago; I used them to lock up the Shrike’s built-in toolbox.

Pat-down. Nope.

Saddlebag’s pockets. Nope.

Ground? Nope. I think...

_You mindless fucking idiot._ Where have you put them?

Off comes everything, tossed back onto the roadside.

Mug.

Out come’s everything from the bags.

All my stuff, all of my clothes, out onto the road.

I've got too much stuff...

The keys are right at the bottom.

What was I _thinking_??

Pain in the fucking arse.

I load up. For the third time this morning.

Fire up.

Windhoek. The capital. Let’s go.

I sit on the fully loaded Shrike and hump it off the centre stand.

Under full load I check the chain tension.

It’s tight.

Way, _way_ too tight. There’s supposed to be a bit of slack - I should be able to lift the chain a smidgen with my fingers.

This thing’s ratcheted tighter than a banjo string.

I’ve cocked up my guess at the right setting for the rear axle, bigtime.

The pressure on the chain and sprockets, even just sitting here, must be enormous. It’s tight enough to be a tuning fork if I give it a flick.

I have to fix it.

It’s important.

I’ll have to take all the gear off and do 90% of what I just did, _again_.

I stomp into first and drop the clutch.

_“Fuck it! Just, fuck it!!”_

I'm out of here.

---

The new chain and the old sprocket, under the hypertension, and with that weird popping chain on the teeth thingo, should have torn the whole assembly apart. Worse than that, it could have easily fucked something important...

But it didn’t.

What did change is that the oil leak I’ve had since France went from being manageable to absolutely hosing out.

_Pissing_ out.

I saw some poor bastard driving too close behind me whack his windscreen wipers on.

_That_ bad.

Can’t imagine he was thrilled to find out that it wasn’t water being thinly sprayed in a mist over his entire vehicle...

In any case, we've made it.

I front up at a backpackers in Windhoek.

The Shrike still rolls, but it’s skunked half of its oil sump out its arse over the last four hours.

The saddlebags are a tar pit.

If that’s not enough of a problem, it’s started to weep oil out of one of the gaskets on the actual engine cylinder head.

Unrelated, but suboptimal nonetheless.

Truly, if any of these things turns into a serious problem I have no qualms about putting this bike on a truck.

No fucking qualms.

I’m done here.

Anyway. The ride to Windhoek wasn’t too bad. It's ok actually. It's got to be the first ride in a very long time that has felt like the time has gone by without me being conscious of it every single second.

It was a welcome relief.

That gaffer tape over the speedo was a deadset masterstroke, I reckon.

I must’ve looked down - only to see a strip of duct tape - a thousand times in the space of half a day. It's incredible how often I unconsciously glance down at that speedo like some OCD tick.

I still had to keep on top of my breathing every now and again. But I think I've got the hang of it; when I realise that I'm not quite right I take big long slow breaths - like a freediving breathing technique - holding my breath at the top of a lungful for a half second, just like I would do in the water, and then letting it all out in a way that makes the muscles melt. It has the double effect of getting the oxygen in if I have been holding my breath, and just calming me down if I haven't been.

Anyway. We’re here now.

Post-Shrike-inspection I head to the front desk.

Fully booked tonight.

Bummer.

There's a guy running around trying to find his camera so he can take a photo of the Shrike.

He's wetting himself with excitement.

We get to talking and, apparently, he’s a bit of a Royal Enfield enthusiast. A rare breed in these parts...

He’s taking shots of the Shrike, and he’s asking me how long I’m staying.

I say none, they’re fully booked tonight.

He’s the owner.

Suddenly, there's tonnes of beds available in the hostel. _Take your pick._

I book in for a week and at 120 Namibian dollars a night - twelve bucks - with the 7th night free, that's good value.

The bed is clean, there are lockers, and the room has its own bathroom. The bathroom's clean.

There's free interwebs and there's a big screen that’s playing sport. The cricket’s on.

I'm happy with it.

Good place to shack up for a week and get spares shipped in. A good place for a pit stop.

---

Time. To. Wander.

Windhoek is a nice place. I like it.

It's a short walk from the backpackers to town, and the town wouldn't be out of place in Australia; baby skyscrapers and shopping malls and that sort of thing.

Very western; it all feels familiar.

---

Back to the hostel after dinner and I'm winding down.

On a _couch_.

No Shrike. For a whole _week_.

Just like in Tsumeb, I need this break. Even though it's only been two days of riding since then, I still need it.

More the point, I need to be _occupied_. Busy. Hopefully Windhoek will have that for me.

Even if that’s just conversation, in English, with travellers.

Most of the occupants here are teenagers on school trips from the First World.

Too much of that.

They’re all drop-in’s. They've _flown_ here.

I've only met one tourist my age, and there are no "overlanders".

But the good thing is that there always seems to be someone around.

I don't feel so alone anymore.

It's such a novel thing to be talking with people about anything other than just small talk. Such a simple thing, but it feels amazing. I feel _me_. I can talk about _anything_ and be understood.

A group of kids ask what I’m doing here and I tell them I rode a motorbike here.

From there the conversation goes as standard, but the disbelief of these kids is a whole other order of magnitude beyond that of any African I’ve talked to on the journey.

They literally can’t believe it. Won't believe it.

They think I'm full of shit.

Before long the group of three has turned into a group of fifteen, and I’m leading the boisterous mob out into the courtyard like the Pied Piper.

I whip off the cat-piss-stained bike cover with a flourish.

Now they _really_ can’t believe it.

But there it is, written all over the filthy, battered Shrike - even down to the black puddle on the floor, like a puppy that’s wet itself.

Absolutely clapped out.

I don’t think it’s ever looked better. Not in my eyes.

Through the eyes of the kids I see again the whole trip as I used to see it, before it became mundane: The biggest adventure that’s possible on this side of the stars.

---

Everyone here is speaking in clickedy-clacks.

It's the first time in Africa I’ve heard one of these iconic tongue clickey languages.

It’s kind of awesome.

It’s about all that I can say that’s positive right now.

I can’t write.

Can’t write anything.

Every time I try I feel like I’m probing something dangerous.

Poking where I shouldn't.

It feels like I’m on the cusp of something.

On the edge of a bad discovery.

About to awaken something that I’d rather leave where it is.

Or ignore it altogether and hope it goes away.

I needs therapy...

---

I can feel it.

I feel mentally vulnerable.

It’s been two _weeks_ here in Windhoek.

For the whole time all I’ve wanted to do was load the bike up on the back of a truck to South Africa. I just want to have it done with. If someone had of showed up at the backpackers in a ute who was going to Cape Town I would have been all over it like a rash.

I’m ready to quit.

So close to the finish line and I’d throw in the towel with nothing short of relish.

I’ve been waiting on spares to arrive from South Africa so I can give the Shrike a service.

I can’t move in the meantime.

Stuck.

Essentially I’ve been doing anything braindead to kill time.

Sleep is good. I sleep a lot, and easily.

Watching sport is good too.

Anything that doesn’t engage the brain is fine.

It’s why I can’t write right now without... Fuck. Without feeling fucking _awful_.

Truly fucking awful.

Like I’m very, very suddenly, very, very sick.

I feel like there’s an insanity right there. It’s right _there_.

In me.

_Way_ too close for comfort. I don’t want to do anything to rock the boat.

I’ve stopped writing home. I’ve gone out of contact with everyone except those who I have to let know that I'm still alive.

A few days ago here at the hostel I was talking to a traveller about my metaphysics of basically nihilism and I nearly bawled my eyes out. The idea that I'm alone in this universe and that nothing really matters has gone from empowering to terrifying.

I got a message today from a guy who's helping me ship the parts from South Africa - another Enfield enthusiast - who forwarded me this message from the man who owns the motorbike dealership in Cape town:

“I am trying to organise with my friends in tourism to get him some sponsored activities and accommodation on the way down as well (obviously he will get a special bike service once he gets down to Cape Town as well). Will you let him know that we can do loads of nice things for him to make his last few weeks an absolute dream holiday."

Unbelievable.

I was thrilled.

Touched.

I can’t believe that they think that I’m worth the fuss.

It’s had the immediate impact of lifting my spirits and turning what's left of the journey from a scary slog over to feeling like I can do it.

I _can_ do it.

I'm not alone anymore.

I can get this done.

---

There’s a girl at the hostel.

She’s from Finland.

And she’s giving me the “glad eye”. Bigtime. ("glad eye" is not my term, I didn't coin it, but it’s the only way I can describe it).

This is _diabolical_.

So much so that I get the feeling that someone’s playing a joke on me.

It’s a prank. _Gotta be_.

I’m not looking much better than I was last week in Tsumeb.

I’m still a mess.

Pale and pasty and tired looking and _old_ and flaky.

The sideburn sections of my travelling “beard” - just those alone - should be enough to send any member of the fairer sex bolting in the opposite direction.

Filth. Rank.

Even _I_ feel repulsed by them.

My flaky and chapped to hell lips are on the verge of just giving up and splitting down the middle; I could go on...

But when she asks “what are you doing today” and I say “Oh, just heading into town to buy a few things, y'know, look around.” she says “ Great! I’ll come with you!”.

“Uh... ok...”

_Baffling._

And she say's all that with _the glad eye._

And what eyes... Like nothing else. They’re _stunning_. And unblinking. She literally doesn't blink. It's unnerving. She’s not looking at me, it’s like she’s looking throught my head.

I find it hard to hold eye contact. It’s too intense.

We hit the town.

---

She’s beautiful, smart, sharp, well-travelled. Adventurous.

As we walk through Windhoek, my palms are sweating. I keep holding my breath. I feel faint and dizzy.

Exactly how I feel when I feel “sick”.

It is between the ears. It is. It’s in my head.

I _know_ it now.

---

We've cooked up some steaks together.

She's tailed me the whole day.

So. We’ve got glad eye from a girl of this sort of calibre, and what do I do?

Nothing.

Not a damn thing.

And I don’t even care. Why should I? A notch on the belt? What's that to me?

I’ve always found that an odd thing to pursue: a fling.

One night stand.

Sex.

And yet, to hear blokes talk about it, that’s as good as life gets.

It’s empty and futureless. Joyless.

Without commitment there can be no deep feeling.

No intimacy. A shell of what it should be.

“A rubbing of the members, followed by an ejaculation.” as old mate Marcus Aurelius blandly puts it.

I reckon that blokes talk it up because other blokes talk it up; I know that I do.

I don’t reckon that any man, deep down, feels any joy or contentment in a fling.

The opposite, if anything.

It’s bankrupt.

But they’ll all talk it up.

I don’t feel like I’m missing anything.

But that’s not the reason that I'm not pursuing Miss Finland. I’m not reciprocating in kind because I’m a pansy. Gutless.

A coward.

The poor girl’s putting in all the legwork and I’m giving her doughnuts.

When I'm sober you'll never get a return serve from me.

Get me drunk and it would happen in a twinkling... It would be _all_ the moves.

I need therapy.

## Chapter Fifteen

We have parts!

We are go!

I head into town and spend a few hours looking for a place to work.

I find a very whitewashed, very clean car dealership that does servicing. They’ve got a small motorbike arm attached to it.

_Perfect._

I go in and smooth talk my way up to the boss. I fill him in on the story so far, and ask if I can use one of their hydraulic lifts tomorrow - for the day - borrow the workshop tools to work on the bike.

He comes back with the usual reply that they’ll do the service themselves.

I don’t want anyone else touching the bike. Not even here.

I say that I’d rather do it. He shrugs his shoulders.

Done.

For free.

Beautiful.

A full day to have a crack at it.

---

Up early.

Off to the servo to give the Shrike its first non-river-water clean in a long time. Only out of necessity; I prefer the “I’ve been places, hard places” look. Covered in shit is when the Shrike looks its best, it’s gnarliest. But working on a filthy bike is suboptimal.

So it gets a good pressure hosing.

A _serious_ pressure hosing.

But it’s not enough. The mud and dust is just _everywhere_. Completely ingrained, like it's etched into the paint and metal and rubber and leather.

The sprocket is still absolutely covered in shit.

Won’t be moved. Pressure hose or not.

Whatever. It’ll have to do.

I go buy a spray can of “carb-clean”. This stuff isn't one of God's chemicals. It'd melt the paint off walls...

It'd dissolve anything.

I've seen it go through thick grease like a hot knife through butter.

Into the workshop and onto the lift. I give it to the lump of grimy oil, and it's exactly like I hoped it would be. After emptying the can and feeling light headed from the fumes it's clean as a whistle in there.

All the tools I need are here, but they’re sprawled out all over the workshop. But I'm taking it as a win, as there's nothing worse than a nit-picky, clean-as-a-surgeon mechanic.

I'm sharing the workshop with a chubby, young mechanic who’s keen to get involved in fixing up the Shrike. I tell him I’ll yell if I need a hand; I don’t want anyone else's hands on it.

_Right._

"Scalpel..."

I drain the sump while the oil is still hot and will flow easily.

First things first: all the usual servicing stuff.

Consult the manual.

I clean the little magnetic collector in the sump screw. It’s always covered in little shards of shaved off metal. Always mildly disturbing.

_Tick._

The spark plug comes out after popping off the cable lead with a screwdriver for leverage and then unscrewing it with a socket. When brand new the bit where the spark makes it's arc is whiter than my teeth. If it’s a dark brown it means that it’s time for a change.

It’s black.

_Charcoal_.

Doesn’t take a mechanic to tell you that that’s fucked...

I’m surprised. Then I’m surprised that I’m surprised.

What was I expecting? All that Congolese cat piss I've been putting in the tank; all those day’s where it ran like a twenty year old dog...

If the spark plug looks like this, the cylinder can’t be far different, and that can’t be good.

I wouldn’t know where to start with cleaning that up...

Seems complicated...

Yeah, fuck that.

This is not “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”.

This is "Insanity and the Art of Getting it Done".

I _can_ change the spark plug though, so that’s something, I guess.

The new one screws in just fine. But something weird is going on with the lead; it won’t make that satisfying neat little click noise as it goes back on.

Have I got the wrong plug type?? Don’t think so...

Right...

Fuck it.

_Tick._

Moving on.

The oil filter lives in the engine cover, jammed into its housing like a jack in the box - a big spring in there under constant stress to make sure that no oil bypasses it.

Coming out of the housing it’s no dramas, just gotta undo the three screws that hold its lid in place without it coming flying out, but getting the new one in there is always a pain in the arse. Like wrestling a bear into a box.

I need three hands for this...

Through no special technique and just trying over and over again I get the bolts screwed back in without it all coming flying back out at me.

Not sure it sealed right...

Fuck it.

_Tick._

The fuel hose linking the petrol tank to the fuel injector looks scummy and cracked like perished rubber, but it’ll last.

_Tick._

Throttle “play” is a little bit too much – that’s how much you can twist the throttle handle before it actually picks up the throttle, basically the amount of slack in the throttle cable; how loose it is. Fixing that is as simple as tightening a little nut where the throttle cable connects to the motor's air intake under the seat.

Easy.

_Tick._

All the rubber bits and hoses from the air box to that inlet stuff look ok. I reckon that the “replacement schedule” for all that stuff is way over the top; why replace it if it’s not broken/looking like shit?

_Tick._

Air filter. Looks ok... I give it a clean out in some engine oil. I still feel weird about cleaning an _air_ filter out with motor _oil_, but I know that’s what I’m supposed to do with this fancy type of filter. I leave that aside to drip dry.

_Tick._

“Inlet/Exhaust valve cleaning: Inspect"

Shit.

Those are the valves _inside_ the motor.

_How do I do that?_

I’d have to take the whole top off of the _bang-bang_ part of the motor just to get at the valves. Looks complicated. Looks above my pay-grade. Looks like there’s lots of places to fuck that right up. Not to mention the time... We’re already nearly lunch time...

Fuck it.

_Tick._

"Cylinder head/combustion chamber decarbonise."

Erm...

_Tick._

Lunch!

_Tick._

Clutch lever “play”. I tighten a little nut down by where the cable connects to a little pivot down by the gearbox housing.

Easy.

_Tick._

It says to grease the rear brake pedal pivot. That’s not important. I whack a bit of motor oil on it.

That’ll do.

_Tick._

Inspect the battery. Out comes the battery. Water level looks a little low. I don’t like mucking with that. Battery acid isn’t fun... Plus, it needs distilled water, that’s _distilled_, not _filtered_ or _spring water_ or whatever. Distilled water's the stuff you're supposed to use in a clothes iron, and it's the reason that we get all that white shit when we just use tap water.

Distilled water isn't a complicated thing; it's just pure H2O and nothing else. But finding it here is tricky....

Fuck it.

_Tick._

I whack some lube on the terminals. It's just Vaseline. I think that’s to stop them from corroding from water contact.

_Tick._

Front fork oil change. Too hard. I’ve never done it. Suspension works fine as is.

_Tick._

Chain play. That's a problem for when I change the sprocket...

_Half-tick._

Rear brake play. It’s fine.

_Tick._

Lube rear brake cam. I don’t even know what that _is_. Never done it. Rear brake works fine.

_Tick._

Lubricate steering ball races. Again, no idea. Steering works.

_Tick._

Spoke tightness. I ring a screwdriver around the spokes like a playing card in a pushy wheel and listen to the tune. If it doesn't make sounds like a wind chime and instead makes a dead sounding _thunk_, that's a problem, allegedly. They ring true.

_Tick._

Swing arm pivot bush and spacer. That's what was giving me the willies before with the swing arm rocking from side to side.

I tighten the swing arm bolt up, with no effect.

The bushing must be fucked. Not surprising, really; the shit I've been putting that suspension through...

I don't have a new one, so that's that... Dodgy, but what can I do about it?

_Tick._

Tyre wear. I'm not happy with the way that that back tyre's knobblies are getting chewed by the tarmac. It's a shit tyre.

I head over into the dealership to make enquiries. They've got nothing that's the right size.

_Tick._

Service done.

Kinda...

Righto, now the rest.

Wait... The carb clean has fucked the metal of the engine housing! _Jesus_, it’s dissolved a bit of the metal engine case, has it? The surface gone from smooth to rough. _Fuck._ This is powerful shit! It’s already evaporated off so there's nothing I can do. It’s only chewed one type of metal. Plate aluminium maybe? Obviously some severe reaction going on there...

Should I re-paint it?

With what??

Nup. Fuck it. Let’s just see what happens.

Hope it’s not still being eroded away...

Anyway. Moving right along.

I unscrew the bolts and the whole engine cover comes sliding off.

Inside, it's pristine. Mint condition metal dripping with clean oil. Chalk and cheese, compared with the rest of the bike.

On the inside, I know that one of those things is the alternator, the copper coils are a dead giveaway. There’s also a rod poking through from the other side of the engine that does the gear changes. Other than that, I've got no idea what any of this is. There’s some cogs with teeth but not a whole lot else. The gearbox is on the other side of the engine. Which is good, because that means there’s less that I can fuck up.

Wait. I fucking _knew_ it. I _knew_ it! There’s supposed to be a black rubber sleeve on the end of that rod, that changing gears rod.

It isn’t there.

Don’t ask me why, but I had a nagging hunch that has dogged me since way, _way_ back, after the last time I pulled the Shrike apart in Ghana. _I knew it._ But I wasn’t about to pull it all apart again to check; I thought I was being paranoid.

I remember the English mechanic saying “whatever you do, before you put it all back together, make sure that this little sleeve is on, and make sure that this little O-ring is in place. They’re important”

Didn’t do that last time. And now it’s not there.

Be fucked if I know where it got to. I wouldn’t have touched it last time, and there’s nowhere inside here that it could possibly go missing...

I'm not entirely sure what it’s supposed to do either...

I don’t have a spare.

Fuck it. What can I do?

I make a mental note of it and move on.

At least the little O-ring is there.

Gotta be careful from now on; anything that gets into this space is going to stay in the engine with the oil until the next change. Which is bad... I remember when we changed the sprocket for the first time back in England that the mechanic was super particular about this: Don’t get shit in the engine.

But that’s gonna be tough; there’s still mud everywhere around the sprocket that was obstructed from view by the engine cover.

I spray carb clean over it as carefully as I can, but shit gets everywhere. I can’t clean this and keep the inner bits pristine. I do my best.

I get the camera out and go full paparazzi on the internals; you never know when they might be useful, particularly for remembering how it all goes back together again. Rough, I know.

The stator of the alternator looks weird. That’s the copper wire bundle bit. There's black string wrapped up in it for some reason. I don't remember that being there before... Like it’s been caught up in it somehow.

On further inspection, it doesn't look like it could have possibly got there by accident.

I check through the photo archives. I’ve never thought to take a picture of it before. _Damn it._

New photo taken, moving on.

Sprocket.

I go to flatten out the little flap of metal that “locks” the sprocket nut down. And the sprocket nut _moves_.

Fuck a duck!

Shit a brick.

Cheeeesus H...

It’s not even _finger_ tight.

Back in England I remember them tightening that nut with a spanner as long as my arm...

Now it’s just _floating_ there! The only thing holding it where it is is that flimsy little locking flap of metal.

Fuck. If that let go... Jeee-sus.

How does that even _happen_?

How long has this thing been on the cusp of completely letting go?

Looking on the bright side, at least it’ll come off easy.

Silver linings...

Off comes the nut. I pull the sprocket out and compare it with my spare.

The old one has its teeth worn away, but not that bad. Subtle, even.

I want to keep the old one; going back down from 19 teeth to 18 teeth is going to make the top comfortable cruising speed 1/19th less. Which is, what? a touch over 5%? Doesn’t seem like much, but I’m going to be doing a lot of straight line, boring highway from here on out. I want all the advantages I can get...

I’ll worry about that later. Right now: Seals.

I’m keen to stop that oil haemorrhage. I reckon that the culprit is busted seals.

Pretty simple thing, seals; just a black ring of hard plastic that goes between something that spins, and something that doesn’t. Nothing technical. Basically stops all the oil from bleeding out.

The seal that I reckon’s had it is the one that goes between the shaft the sprocket sits on and the engine housing. I can get at it now that the sprocket’s out of the road.

I try to get it out with some pointy nose pliers.

I feel like I’m playing the game “Operation”...

The seal is doing too good of a job, it’s locked in there, hard.

I can’t get enough purchase on it to pull it out. But I _can_ get enough purchase to completely butcher it.

If it wasn’t fucked before, it definitely is now...

After ten minutes of hacking away I’ve make no progress, except to gouge chunks out of the bloody thing. If I can’t get this out, with the seal this fucked, the bike won’t make it down the road... I’m _pissed_.

Young chubby mechanic buddy comes round to ask what all the fuss and swearing is about. He wants to have a crack at it.

Why not?

He’s does exactly what I’ve been doing, just chopping up the seal.

While he’s here anyway, I ask him about the old sprocket.

“Do ya reckon it’s ok to keep using?”

He takes a good look at it. I show him where the teeth have been worn down. He says it’s still good. No worries. Just turn it around.

"Flip it."

I’m happy to be backed up. But I do wonder about the veracity of the opinion... I wonder if he knows what the fuck he’s on about...

He keeps hacking away at the seal.

Seems about as pro as me. Which is to say, a flog.

We’re not getting anywhere, he buggers off.

I stay at it; It’s gotta give eventually; there’s no alternative. I can’t win by just butchering it, or cutting it out, because the plastic is mounded around a steel spring. _Fuck this._

A random bloke comes past.

He - roughly - asks me what I’m doing.

He’s not a mechanic; he's not wearing the kit. Rough looking bloke. Maybe not rough. Sounds rough... Maybe “_rugged_” is better. Three-day beard. Middle age. Yeah, bit rough. Windswept.

“I can’t get this _fucking_ seal out." I keep hacking at it.

_“Stop.”_

He goes and grabs a big wrench, wraps it around the stainless steel pipe I'm trying to pull the seal off, and pulls the _whole lot_ out.

_Who knew that that wasn’t connected to something??_

Not that chubby fat fucker, that’s for sure.

It’s not a pipe, like I thought, more like a little collar, and the seal has come out with it.

The bloke pulls the seal off with his fingers.

“There you go.”

“Uh, I didn’t know it did that... Thanks. Thanks a lot.”

He nods and goes to leave

“Hey, are you a mechanic?”

“Yeah.”

“What do you think of this sprocket?”

He looks at it for half a second. Less.

“Completely fucked.”

Well, it’s hard to get more definitive than that...

“Completely fucked?”

“Yeah, completely fucked,” He looks at me enquiringly, not sure if I’m a little thick in the head. Like it's bleedingly obvious. He sighs.

“Do you see all this...?” he points at the teeth. "that's fucked..."

He puts down the down the sprocket and picks up the chain. Feels the links and takes a close look.

“This is fucked too.”

“What? The chain??” No way... But he nods. "Mate, that chain’s brand _new._"

“How can the chain be new? It's fucked. You’ve got to change them together; chain and sprocket. Wait... _You changed the chain without changing the sprocket?_”

“Ah, yeah? Why?”

“What did you do that for??”

Maybe I am thick in the head… School’s definitely not out. I feel like a kid.

“The chain snapped out on the road. I couldn’t do a sprocket change out there. It was only a couple of hundred kilometres ago...”

“Yeah, well, this chain’s fucked now”

“But, I’ve hardly ridden on it...”

“I don’t know what to tell ya. You’ve gotta change the sprocket and chain together. Sorry, I’ve gotta go.”

And off he goes.

_Shit!_

Well. At least I’ve got the seal off now...

That silly chubby wanker was telling me to “flip it”. _Fuck’s sake._ What is it about folks and never being able to use the words “I don’t know” here?

It’s like they’re allergic to it.

“Flip it”.

Dickhead.

Anyway. That whole “links sitting up on the teeth and then pop down into place” thing - combined with the crazy tightness - must’ve turned two hundred kilometres into twenty thousand...

Right then. No use crying over spilt milk...

I go over to the dealership to enquire about a new chain. They don’t have anything on-spec. That’s a bit shit.

I’m not about to go on a wild goose chase through Windhoek for another chain when the chain I’ve got is still working.

Bugger it. I’m running out of time.

The new seal goes on even tighter than the first one. Which, I guess, is what I was going for, right? But this one feels _way_ too tight. Like, I've-got-the-wrong-part sort of tight...

_Shiiit._

Out of time.

_Tick._

I flick out a similar seal on the gear lever where it meets the housing with a flick of a flat-head screwdriver. New one goes in. Feels like it fits.

_Tick._

Right. Now. Put it all back together...

Sprocket slides onto the shaft. Can't tighten it till I've got the chain on (otherwise it'll just spin).

I undo the rear axle and slide all that forward, put the chain on the two sprockets, slide the wheel back to tension the chain, lock it up tight.

So much fucking easier with the right tools, when you're standing up, and it’s all right in front of your face, and there’s no white-hot exhaust pipe.

I whack one hand on the rear brake pedal to stop things from spinning and torque the shit out of that sprocket nut with a monstrous spanner. No chance that’s coming loose. Ever. Up goes the lock flap.

On goes the new engine cover gasket - which is just glorified cardboard cut-out – and then the whole engine cover on after it. It’s tricky; if you don’t get it just right the gasket will fold, or miss the mark, and you’ll get a leak. I can’t see what I'm doing, there's too much motorbike in the way of getting my head in there to look.

I think I’ve got it right... But there's no way to test it.

_Tick._

On go the skinny bolts that hold it in place.

Oil.

I go and ask what they’ve got. _Nothing’s on-spec._

And I'm running out of day...

I need an oil spec of "15w50". I’m not 100% on what that even means; I think it’s to do with viscosities at two different temperatures? Or the other way around? Nothing to do with quality, anyway.

Not sure I want to roll the dice here though. Plus, here the spec is some weird "SAE" format. I’ve got no fucking clue what that means. No one here can give me a straight answer either.

Nup. Time to take a walk. Hunting petrol stations.

---

First station is a negative. SAE.

Second station, same again.

Third one, same again.

I must’ve walked a couple of clicks by now, and I’m getting further and further away from the workshop.

It’s getting late.

What else can I do? I keep walking.

---

Fourth one, right on the outskirts of the city.

_Yes_. Victory.

20w50.

That’ll do.

I buy five bottles and head back to the workshop.

---

Must’ve taken me over an hour. It’s a lot darker on the walk back to the workshop than it was on the walk out...

When I get back, the lads at the workshop are wondering where I’ve been.

They’ve cleaned up. Ready to go home. _Waiting for me._

_Shit!_

Time to move...

I dump four bottles into the sump and that’s it pretty full on the sight glass. Seems about right. Happy to have a spare bottle in case I haven't patched the leak and it’s still pissing oil.

Right.

Done?

I give it a looking over. Making sure I haven’t missed something obvious.

I've got an audience. An impatient audience.

Throttles and clutches and nuts and oil levels and tyre alignments and rear wheel...

I spin the rear wheel again...

_The wheel won’t spin._ At least not freely.

What?? Nah. What’s going on??

Brakes? Is the brake stuck on?

No.

Spin. Stop. Spin. Stop.

In neutral? Yep.

What’s going on? It should spin almost as easily as the front wheel does...

Erm...

Blanks... I’m drawing blanks.

I haven’t _touched_ the rear brakes.

Shiiiiiiiiiiit. _SHIT!_

I’ve got no idea.

I’ll have to figure it out later, or hope that it sorts itself out...

It’ll still roll. And I've gotta leave.

I roll the bike off the lift and roll it around the workshop.

I can’t _feel_ an appreciable difference. It’ll be ok.

I throw my kit on, jacket, gloves and helmet, while I’m thanking the guys who are left over for letting me use all their stuff and for being patient and just, thanks for everything.

Half my head is still trying to figure out why that wheel wont spin. It’s either something in the rear wheel, something in the chain, or something in the sprocket...

I turn the key and let wait for the whirr of the fuel pump to finish. I hit the ignition.

_Nothing._

I hit it again.

Nothing. _Not a sound_.

I hit it _again._

Silence.

Shit fuck shit what the fuck??

I’m in _deep_ shit now.

I turn the key off, wait, turn it on again - wait for the fuel pump - hit the ignition.

Nada.

_What the fuck?_

The battery’s connected, otherwise the fuel pump and lights wouldn’t work.

Spark plug? It never clicked properly when I replaced that lead...

I shove on that.

Hit the ignition.

Nothing.

Erm...

Blanks. Mental blanks.

I’ve got _nothing_.

Neither does fat fuck mechanic. Not sure I’d trust him anyway.

I fiddle with everything. Throttle, clutch, move the steering around, flick around the headlights, move the choke. Useless shit. I know it is.

I can hear in my head an old quote from Einstein; something about the definition of stupidity being "to do the same thing twice and expect a different outcome." Or something like that...

What else can I do? I’ve got nothing but stupid left.

Turn the key off again, turn it on again. Hit the ignition.

_Click-a-click-a-click-a-boom! Boom boom boom..._

Alive.

_None of that makes any fucking sense._

Right. Fuck it. It works.

That's Enfield's for you.

Get out of here.

---

On the road and something feels wrong. Off. Weird. Not right.

Don’t know what it is.

Might just be me...

Fifteen minutes and we’ve made it to the hostel. No dramas.

I get off, whack the Shrike on its centre stand and spin the rear wheel.

Now it’s really, _really_ stuck. Seizes up much quicker than before. Like. Locked up.

And something’s making a squeaking noise when I force it to spin, like there’s a mouse trapped in the gearbox.

_Faaaaark._

While I’m playing with it I draw a little crowd from the hostel. Standing around me and the Shrike while I lie on the floor and try to figure this out.

One of them is a real weird fucker who’s been here at the hostel longer than I’ve been here. I reckon he’s here permanently. He's on the other side of middle age. I reckon his eyes are fucked too - he’s always looking _past_ me. Half blind, maybe.

You’ve never met anyone more casually racist in all your life. Some of the shit that’s come out of this blokes mouth... The yarpy’s a fruit loop. And that accent... fuck me. Normally, it’s a little funny, but on this bloke it’s like someone whining while running nails down a blackboard.

Anyway, my mate, he wants to know what’s going on, so I give him the story.

“Oh, it’s definitely the chain”

Right. _Thanks..._

Over the next ten minutes it goes from being "definitely the chain", to definitely the wheel alignment, to the axle, to the sprocket. Free advice from dickheads who have no idea what they're fucking talking about. Like a pack of hens clucking away. It’s fucking infuriating.

I try to take the attitude that this is great practice for dealing with wankers, but that’s wearing thin, and quickly...

Anyway. I reckon that squeaking’s coming from the gearbox. And that’s probably not good.

I’m spinning the wheel with my foot and listening with my ear to the engine case. Homing in...

It’s the seal.

Yup. _Definitely_ coming from that seal I replaced.

“It’s the seal” I say.

“You should put some Vaseline on it”

“What? Is that a joke?”

“No, you should have put Vaseline on it, why didn't you do it?”

“Yeah, alright mate, maybe next time.”

There’s nothing I can really do about it, short of waiting here another few weeks for a new seal to come in, and then do the exact same thing again...

Nope. Going to cross my fingers and just hope that it "wears itself in". That’s about all I can do.

Fuck I wish someone would show up in a truck, heading to Cape Town.

## Chapter Sixteen

No truck.

The moment I realise that it’s time to go soon, all that good work - the last two weeks of starting to feel better, to feel a little bit like _me_ again - disappears.

I’m right back in the gun again.

I can’t think straight again.

I can’t walk straight again.

I’ve got no excuse to stay any longer in Windhoek. There’s nothing left here to wait for, nothing to do.

I’ve been here much, much too long already.

As much as I don’t want to, it’s time to go.

---

I’m not feeling that bad as I ride out of the hostel. I’m scared but not terrified. And it’s weird...

I _should_ be terrified; odds on that something will fuck up today. Shrike won’t start, wheels wont spin. What are the chances that the Shrike will even get out of Windhoek without crapping out? let alone the next town down, which is a half day's ride away.

Not good.

Nothing left to do but have a crack.

_I’m over it._

If the Shrike craps out, if the slightest thing goes wrong, I’m ready to light a funeral pyre, throw the Shrike on top of it, do a little dance around it as everything burns to the ground, and call it a day.

_Fuck all of this._

---

No noticeable change.

If there is any squeaking coming from that seal, I can’t hear it. Probably because of the thump of the engine and the wind roar in my helmet.

Not a whole lot going on out here in middle-of-nowhere Namibia... Pretty empty. Pretty bland.

It’s weird. But the blandness isn’t freaking me out. It’s uneventful out there, and it’s uneventful _in here_.

No idea why. But it’s nice.

I pass the Tropic of Capricorn. The tropics of Capricorn and Cancer are the lowest and highest points on the globe where the sun can still pass directly overhead. Bet you didn’t know that.

The last time I passed the Tropic of Capricorn on the ground I was at home.

It makes me feel like I’m close.

I take some shit photos.

---

Before I know it I’m in Mariental, today's stop.

When did that happen??

The clicks just flew by...

I’ll take that.

I check in at a pretty swish guesthouse by the highway. Only $N200. Twentyish bucks. Not bad.

---

There’s bugger all to do here. Town’s like this are just flat out depressing. I spend the hours trying to get out of my own head, watching TV, and reading Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, which if you haven’t read, you should.

Drop this book and start reading that instead. It's much better.

Anyway. The Shrike’s fine. Actually, riding really well. Surprisingly well.

Superbly, in fact.

I don’t think it’s ever felt better.

I don’t know whether it’s the new sprocket or what, but the bike feels even better at high speeds, when the math say's it shouldn’t.

Everything feels _planted_, even up over eighty. Usually - around eighty - it starts doing some bone rattling, like it’s going to shake itself all to pieces.

I’m baffled by the change in performance, but I’ll take the free win.

I take an early dinner of a pizza, so glutinous that I can only eat half of it and I feel like I’m going to blow it up again all over the table. The toppings are an inch thick!

The tight-arse in me says “finish the fucking pizza, and just don’t eat anything for the next few days”. I’m worried about making a scene...

I eat another slice.

Then go hibernate.

---

Today, _Keetmanshoop._

It’s gotta be my favourite name for a town this side of _Nouadhibou._

I don’t know why, but I keep saying “Keeeeeet-maaaaaan-shooooop” over and over again in my helmet in a deep voice.

Maybe I _am_ losing it...

I skip yet another one of Namibia’s “must see's” - Sossusvlei - which I can spell, but not say... Apparently it's spectacular. I don’t care. Not one bit. I’m heading south. In a fucking _beeline_.

Straight highway. Gunbarrel straight. Boring-as-fucking-bat-shit straight.

Nothing but time and distance and nothing to fucking do but look at the road, all the way off to the vanishing point.

Enough to drive anyone nuts.

There’s a loud, _very loud_ whirring coming from the rear tyre. Like it’s flat or underdone, or just dying.

I can’t tell.

The only pressure gauge I have are my thumbs. They tell me that everything’s ok. Dunno what the noise is, then.

Maybe the bearing’s in the wheel have gone to hell? Maybe it’s just the noise that these tyre’s make on this sort of tarmac?

Impossible to tell.

These tarmac miles is doing an absolute number on the knobbly tyres. It's being chewed off at a rate that I can notice.

Just gotta chalk it up and get on with it; I’ve got no spare.

KEEEET-MAAAAAN-SHOOOOOP….

Today's a short ride, but I’m taking a million stops on the way. Taking it easy. Staying fresh. Staying on top of it.

---

By the time I get into Keeeeeetmaaaaaaanshooooooop I must’ve taken my helmet off and put it back on maybe twenty times. It’s scrubbed my ears off and worn holes in the tail of my eyebrows, to the point where I don't bother to take it off to fill petrol and check tyre pressures.

Pressures are fine. Go figure.

Keeeeeetmaaaaaaanshooooooop seems alright. Colonial-ish. Biggish.

At the first accommodation option, I rip my ears off only to get told that they’re fully booked. Rip the eyebrows off to put the lid back on.

Same story for the second one.

By the third one I feel like someone’s given me papercuts and then lifted me by the earlobes.

_Fuck this._

This joint’s gotta stick; I’ll be fucked if I’m putting that helmet on again.

No one's home...

_Fuck._

I’m yelling. _Loud._

Someone rocks up. They look a little shat off at the disturbance.

Despite this, they’ve got a room for me, with a double bed, _two_ single beds, a serious shower, a flippin _bath_, and a full kitchen, all for me, all in the same room, all immaculate and all brand spanking new, all for $N290. Thirty bucks. That’s three times what I’m in the market for, but it’s too good to pass this up, and I’ll be fucked if I’m putting that helmet on again...

_Sold._

---

I stay for two nights.

A rest I didn’t really need. But took it anyway. Best to pace myself. What’s the rush?

I've spent hardly any time out of bed.

Not proud of that.

---

Time to move on again.

It’s tempting to make today a monster ride.

The border is only three hundred clicks away, not the four hungee that I thought it was.

I can do that... Tempting...

Nup.

_Don't even think about it._

Cut it in half. Baby steps.

Two days of small rides. That’s easy. And the only village on the ride is smack bang in the middle. Perfect.

## Chapter Seventeen

It’s fucking freezing this morning. Coldest day in memory. By a long shot.

The sun is bright in the eyes, blazing, the sky is absolutely spotless, yet it’s as cold as a witch’s tit.

The air's not catching any of the sun's bright rays, and neither am I.

We sure as shit ain’t in the tropics anymore...

The Shrike's not too happy to get started, but it starts.

I give it a long time to warm up in neutral, and take off.

---

My hands are useless.

It's only been ten clicks, and they're as good as wood.

These thin, fingerless leather gloves don’t do shit.

My finger’s literally won’t move on instruction, they’re just clawed onto the handlebars.

I’m glad the road is straight and long and featureless; I’ll be buggered if I know what would happen if I needed to use the brakes...

The shivers are constant.

A big, violent shiver, and I the bike wobbles under the force, gets out of shape, and I nearly fucking bin it.

_This is ridiculous._

I pull over and run. Run and run and run. Like a loony, swinging my arms in time with my feet like I’m swimming the butterfly.

After five minutes I’ve got some circulation back in all of my fingers except one; the ring finger on my right hand is still as white and cold and useless as a corpse's.

I keep running.

Hard to say what’s going on with my feet; they're so frozen that it feels like I’m running around on wooden clogs.

That can’t be good.

Another 5 minutes, and that’s about as good as it’s going to get...

I jump on the bike and by the time I’m up to cruising speed I’m already shivering again.

That air is _biting_ cold. When it’s this fucking freezing and moving over you at speed, it chills to the bone in _seconds_.

It’s almost worse after warming up; the blood has been coaxed back into the capillaries only to be promptly turned to ice again, and I feel colder than I did before.

_This is fucking shit._

---

It keeps being fucking shit.

It never warms up, and neither do I.

Another one of Namibia’s must-see’s, Fish River Canyon - the second biggest canyon in the world after the Grand Canyon - comes and goes, a mere forty clicks to the West.

I know forty clicks is nothing - nothing at all, to see the second biggest canyon in the world - But I _can’t_. I know it’s ridiculous. I know it’s wildly irrational. But I never even consider it.

I ride right on by.

---

I take a hundred breaks to stave off what I don’t reckon I’m being overly dramatic in saying is hypothermia. And so the light jaunt to _Grunau_ takes me to well on the other side of lunch.

Grunau’s tiny.

Small enough that it almost shouldn’t exist. A handful of nothing buildings.

Based on the size of the font that they’ve given it on the map, it would seem to be the biggest place this side of Keetmanshoop...

Yeah, righto.

Gives a bit of an idea just how much of anything there is in this part of the world...

Which makes it surprising (and delighting) that they’ve got decent accommodation that even has a _restaurant_.

Stoked with that.

The restaurant is shut, and I’ve missed lunch, so I go hungry. There literally isn’t a single thing to eat in Grunau till the restaurant re-opens for dinner.

---

I can write again.

I can write again and stay lucid, stay feeling like _me._

The room doesn't spin.

I write everything I can fit. Everything I've been wanting to write for weeks. I get it all out. _Everything._ I don't know when I'll be able to write again...

## Chapter Eighteen

Today’s a big day.

A massive box to tick.

_My last border crossing._

The end. The last country.

“After this there is no more, Jimmy”

The first town in South Africa is a place called Springbok, which is a great name.

It’s a long way, a long ride, a long day in the saddle.

Plus a border crossing...

Two hundred and fifty clicks. I haven't ridden anything near that distance in a long time...

But there’s no real option; there’s bugger all in between here and there.

---

On the road. I’m nervy.

There’s fuck all out here. No traffic. No nothing, just same old boring, flat, featureless Namibia.

The Shrike’s behaving weirdly; It’s just a feeling. In top gear like this, where we’d usually be cruising, things feel slower than they should. Like we're in the wrong gear, but we’re not.

Are the clutch plates slipping? It’s the only place between the motor going "bang" and the wheels spinning that the bike could lose some speed, where things could, mechanically, slip. Everything else is locked in.

I’m not even sure how to visualise that.

Or is it just my perspective that’s off?

_Who knows._

All I can do is worry about it.

And the last few days the Shrike has felt on point, running superbly. So what’s all this?

---

As a hundred odd kilometres roll by under the wheels it seems to sort itself out. I think.

---

The next fifty are just about getting there.

---

And then we’re here. Finally.

Namibian Police wave me down before I even get into the post. Which is novel.

I leave the bike in neutral, just idling.

“What do you want?”

That’s him asking... Not me.

Aggressively, too. What the fuck mate? I’m not even _in_ the border post yet.

“What do _I_ want? I’m going to South Africa.”

“Why?”

“_Why?_ Because I want to...”

“_Where_ have you come from?”

“What? Today?”

“Yes.”

“Grunau. Grunau?”

“Where have you come from with this bike?”

“England.”

“How did you get it here?”

Fuck’s sake mate, what do you reckon?

“I rode it.”

“No, how did you get it here from England?”

He doesn’t believe me. Why would I lie? What I want to say is “What the fuck is it to you, mate, I don’t have to explain myself to you, ya twat.”

I pull out my passport instead and give it to him “Have a look at that.”

He leafs through. Takes his time.

“All _this??_”

“Yeah.”

“On _that??_”

That makes me chuckle...

“Yeah mate.”

He wants to shake my hand. Now we’re best mates.

“After you’re finished, you give this to me” He points at the bike and hands me back my passport.

"No worries mate, but you’ll have to get in line!"

I’m into the post.

---

I head to Immigration. They’ve got paperwork and twenty questions for me.

Fucking annoying.

By the time they’ve asked me where I _entered_ Namibia I want to yell at them “I’m _leaving_ Namibia for sucks sake! Just stamp the bloody passport!”

My answers are all vague. Intentionally vague.

“Where did I enter? Somewhere in the north.”

“But which border post?”

“I don’t know.”

“Ok, where did you stay?”

“What? Where did I stay?”

“Yes.”

“I stayed in Grunau last night.”

“Ok, where before then?”

“I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?”

“No.”

Etcetera...

Eventually I wade my way through the layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and questions and paperwork, and I get stamped out.

I avoid Customs; I need nothing from them.

I get out of Namibia.

## Chapter Nineteen

South Africa.

We’re finally _here_.

This side of the post looks proper modern.

I don’t like modern. It implies organisation. Organisation is my enemy. It means bureaucracy.

I head to Immigration. It’s schmicko. Proper tidy.

I wait my turn and then front up to the woman behind the counter and hand her my papers.

She leafs through my passport. Doesn’t look up.

“When will you go back to your home country?”

“What the fuck is it to you??” Doesn’t get said...

“I don’t know.”

She looks up; I'm not sure she gets that response very often...

“O-kaay...”

She gives me back my passport.

“Ok?”

“Ok.”

Fuck...

Done.

No paperwork.

Poor girl’s job must be mind-numbingly boring...

I’m _in_.

I jump on the Shrike.

We pull out of the post, but get waved down by the cops on the way out.

They want my passport.

Leafing though.

“Where will you stay?”

“In hotels.”

I think they were after a location, not a smart-arse answer...

I’m sick of the fucking questions though.

The cop's cogged that I’m not going to be putting up with any shit. He hands me back the passport and I’m in, in. _Properly_ in.

That’s it.

No more borders.

_Never, ever again._

---

Straight away it’s a huge improvement over Namibia. But, really, that’s just saying it’s a huge improvement on a sensory deprivation level of nothingness. Which isn’t setting the bar all that high.

It’s weird. They must’ve decided that where the hills start is where they’re going to draw the border between the two countries; the road's immediately gone from dead flat to a little hilly, a little green. Things to see. A bit of colour.

The roads are still gun barrel straight though. The slight tailwind of the morning has turned into a hard headwind, and it's absolutely bitchin'.

It doesn’t take long till I’m exhausted. The constant buffeting of the wind makes it feel like I’m going twice as fast as I am; I've even got to get a bit of a tuck going.

---

The road just goes on and on and on.

I feel like I’m making no progress. I don’t think I’m going to get to Springbok. But there’s nothing between here and there. Absolutely blank on the map and on the landscape.

I feel the desperation drip in, building with my fatigue.

And on and on it builds as the road slowly crawls past.

I feel like I'm treading water...

I take a break, and walk it off.

But it doesn’t help.

---

The closer I get to Springbok the more frantic things become.

I’m terrified that I’m going to melt down before I make it there.

I was always hoping that when I got to South Africa I’d have a little relief.

With nothing to do, nothing to worry about except getting the miles done. I could be in Cape Town in three days. I could relax a little.

A little respite.

But that’s not going to be the case, apparently.

I grind it out. With ten clicks to go till Springbok it’s getting late in the day, with the sun disappearing behind the hills. And I’m knackered.

Absolutely spent. And as my energy depletes my anxiousness rises. Till I don’t think I can deal with being on this bike anymore. In my head anymore. I have to get out. I can't do this.

I’m swooning in the saddle. So woozy it’s getting dangerous. I can’t sharpen my mind. I can’t control it...

---

And then I’m here.

Springbok.

Suddenly the infinite time collapses and feels short again.

I scope out a place to stay...

Accommodation options are thin on the ground. One place has no rooms for me. The other place, a hostel, looks like it should be open, but, after pushing the buzzer forever it’s apparent that it’s not open. With no way to call them I’m wondering if I should jump that nasty looking gate and have a snoop around inside.

Nope.

I wait it out. There’s not much else to do.

I don’t want to get on the bike again.

---

After a long half an hour I’m rewarded for my patience. A big heifer rocks up. She seems shitty to see me, like it would have been easier if there was no business today.

Don’t worry, love, I’m not thrilled to be here either.

We head inside.

It’s shit.

I’m the only one here.

Zero anything.

The place is just a big shed with beds. All I can think of is how fucking cold it’s going to get tonight, and that bedsheet is so thin...

But, beggars can’t be choosers.

Once shacked up and with nothing to do I go to write something.

I write the date, the place, and then the line “Well, here we are! Made it to the end country”… and then, a complete meltdown.

From tired to insane in seconds.

Like I’m not only about to fall off the bed, but fall off _everything_.

Utter terror. Full blown fight or flight response. Fizzing adrenaline. The overwhelming urge to run to somewhere safer. Anywhere that's not _here_.

I’m losing my mind.

I’m going to write about it.. I hover my hand ready to write. And... I’m going to be sick.

I’m losing my fucking mind.

What happens on the other side of this?

I can’t write a single letter. To write anything would be to admit it. To admit it is to make it real. And I can’t do that. I can’t. What would happen if I did?

The irreversible is the terror. The utter fear that something is going to happen that can’t be undone. Ever.

I leave.

Walking.

Out of the hostel. Fleeing.

I walk and walk and go get something to eat. Distract myself. And things start to get a little more normal.

_I can’t keep doing this_.

I’m not going to make it...

And it happens, again...

---

I hate Springbok.

It’s not at all like I expected. I expected - and wanted - a big modern city. Like my home, or maybe a little smaller, but something _like_ that.

This is a _town_.

Maybe not even that...

A couple of main roads and some streets. That’s it.

But I can’t leave.

I’m shitting my pants that I’m going to crap out like I did last night, but on the road.

I came good last night, after a while. If you can call _this_ “good”, which it’s not. But it’s taken its toll, it's done it’s damage. I need to give my brain a break. It can’t take much more. I can feel the doom coming.

So, I take a long, long walk.

I head to the top of the mountain whose valley this "town” sort of sits in like a bowl.

Takes a good hour.

To greet me at the top is a monstrous phallus of a monument as big as I am tall, carved out of stone. What it’s doing here is anyone’s guess...

I take a photo, and future me is scathing; when it comes time to go back through the photos of the trip - many years from now - I reckon I’m going to be disappointed in my choices; hardly any photos of Africa, zero humans, just weird stuff. Giant monument to cocks makes the cut.

I head back to town.

Eat lunch.

Spend the afternoon looking for things to distract myself with and find nothing. This joint is just a hole.

I head to the hostel and I can’t write. I can’t read.

I stare at the ceiling for a few hours.

Then sleep.

Break: Achieved.

## Chapter Twenty

Three riding days to go.

Three more destinations.

_Three._

All the time in the world to do it in.

Today: _Vanrhysndorp._ How the fuck do you say that?

It's somewhere between two hundred and three hundred clicks south.

It should be a cakewalk. But I don’t feel good about it.

_I don’t want to get on the bike_.

Well rested brain or not, it feels like I’m being _conditioned_ to hate it. Every time I go near the bike I’m repulsed by the idea of riding it.

I’m scared for my safety. Less and less the physical, more and more in the head. I don’t feel that “I” am safe when I’m on the bike.

“I” feel like it’s going to change me.

And I don’t want to change; Not when I don’t know what that change is, or what life looks like on the other side.

It’s the _event horizon_ of my mind, the point at which I can't see beyond, and I want to stay the fuck away from it.

Every time I get on that bike I feel it sucking me closer, like a goddamn singularity.

I should be feeling chilled out; South Africa was supposed to be a victory lap. But that's not it at all...

It's a fucking grind. But there's no other way to do it; every inch needs to be done sitting on the Shrike.

Better get to it.

---

Closer and closer to Varhyswhatever it’s just _ramping_. Out of control.

I have to take more and more breaks to separate it out. To kill the exponential rise. But each time I feel more panicked when I put my helmet back on, till I start to feel physically repulsed as I squeeze it over my ears.

---

Last break; thirty clicks from Vahryblahblah, off comes the helmet, and I take a long, long walk.

I’ve parked on top of a little crest in the road, and for everywhere I can see - in every direction - there’s nothing.

Utterly alone.

I come back to the bike; there’s nothing left to do but to get on it.

It's only thirty clicks... But I can't do another second...

I can’t breathe enough.

The breaths come easy, but it’s like it’s coming through a straw, till I’m sucking in full lungful’s through my mouth, on my haunches.

I can’t get back on the bike. I _can’t_ make myself do it.

My face twists up.

It’s happening.

I’m breaking.

By reflex, I look wildly, _franticly_, for somewhere to flee to.

Escape! _RUN!_ But there’s nowhere to hide here.

It crashes into me like a king wave. Obliterating me.

I lock up my jaw as my whole body shakes itself apart, like standing epilepsy.

I can’t think a thing. Can’t articulate a feeling, a thought; the terror has fogged everything except the need to flee _this_.

It endures, and endures, and endures, while I uselessly crawl my rattling hands back and forth over the Shrike. Looking for something. Something to help. Something to make it stop.

My body can’t endure it. And turns it off.

Minutes later, I’m crouched next to the bike with a hand the handlebar, another holding my face. And something, strange, like a soft release, spreads quickly, gently through me. Like a drug. It feels amazing, that softness, like the greatest drug no one’s ever taken.

I’m still Me.

Foggy, scared, but _Me_.

I really thought that that was going to be it...

I can’t do that again...

Something’s going to give.

In the softness, I don’t resist when I put my helmet on, there's no repulsion. I get on the bike, and go.

---

Vanrhysndorp.

I've been drowning myself for two days in television and the Commonwealth games. I only leave my hotel room to eat.

I reflect on what happened out on the road. The _episode_.

While it was happening, it was happening for _eternity_. I mean that literally. It's not a metaphor. Because the future is eternal, and, while I was in _it_, there was no way to know if it would stop, so, possibly, it might not, and if it does not, then what I was enduring never ends.

That’s forever.

Not knowing the future is what stretches moments into true eternities, not because that’s how long the moment lasts, but because that’s how long it _could_ last. It’s a thing of the mind. While in that moment, while living it, it _is_ eternal. And then it’s not, and it feels short again. But while _in_ that moment...

Fuck.

I feel like failure - _catastrophic_ failure - is imminent. Not only imminent, but almost inevitable. Like an impending, fated doom.

As I’ve got closer to Cape Town – my goal, my finish line – the tension, _my tension_, seems to be ratcheting. Every day. Every click. Always ratcheting tighter, and never going backwards.

Never slackens.

I can't believe I got back on the bike again...

I feel like I got lucky, to be able to close the distance and make it here to Vanrhysndorp without snapping in two.

What scares me – not on the same level of fear as going beyond that mental event horizon, but fear nonetheless – is that I’m going to make it within sight of Cape Town, and through no external forces, I’ll fail.

Just like shitting myself when I saw the islands on that fucking boat in Guinea-Bissau. I saw the finish line and my body decided that it had held out long enough... Cue the fire hose...

I've travelled more than thirty thousand of the toughest clicks, and I'll fail in the last few hundred of the easiest...

I’ve seen it before: blokes who do ultra-distance ironman races. They've been swimming and riding and running for double-digit hours, and then fail when they’re in sight of the finish line. After hours of exertion and with only seconds to run and they fail.

I fear that a capitulation, this time, in similar circumstances, will be far more disastrous than that overboarding in Bissau. To fail now... it’d be something I couldn’t live with.

But, whether I can live with it or not, I can feel that the urge to accept failure, to give up, is ratcheting as we go. And ratcheting with it is this _thing_. It's all going to hell in a handbasket.

In a marathon, it feels incrementally more impossible – with every single step it gets harder – till it’s over.

Like the ironman and the finish line, the boat and the island - all that can save me now is Cape Town. Only two more rides...

Far more than for “success” – far, far more than that – is because I can’t keep feeling _this way_; I just can’t.

## Chapter Twenty One

The road to Picketburg isn’t long, but half of it is under construction. That’s a shitload of construction.

The road isn’t bad though and when I get some cruising up it’s a nice meander around the mountain ranges, which have gradually become more and more interesting since crossing the border.

Despite it being a short day with nice sunshine and decent, distracting views, I never feel far from total panic.

I hate being on this bike. Every minute is a minute of feeling fucking terrible.

In actual fact, this ride is absolutely superb; most mountainous roads are.

Not long ago, a ride like this – this constant bending with no need for brakes but always rolling the throttle - would have had me grinning like an idiot, would have had me bouncing in the saddle and making stupid noises in my helmet. Like a happy moron.

Instead, I can’t wipe this tense grimace off my face. It won’t go. I’m so fucking wound up. And it’s a travesty. Just a wasted opportunity to enjoy what is one of the great rides of the trip.

Makes me feel even worse.

Instead of wishing this road would never end, I’m wishing the miles would pass faster, get me to Picketburg sooner. Instead of savouring it, I want to skip it.

Every minute the tension cranks itself.

---

By the time I roll into Picketburg my teeth are on edge and I’m borderline fucking frantic.

Picketburg.

This is it: the _final_ pit stop.

One stop from final destination.

I shack up at a B&B that’s basically just someone’s old house and they've given me one of the rooms. It's a bit weird to be living with a stranger. But they’re old so, yeah, no worries.

I head out for a late lunch and just for a meander. I feel the need to shake that morning off, somehow.

It just fucking clings to me.

Walking down the main drag of this tiny nothing town I come out of my own head and into the real world in a snap.

Something’s got my back up... and my skin crawls just a little...

I look about me. Despite the broad daylight, this place is _dodgy as fuck_.

Pissed drunk people everywhere with punters passed out on the pavement. Not pretty. At all.

_All eyes are on me_.

_All_ the eyes.

Not nice eyes either.

What the fuck is this about then?

I puff my chest out and make myself walk tall. I give my best “don’t you dare fuck with me” face. More like the “don’t even fucking think of talking to me, don’t fucking dare” face. It’s basically just a malevolent squint and a pulling at the corners of the mouth. “go ahead, punk, make my day”.

I’m _shitting_ it.

This has snuck up on me, bigtime, I never thought that after all the places I’ve been so far, that Picketburg would feel the dodgiest...

I’ve walked through the market quarter of Lagos, alone. I’ve been in the whore-houses of Monrovia, for fuck's sake.

It’s palpable. I can _feel_ these jokers sizing me up.

_Fuck this._

I quick step it to the local supermarket and calm down over a tub of yoghurt.

Crisis averted.

Note to self: Be behind locked doors before the sun sets.

---

After whittling away the sunlight hours in conspicuous places I come back to my room to stew my brain for the night.

Escapism doesn’t even do the job, while I eat my dinner of bananas and apples and more yoghurt, watching a movie, I can’t stop a tremor in my hands. It’s cold, but it's not _that_ cold...

I can’t write. Every time I try I feel like I’m going to slip over some _edge_, as though thinking too much is dangerous. I push it away.

I’m ratcheted to snap.

_In my heart, I know that I’m not going to make it_.

One half day. A quarter day, even. And that's it.

But I know that I’m not going to get there.

I can feel that it’s not going to happen.

Something will break.

---

I can’t sleep.

I don’t.

I’m exhausted, at the end of my tether, but my heart keeps smashing in my body. Enough that it makes my whole body wiggle while I lie in bed.

## Chapter Twenty Two

This is it.

I’m up before dawn.

I mechanically eat, putting food in my mouth, and I wait for the sun to come up.

There’s an old mirror on the wall. I look like I haven’t slept in weeks. Haggard. That beard... it doesn’t do me any favours...

I look like an addict of something.

Unwell.

Sick.

It hurts to look at myself.

My teeth are clamped down and the back of my throat is squeezing, the back of my cheeks pinching.

It’s time.

---

It’s freezing cold. _Bitterly_ cold.

It’s so foggy that the air has a density to it. A _thickness_. Like air soup.

It's twilighty pre-dawn. _I can’t see shit._

The gate at the end of the yard is obscured. Forget about seeing the house across the street...

But I have to go.

If I don’t go now I’ll stay.

And if I stay, well, I don’t know what would happen next...

The frozen, wet Shrike behaves. It always has.

It's been so damned good to me. We've gotten this far, together.

This is it. This is finally it...

I could cry.

I must be tired...

I hit the gears and we roll out, and away and towards the highway.

The wind-chill of the wet air is diabolical.

In the frosted, white air the glare from the cone coming out of my headlamp is almost counterproductive; I can barely even make out the road markings, and when a rare car comes the other way? Forget about it. _Totally blinded._

My only goal is to make sure that I'm not somewhere between those two oncoming beams of light.

---

I have to stop after ten minutes.

I’m not equipped for cold like this. Not even close.

These fucking fingerless gloves... My dead digits are saturated in icy dew. Wooden, corpse cold again.

Nothing I can do to warm up either. I’m numb to the bone and bloodless.

I get back on the Shrike and slog on.

---

After a half hour the dim light has turned into something less opaque.

The fog starts to get burnt off by the sunshine.

It’s still bloody cold; my fingers still don’t feel like they belong to me, but I’ll be alright.

I stop regularly, I check _everything_ on the Shrike.

My heart won’t stop smashing in my fucking chest, won’t give me a rest. It’s exhausting. I’m so tired of this.

---

Hours...

---

And then, Table Mountain.

_Cape Town_.

I ride into the city.

I'm watching myself, I want to savour the exact moment when it ends, know it, and note it; the moment when it leaves me; when I shed it off.

When it's _done_.

I ride through the streets till I get to the hostel I’ve booked.

I roll into the car park.

Pull up the Shrike.

Turn off the key.

I sit there in the quiet, in my helmet.

I feel _nothing._

I just sit there. Waiting for it. Waiting for the moment. And, nothing.

I feel the same.

Nothing’s changed.

It hasn’t fallen off me.

No happiness, euphoria, satisfaction.

No sense of achievement.

_Nothing._

I’m still _me_.

As I lean the bike onto the stand and swing my leg off, I know, that no matter what I achieve, no matter what the dream, no matter how _hard_ it was to get, no matter the sacrifice, no matter what I do, I’ll always be me.

Me. In _this_ sack of skin. In _this_ brain.

It doesn’t matter what I do, there’ll _never_ be another option.

Unescapable.

Here I am; I’ve done something that I never ever _ever_ dared to think I could ever do - and I feel _absolutely nothing_ about it.

What possibility is there in a life like this?

Nothing will ever be good enough.

I unload the Shrike - for the last time - and shack up.

In what should have been my greatest triumph, I'm at my most disappointed.

Staring into the abyss.

I never, ever, _ever_ have to ride a motorbike _ever_ again _for the rest of my life_. I really thought that that would be it; that once I didn't have to ride anymore that things would go back to normal. I thought that was what _it_ was waiting for; the end.

Yet, obviously not.

_It’s_ not that at all, then...

_Then what is it??_

Part of me wants to investigate this new detail about _it_, about these _episodes_, and what it means that it's not related at all to the ride... but that feels like dangerous territory... Places better left alone.

## Chapter Twenty Three

I do nothing.

_Weeks_ of _nothing_.

I can’t...

The sphere of things I can do without having problems is shrinking more and more, every day.

Every time I step out of the sphere I feel like I’m going to collapse. The world spins around me and I go out of control.

It’s terrifying.

Today I was doing my laundry - a hop, skip and a jump from the hostel - and I felt like I was about to blackout. All I was doing was watching the dryer go round and round, and I swooned in my chair like a drunk. Lurching up to my feet, I stumbled back to the hostel to lay down in my bed - my only safe place - and left the washing behind...

Yesterday, I was out having a coffee and reading a book when _it_ happened. I was trying so hard to read the words - just _read the words_ - but I couldn’t. The page didn’t make sense. Like my brain was at 1% capacity.

Can’t... read...

I felt like I was going to fall off my chair. The _need_ to get back to the hostel, back to my bed, was utterly overwhelming. When confronted with a line at the cafe's paying counter I skipped to the front, threw them ten times what the coffee was worth, and without waiting for change quick stepped it back to the hostel and to my bed.

If I can’t do laundry, if I can’t even read a book, how will I get back home? If I can't do the simplest of tasks, how will I catch _two_ planes??

More and more I think that it’s going to be more likely that my family are going to have to fly over here to help me back, or else they’re going to have to put me in a hospital here for people sick in the head.

I can’t see me getting home under my own steam.

That said, the other night I went out and had some drinks with some French backpackers from the hostel. We drank a fair bit... and I felt _better_.

For a couple of hours I felt like me again. _Normal_ me.

_I wasn’t scared_.

It was a blissful window of normality. I was chatty and friendly and having fun. A brief respite from the constant feeling of terror; the _always there_ feeling that something is about to go wrong; the feeling that I'm very not ok. _Gone._

A slippery slope, that one... and I know exactly where it ends. The once confusing world of alcoholism makes perfect sense now; it works.

I don’t drink again.

I shave my face. It’s a lot of beard; a years’ worth, maybe, which, when you look at it, is pretty damn pathetic.

I didn’t care how I looked for the whole of the last year through Africa, but now, here, I'm suddenly self-conscious. I care again. Backpackers will do that...

I’ve been sleeping twelve hours a day.

Sleep: It’s the only place I feel normal. Or, at least, the only place where I’m getting a break from _it_. Sleep; my only sanctuary.

Lots of it.

A normal day I’ll get out of bed at eleven or twelve o'clock (after waking up and forcing myself back to sleep four or five times.) Breakfast of muesli at the hostel. Take a shower, which brings on _it_ for some reason - like my body is somehow outside itself, and my brain is trying to keep up, just swooning around on the spot. Never still. Showers are the worst, they scare the shit out of me.

I fucking hate it.

It’s like when you step onto an escalator that’s not moving, and it feels really weird for a half second. It’s just like that, but _always_. Every second, I'm walking around on a broken escalator.

Then a few hours of staring at rectangles. Then lunch at a rotisserie sushi place down the road from the hostel. Then back to the hostel for more rectangles. Then off to get some dinner, which is invariably from the circuit of close-by fast-food chicken or fish and chips or some Thai food place. Then back to the hostel for even more rectangles till somewhere around midnight when I go to sleep for another twelve hours.

I’ve seen practically nothing of Cape Town.

I know it’s a travesty, because from the little I’ve seen, it’s an unbelievable place. Like, _jaw dropping_ unbelievable. But the cue is in the rack. I’ve seen enough. I’m basically killing time as best I can till I get clearance from Australian Customs to ship the Shrike back home.

Till then, I need to stay as safe as I can. I'm holding all my reserves in wait, so that I can get on that plane, and get home.

It's all that matters. I need my family.

## Chapter Twenty Four

The sphere has shrunk to zero.

_This is it_.

I'm in my bed, my safe place, I've just woken up, and I'm _shaking_ - violent as epilepsy - from head to toe.

I can’t stop it.

_This is it_.

This is where it ends.

I try to make my body like a board, tensing up - to make it stop - but it’s completely out of control.

I shake and shake and shake and _I can’t stop it_.

I’m panicking. And it gets worse, I shake harder.

I shake till it hurts.

It keeps hurting...

Then it’s over...

It comes off.

_I need to leave_. I can’t stay another day. Not another _second_.

Or I won’t make it home...

I get out of bed and I’m still getting aftershocks. My hands won’t behave.

I book a flight for 4pm. _Today._

_Now._

Cape Town – Johannesburg. Johannesburg – Home.

I pack my stuff. Give away my tent and my padlock and a few bags to a young bloke at the hostel who, after hearing my stories, reckons it’s a good idea to ride a motorbike through Africa. He’s even bought a cheap Chinese piece of shit that’ll do just fine. Good on him. Anyway. After handing on the baton to him, I grab a taxi.

My protégé gives me the finger and a smile as we pull away. I have to smile. Charming lad.

I sit in and try to hold it together.

---

Airport.

All I need to do is hold it off till I make it onto the second flight... Well, half way through the second flight... Well, however far the plane needs to go so that they won’t turn it around and head back to Johannesburg when I start shaking and losing it.

_I can’t stay in Africa._

I can’t let them hold me back. All I need to do is keep the lid on till then... Second flight...

Breathe. Just breathe.

---

Boarding - Cape Town.

I’m ok...

My heart is smashing and my body is swooning and I’m panicking... But I'm ok...

Buckle your seatbelts.

All I need to do is sit here...

Just sit. Let the plane do the work.

---

Joburg.

I brush my teeth and buy a bottle of wine for the family.

Boarding...

Buckle your seatbelts.

Lift-off...

And that’s it.

Africa.

The Shrike.

Gone.

But I’m still me.

_Nothing’s changed_.

Epilogue

Home. In the airport.

I made it.

Taking a piss before picking up the bags, there’s an advertisement in front of my face while I relieve myself:

“I am the hot and cold flashes that confuse you when you’re already confused enough”

“I am the tightening in your chest”

“I am the snowballing worries that become an avalanche in an instant”

"You need to know anxiety to be free from it. #knowanxiety"

"BeyondBlue."

That all sounds very familiar...

This is way, _way_ beyond just anxiety though. This is a complete breakdown...

I go get my stuff. They let me back in the country despite my bags and my riding gear still being covered in shit from all the way back in the mud baths of the Congo, and despite Australia being the most highly strung country for quarantine on the planet, they wave me through. Not sure how I feel about that...

Cab.

---

Home.

Old home.

Two in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I’m not going to be able to get in; no one knows I'm back.

I knock on the door.

My younger sister answers the door and it’s weird.

Maybe it’s my face...

It's like neither of us knows quite what to do, it all feels a bit unnatural.

She seems more shell-shocked than surprised.

She was about to head out the door - kind of in a rush, probably late, if nothing’s changed - so off she goes and the house is just empty.

I lie on the floor, looking at the ceiling. On the carpet of the house that’s familiar to me.

This is _home_.

_I feel nothing_.

I was so sure that home would change everything...

But I’m still me. Same skin. Same brain. Same eyes.

_Nothing’s changed._

My silver bullet. A blank.

Nothing.

I lie on the floor for a few hours.

Dad gets home.

Shits his pants a bit - he wasn't expecting a grown man in the house - but once he realises it’s his son he gets very excited about it.

I don’t know why I was expecting everyone - including myself - to be emotional, but no one is. I’m not. In my head I thought it was going to be so much more. I think it’s my face; I must look like shit.

There's no tears, just surprise.

I reckon everyone’s just shocked.

---

Mum gets home to find me and dad talking in the kitchen. She’s confused for an instant, but then she recognises me.

Her face scrunches up and her body goes into a standing fetal position as she starts to sob and sag halfway to the floor.

It’s the only time I’ve cried.

It feels more like home now.

---

I tell them everything.

That I’m not ok. That I think I’m very sick.

They want to help but there’s nothing that they can really do.

Mum gets free access to social workers with her job, so we book me in for some of that.

Mum gives me a fistful of Valium and I sleep.

Nothing’s changed.

Except that I’ve lost my safe place; sleep has become rolling episodes of smashing heart, fizzing head and utter terror.

_It’s getting worse..._

I'm home, and it's not going to stop...

---

I go to the social worker. She listens to me while I spill my guts. _Everything_ comes out over forty minutes of me just giving it the verbal diarrhoea. I can’t stop talking till finally I feel like I’ve told her every factual thing about what’s been going on, anything that could be of value, every last detail.

I pause.

She tells me that I don’t have enough magnesium in my diet.

I’m going to black out...

_Magnesium_?? Is she fucking serious.

I tell her what I think of that...

But on the way home I go and buy the biggest bottle of magnesium tablets at the pharmacy I can find. I might as well be thorough... Can't hurt...

---

I look up online that _BeyondBlue_ thing I saw at the airport, and I identify with _everything_ that they say. Every fucking word.

So now I have a word for it. _I’m calling it_.

It’s _Anxiety._

I hate the word. It’s not appropriate. It’s too fucking innocuous for what _this_ is.

Being _anxious_ doesn’t sound anything like what I’ve got.

_What I am is fucking crook_.

Anxiety, to me, is when you’re a little stressed out, or nervous, or I don’t know... anxious... I've never thought it was a big deal.

It _should_ be called "the Death Spirals". Or "Standing Mortis". Or the "Oh-Shit-You're-Fucking-Dying syndrome". Or "Brain Paralysis".

Anxiety? Pffft... Needs a rebrand.

My _episodes_, they’re called _panic attacks._ Again, not strong enough.

But every word of _what it is_, the actual _what_ of anxiety and panic attacks, resonates with me in a way that _I know that this is it_.

What I’ve tried so hard to describe, it’s all here. That feeling...

I book in to see my doctor, because that’s what they tell me to do.

---

I can’t drive myself. Can't even get into a drivers seat.

So, mum drives me.

All the places I’ve been... All the miles through all that slog... Africa! _All of it_. And I can’t drive for fifteen minutes to get to the doctor just around the corner...

For fuck's sake.

What’s happened to me?

I’m sitting in the waiting room next to my mum. I haven’t done that in a decade. But, unlike a decade ago, I’m happy she’s sitting next to me.

“Luke Gelmi”.

I don’t recognise Doctor James. It's been half my lifetime since I've been here. I don’t reckon he recognises me either... He reckons I look like my dad. Spitting image, apparently.

After practising my speech with Mrs Magnesium I give Doc James the summary, and my self-diagnosis.

He reckons I’m right; It’s Anxiety.

That’s all.

Anxiety.

I don’t know if I believe it yet... Doc James doesn’t either. So, just to be sure, it’s a full battery of blood tests and a brain scan.

If that comes up clean, says Doc James, then it's Anxiety for sure, and we can treat Anxiety medically. Take tablets called "beta blockers". It’ll stop the symptoms.

"Don’t worry, you’re not unique - _it’s very common_ - and it’s very, very _treatable_."

Not arriving in Cape Town; not getting on a plane; not my family; not anything could give me relief. Finally. I have it. Relief. _It’s going to be ok_.

This is what I’ve looked for. Been _dying_ for.

Doc James is still talking...

"...can medicate but I'd recommend the non-medical course, which is getting therapy."

I don’t want to depend on tablets for the rest of my life just to be ok either... Therapy suits me to the floor.

Thank you, Doc James.

Coming out of the doctors, nothing’s changed, but everything’s different.

After months of guessing, of worrying, I have a name. It’s a thing, _it’s an actual thing that exists_, I’m not making any of it up, I have it, and I can get after it.

The feeling of utter fragility, that the slightest knock to my peace of mind could send me to the loony bin: Gone. Dispelled. _Dismissed_.

---

Blood tests done. Brain scan in one of those things that they tell people they’ve got cancer when the results come back from, done.

Brain scan reveals nothing...

No kidding...

---

I start going back into the world again; only my family has known that I've been back. I cried with mum on my first day back, I cry again with my best mate now. Seems right.

---

Doctor Kathy’s not a doctor, but she’s a _doctor_. Not "MD" doctor but PhD doctor. She's my therapist.

Everything’s been the same; symptoms haven't changed a bit, but the understanding - _the why_ - has changed my attitude entirely.

I’ve been catching up with friends. I’ve been telling everyone who will listen that I’ve got an Anxiety problem. I’ve been so scared that admitting that I had a problem would open the floodgates, unlock a box of insanity, but instead it's opened the floodgates like a release.

Every time I talk with someone, it’s like sharing with them a piece of the burden that I've been carrying all by myself. It’s a tiny piece - they wouldn’t even notice it - but for me, spreading it amongst everyone I know has made a difference.

I’ve been having raging, _heavy_ panic attacks. It still _feels_ like I'm dying. It's probably even worse than it's ever been. But it’s ok. All the terror associated with _that feeling_, the not knowing what happens next, has been taken away.

All I want to know is what is my plan of attack... Should I do what my head is telling me to do? Go somewhere safe? Or do something else... Defy the feeling that tells me that I need to be somewhere safe? What would make it better?

_I want to get better._

I head into Doc Kathy’s office still covered in a bit of sand from surfing this morning; I came straight from the beach.

I should call her Kath, and she doesn’t mind the sand...

Where’s the lie down couch? Where I lace my fingers over my chest and tell her about my childhood? Two plain chairs facing each other is not what I expected...

I sit, I tell her everything.

“Shit Luke, you don’t need magnesium, you need therapy!”

“Yes! Thank you!! _Shit_. Right?? _Magnesium._ Fuck's sake...”

By the time we’ve got to talking about magnesium the session - which run’s for an hour - is practically over.

She tells me that I’m not going crazy.

That I could walk into the mental asylum - _right now_ - and they’d say “you’ve just got Anxiety, get out of here”. They literally wouldn't let me in.

It’s a big deal that’s not a big deal.

_It’s going to be ok._

Panic attacks can’t hurt you. They come, they suck, they go. The body can’t support a permanent panic attack; it’s too exhausting. Ten minutes – absolute max.

So no matter how bad a panic attack is, understand that it won’t last, and that it can’t hurt you. That’s as bad as it gets.

When you do what the panic attack is telling you to do, you exacerbate it. You make it worse. If it’s telling you to run away, to hide, to find somewhere safe, if you do what it says it learns that that’s the correct response.

So, next time - whatever you’re doing when it happens - keep doing it. Just go on doing what you would have been doing had it not happened. Yes, it’s gonna suck, it’s going to feel fucking awful, but it can’t hurt you, and it doesn’t last. So, just keep doing what you were doing anyway, and watch it! _Watch_ your thoughts, follow your thoughts, what are they saying? See where they go, watch what your head is doing, don’t suppress anything, watch how it feels and how you think as it comes, watch the feeling as it stays a while, watch the feeling as it goes. Watch it all the way to the end.

And stop checking your pulse all the time...

Don’t look for signs that one’s coming.

Just live.

After our fifth session a month later, and talking about the practical application of what I’ve learnt, it’s time to go.

“I pronounce you, 'cured'”.

I kind of knew it. I knew it a few weeks ago, if I’m honest. But these sessions have been the highlight of the week. It’s like I’ve been overflowing for months and months with the need to share _everything_ with someone. It’s weird, but I think I’m in love with Kath.

Nothing’s changed. I'm still me.

_But everything’s different._

---

Right.

What now?

I've taken all of the jenga out of my life... I guess it's time to start a new game... But first...

The Shrike.

THE END
