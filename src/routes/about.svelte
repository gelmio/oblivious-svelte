	Alternate Title: How [not] to ride through Africa on a Royal Enfield.
</h1>
<section class="prose prose-lg mb-10">
	<p>So, <em>what's the story then?</em></p>
	<p>Essentially, it's a story of things getting out of hand...</p>
	<p>A fairly simple idea just evolved into something that was book-worthy. I still don't really know how it happened...</p>
	<p>It started off with quitting my job, quitting my girlfriend and fucking off on a one way ticket to London.</p>
	<p>From there, I headed straight to the local Royal Enfield dealer and grabbed one of those.</p>
	<p><em>Why wouldn't you?</em></p>

	<p>Already, I thought this shit was <em>wild</em>.</p>
	<p>I surprised myself by riding all the way to the northernmost point of Scotland. Then, before I knew it, I was already down to the southermost point of Spain, <em>shitting</em> myself as I looked across <em>The Strait</em> to Africa...</p>
	<p>From there, well, I guess that's the real story; <em>Africa.</em> On a fucking Royal Enfield...</p>
	<p>I never planned a moment of any of this; I sure as shit didn't plan on riding though Africa, otherwise my choice of vehicle would have been more sensible. But there I was. And then what happens next is what happens next...</p>
	<p>I don't want to give the game away for those who haven't read any of the Trilogy yet (it would be retarded to spoil my own book, wouldn't it?)</p>
	<p>So, what can I say?</p>
	<p>I can tell you that it was a fucking long ride.</p>
	<p>I can tell you that a couple of times I thought I was going to die. That's something, isn't it?</p>
	<p>I can tell you that I killed a guy.</p>
	<p>I can tell you that I spend more time on <em>the throne</em> than I care to mention.</p>
	<p>I can tell you that the Enfield was a beast.</p>
	<p>I can tell you that Africa is fucking <em>bananas</em>.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Is that enough? Have I sold you on this yet? It's hard for me to tell you what you'll like about the book without knowing what you're here for...</p>
	<p>If you're here for adventure, you've got it in spades.</p>
	<p>If you're here to for a laugh, you'll get some of that.</p>
	<p>If you're here for romance you'll get none of that.</p>
	<p>If you're here for a good yarn; sit back, and let me take you on the ride.</p>
