			<h3>Chapter One</h3>
			<p><em>Just book the fucking ticket.</em></p>
			<p><em>The rest should take care of itself.</em></p>
			<p style="text-align: center">♦</p>
			<p>My moment came when I was taking an ultra-extended, double-lunch-break from my job.</p>
			<p>No one will notice I'm gone. If they do they'll think I'm at a meeting...</p>
			<p>I’m out of the skyprison and walking through the Supreme Court Gardens. I never come here; it’s too far away from work. My feet have aimlessly dragged me out here anyway - with eyes glazed over. In fact, I’m not even sure that these <em>are</em> the Supreme Court gardens...</p>
			<p>Anyway. It’s a glorious day; there’s just the right amount of fluffy cloud in the sky, the grass is green, so too are the trees. The lake is blue. There are ducks. It’s all quite picturesque.</p>
			<p>There is, however, a thorn sitting in amongst the roses, standing out like dogs balls, crapping on my oil painting.</p>
			<p><em>A scruffy looking homeless lad on a park bench.</em></p>
			<p>He’s just chillin', taking the air.</p>
			<p>He’s got a big, fat backpack sitting beside him that looks like it’s had a hard life and is well and truly on the way out.</p>
			<p>He’s too <em>ragged</em> to be a traveller, but not quite <em>clapped-out</em> enough to be homeless...</p>
			<p>He’s an odd <em>goldilocks</em> between backpacking and hobo; like an intrepid destitute.</p>
			<p>Which is he? I can’t cog it...</p>
			<p>And it bugs me. <em>I need to know.</em></p>
			<p>I want to go and ask him, but I figure that in either case it’d be a little offensive.</p>
			<p>Plus, he seems to be quietly at peace, and I don’t want to kill his vibe...</p>
			<p>Then it hits me - right between the eyes - and makes my face scrunch up.</p>
			<p>Not the smell...</p>
			<p><em>A thought...</em></p>
			<p>Again,  I can’t cog it... Here’s me, in my ironed shirt and fancy pants and shiny shoes, and over there is Marco Polo's arsehole. <em>And he’s having a better day than I am.</em></p>
			<p><em>I’m bloody sure of it.</em></p>
			<p>Just <em>look at him</em>... He's got two fifths of sweet-fuck-all, and I’m deadset certain that he’s enjoying himself, out here, in the sunshine, on his park bench, contemplating various duck oddities, more than I am, crunching numbers back at 'The Bad Place'...</p>
			<p>Then it hits me again, like a fucking freight train: <em>I’d swap places with the guy.</em></p>
			<p>I’d do it.</p>
			<p><em>I’d do it right now;</em> He can go back to 'The Dream Job', and I’ll hang out here and watch the ducks...</p>
			<p style="text-align: center">♦</p>
			<p>I pass the second half of the double-lunch-break on the park bench over from <em>Marco</em>. I've been trying to do what he does... Pretty simple.</p>
			<p>My hobo-cum-traveller decides to lie down and take an afternoon kip...</p>
			<p>So yeah, <em>he’s probably a hobo...</em> And I’m not sure I can take the copycat routine that far...</p>
			<p>But it doesn’t matter. The damage is done. <em>The seed is planted.</em></p>
			<p>I walk back to the chain-gang with a sense of purpose, and do something entirely irrational.</p>
			<p>Ticket: <em>booked</em>.</p>
			<p>Booked for an insane length of time into the future, but it's booked. <em>Done.</em></p>
			<p style="text-align: center">♦</p>
			<p><em>Blink.</em></p>
			<p>The 'insane length of time into the future' is <em>now</em>.</p>
			<p><em>It went that fast.</em></p>
			<p>I blinked, I nearly missed it...</p>
			<p>I've taken enough <em>jenga</em> pieces out of the tower of my life to bring the whole fucking thing crashing down. <em>A messy pile.</em></p>
			<p>But now I can start a new game...</p>
			<p>In the blink of an eye the girlfriend got dumped, the job got quit, the rent got canned, the car got cubed, freshly obsolete stuff got sold in a fire-sale, mildly sentimental stuff got dumped at my parent's place, a bag was packed, the bank was informed, drinks were drunk and <em>that was it.</em></p>
			<p style="text-align: center">♦</p>
			<p>Waiting in line to board the plane, the mad head-rush of excitement from the last few days washes off, and all that's left is the thought of how <em>easy</em> that was.</p>
			<p>Seriously, a cakewalk. It all just <em>dissolved</em>.</p>
			<p>Dissolved...</p>
			<p><em>Fuck...</em></p>
			<p>I’ve just dissolved my life...</p>
			<p>Shit...</p>
			<p><em>Shit!</em></p>
			<p>This is a mistake.</p>
			<p><em>Fuck.</em> This is a <em>massive</em> mistake!</p>
			<p><em>What am I doing??!</em></p>
			<p>As I completely shit my pants, the lovely air hostess with the big smile and overly red lipstick takes my ticket and welcomes me aboard.</p>
			<p>I must look like I'm fucking <em>insane...</em></p>
			<p>But it’s all too late to undo...</p>
			<p>Even after the duck pondering it was already too late; there was no going back.</p>
			<p>The whole thing has dragged me along by my bootstraps to <em>seat 33A.</em></p>
			<p>Buckle your seatbelts...</p>
			<p><em>We’re fucking off.</em></p>

			<p>I’m done with Monrovia.</p>
			<p>So done.</p>
			<p>Another night spent on <em>the can</em> in that fucking filthy cave of a bathroom in this shitpile of a demi-brothel.</p>
			<p>I dare not eat anything substantial. Biscuits and bananas are about all I can stomach.</p>
			<p>As if I didn't look shit enough already, all of my burnt skin from 'River No.2 Beach' has decided it’s going to flake off, so now my whole body and face look poxy.</p>
			<p>Lovely.</p>
			<p>Being crook is exhausting, and the lack of food, energy and sleep is starting to show.</p>
			<p>I don’t really care. I just want to get out of here.</p>
			<p>I head out for breakfast. It's another public holiday... I don’t know what for and I don’t particularly give a shit; all this means to me is that there won’t be any breakfast this morning.</p>
			<p>And that’s not good.</p>
			<p>I feel totally spent and the day hasn’t even started yet. I drag my feet when I walk. I'm all stooped over and old looking.</p>
			<p>I really don't want to, but I reckon it’s probably a good idea to stay for one more night. If there’s no food in Monrovia, then what chance do I have of getting lunch on the road? And what if the next stop, <em>Buchannan</em>, is all closed up too? What about accommodation? What about petrol? Will the petrol stations be open on a public holiday?</p>
			<p>Who cares.</p>
			<p><em>I just can't do it anymore.</em></p>
			<p>I’ve got to get out of here. I don’t care if I have a shit day of it, I want out. I refuse to spend another night in this shithole.</p>
			<p>Loading the bike takes everything I have left.</p>
			<p>I ride out.</p>
			<p>So long, Monrovia, you’ve been bloody awful.</p>
			<p class="text-center">♦</p>
			<p>The city is covered in an eerie, dense fog. It’s morning, but not that early, and regardless of the time, this is the first I’ve ever seen fog in Africa.</p>
			<p>Ominous.</p>
			<p>I’m no weatherman, but what I’m taking from it is that fog + time = rain, and rain + dirt roads = mud, and mud does not equal fun. In fact, just plain old rain does not equal fun on a motorbike; not to mention that my saddlebags are so beaten up they’d be about as waterproof as a sieve.</p>
			<p>I sit at a set of traffic lights, still technically inside Monrovia. I muse over the chance of a wet-season coming soon.</p>
			<p>Two policemen pop up out of nowhere, right in my fucking face.</p>
			<p>“Papers, <em>now</em>!!”</p>
			<p>I jump in my seat.</p>
			<p>They’re in <em>full</em> riot gear.</p>
			<p>All in black.</p>
			<p>They look like an African SWAT team.</p>
			<p>Shields, armoured body gear, the whole nine yards.</p>
			<p>They’ve come from a police post at the side of road that I didn’t spot coming into the red light. There's a handful of hardcore cops milling about over there, watching.</p>
			<p>I leave the bike running and hand them my UK rego papers; it's all I've got.</p>
			<p>They’re as confused about these as everyone else is when I hand them over; no one seems to ever be sure what exactly they’re looking at. But it looks <em>very</em> official...</p>
			<p>“Where is your permit?”</p>
			<p>My mate Uncle Sam has fucked me.</p>
			<p>The lights go green. And all the cars backed up behind me go fucking berserk. Beautiful.</p>
			<p>“This is my permit. See?”</p>
			<p>“No. You are under arrest.”</p>
			<p>Bam! The other cop - the short one - grabs my keys out of the ignition, killing the bike, and shoves them in his pocket in one swift movement.</p>
			<p>“Oi! Hey! Give those back!”</p>
			<p>“No! You are under arrest!”</p>
			<p>Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p>
			<p>“No... No I’m not. I’m not under arrest. Why do you think I’m under arrest? What for?”</p>
			<p>“You have no permit, you are under arrest!”</p>
			<p>This short one seems to be a little dim...</p>
			<p>"Bring the bike over here", the tall one gestures at the side of the road side. The cars behind me are going apeshit; they’ve missed the green light...</p>
			<p>What choice do I have? Gotta do it.</p>
			<p>Leverage lost, I try the usual arguments that the registration is fine, I don’t need a permit. I’m allowed to be here. “You go and ask Uncle Sam, the boss-man at the border, <em>big</em> boss-man, you ask him, the boss-man, he says 'No embarrassment', you ask!”</p>
			<p>That throws them...</p>
			<p>The short one, a little baffled, picks up his go-to line “You are under arrest! Yes, embarrassment!”</p>
			<p>I’m too tired; my thick brain can't come up with anything clever...</p>
			<p>A small, plain clothed man comes up to me from out of a growing crowd on the sidewalk, and starts telling <em>me</em> what the problem is.</p>
			<p><em>Who the fuck is this guy??</em></p>
			<p>According to him, it's not a problem that I don't have a temporary import permit for the bike. No. <em>The problem</em> is that motorbikes aren't allowed on this road without a <em>special</em> permit.</p>
			<p><em>What?!</em></p>
			<p>“Who are you??” I ask him. I'm totally out of patience. “Are you the police?? Huh??”</p>
			<p>To that he whips out an ID card.</p>
			<p>I lean in and squint. I’m talking to... <em>Colonel Williams</em> of Liberian fucking Immigration.</p>
			<p><em>What???</em></p>
			<p>Am I supposed to fucking believe that? That a <em>Colonel</em> just happened to be passing by? On foot?</p>
			<p>I smell a rat.</p>
			<p>The fattest of rats.</p>
			<p>This is a stich up. It’s gotta be...</p>
			<p>But the ID, well, it <em>does</em> look legit...</p>
			<p>I take him on face value, "I don't get it. It's a road. I shouldn't need a permit."</p>
			<p>"Do you see any other motorbikes on this road? Eh? No. And look," the Colonel points to the corner of the intersection "you see all those scooter taxis, they wait there, off the main road, because they don't have a permit"</p>
			<p>There's a handful of scooters with riders just sitting on them, doing nothing, going nowhere on the corner of the main drag...</p>
			<p>While I look at that, the riot police have pulled over some other poor bastard on two wheels.</p>
			<p>He looks <em>terrified.</em></p>
			<p>He frantically pulls out from under his shirt a laminated A4 sheet of paper that is roped around his neck.</p>
			<p>I’m not making it up; it's an enormous permit, laminated, hung from around his neck, stuffed down his shirt.</p>
			<p>I take a closer look.</p>
			<p>It looks legit. Some sort of permission granted for using a scooter or motorcycle on the main road. Stamps and everything.</p>
			<p>I scan my memory for motorbikes I’ve seen on this street in Monrovia. Not a single one comes to mind. And it's Africa, they should be everywhere...</p>
			<p>"You are under arrest!!"</p>
			<p>Fuck. That might be right...</p>
			<p>No one ever told me about this. How the fuck was I supposed to know?</p>
			<p>Ugh.</p>
			<p>I’m so <em>tired.</em></p>
			<p>“Can I have my keys back?”</p>
			<p>“You are under arrest!”</p>
			<p>It’s time to change tack, and fast.</p>
			<p>“Hey guys, ummm, do you know how I can get to Buchannan? Which way is it, you know, without using the wrong roads? Is it down this way?”</p>
			<p>It’s a dumb thing to ask and completely off topic.</p>
			<p><em>Everyone</em> wants to help me with directions. They all start talking over each other, finishing each other’s sentences to explain it to me. I’m getting advice from tall cop, short cop and my mate the Colonel. Even passer-by’s are throwing in their two cents. They're giving me directions on how to get <em>all the way</em> to Buchannan, like, 150 clicks worth of directions.</p>
			<p><em>This is going to work.</em></p>
			<p>I mirror back to them their own directions, and everyone’s all smiles and nodding and thumbs up.</p>
			<p>“Great, thank you so much guys, I really appreciate it. Can I grab my keys?”</p>
			<p>Short n dim actually gives me my keys back! This is going to work! What a gambit!!</p>
			<p>“Thanks again”</p>
			<p>I fire up the bike and it roars to life. I can <em>see</em> the moment it snaps everybody out of their well-wishing hypnosis they were under.</p>
			<p>“You are under arrest!!”</p>
			<p>Arrrrghh, <em>fuck</em>!!</p>
			<p>So friggin close!</p>
			<p>“Come on man, I’m just a simple traveller, how am I supposed to know about this, it was an honest mistake. Just let me off this time. Give me a break.”</p>
			<p>I look pleadingly to my mate the Colonel, who I’ve decided is on my team, but even he seems to be out of his league, or at least out of his jurisdiction: This is a police matter, and the Colonel of Immigration doesn't hold court here, it seems.</p>
			<p>He shrugs his shoulders and wishes me good luck and off he goes, walking back into the mob thats formed; the one guy in my corner and I’ve lost him.</p>
			<p>The riot cops tell me to go and park over on the other side of the road next to their checkpoint, where the rest of the hard looking cops are.</p>
			<p>I’m so hungry.</p>
			<p>I wonder if I threw up all over everyone if they’d let me leave, or if that would make things worse.</p>
			<p>Or maybe I could crap my pants.</p>
			<p>I reckon I could do either of the two, on cue. <em>Right now.</em></p>
			<p>They’d <em>definitely</em> let me go if I squirted brown everywhere. <em>Pronto.</em></p>
			<p>"We are taking the bags, and the bike. You are going to prison. You are under arrest." Tall cop says it, with solemn finality.</p>
			<p>Nothing happens. I just sit and on the bike and wait.</p>
			<p>Hunger and exhaustion start to turn the vice.</p>
			<p>The mob have crossed the road to continue to gawk, like this is some sort of spectator sport.</p>
			<p>The riot cops tell them to move on, but they refuse, shouting at the cops, who are shouting back.</p>
			<p>The cops start shoving people. The people shove back.</p>
			<p>Batons are brandished, the shouting ratchets.</p>
			<p>What the <em>fuck</em> is going on??</p>
			<p>I’m shitting it. I need to get the fuck out of here...</p>
			<p>The mob scuffles with the cops.</p>
			<p>Everyone's <em>screaming.</em></p>
			<p>One of the cop cracks a bloke on the arm with a baton, and the mob scatters; fucking bolts for it as the cops chase them off.</p>
			<p>I’m at the end of my tether.</p>
			<p>Either they'll put me in prison, or they want a monster bribe.</p>
			<p>What would I pay to get out of here? They sky’s the limit.</p>
			<p>I'll pay all I've got, and I've got all that money that I took out just a few days ago. An even thousand. I'd give it all just to leave.</p>
			<p>How do I even start that conversation? I haven’t the slightest idea and my brain isn't fucking working right.</p>
			<p>I’ve never done this shit before.</p>
			<p>What worries me the most about suggesting a bribe is that it could be used as further leverage against me, digging me deeper into the hole. I don't want another charge on the rap sheet...</p>
			<p>I decide to do nothing; it seems the least worst option.</p>
			<p>I'm actually pretty proud of myself for my outer composure; despite being ready to meltdown on the inside, on the outside I must look bored.</p>
			<p>I really hope I do.</p>

			<p>On the way to Immigration I grab four stodgy bottles worth of fuel. The bloke pours it through <em>a food strainer</em>and into my tank.</p>
			<p>Righto...</p>
			<p>The Immigration office is dimly lit, and the bloke manning it is a different guy. I sit down and we get to it.</p>
			<p>I give him my papers, and I cop the <em>exact</em>same rigmarole from him that I copped from the blokes at the border.</p>
			<p><em>The visa is no good</em>.</p>
			<p>We’ve been through this. I don’t need this again...</p>
			<p>The two of us make the same circular arguments over and over and over again.</p>
			<p>Somewhere in the vicinity of an hour passes, and he's getting shitty. He's not the only one...</p>
			<p>The aggressive wanker starts filling out some sort of form that I never asked for, and then says "give me money".</p>
			<p><em>Fucking great...</em></p>
			<p>He tells me the form costs twenty dollars to fill in. I want to tell him to go fuck himself. Instead, I tell him I have no money.</p>
			<p>It's a great card to play. What are they going to do? Deport me?</p>
			<p>I pull a shitty 1000 CDF note out of my pocket – about a dollar’s worth - and tell him that this is <em>all the money that I have</em> until I can find a bank, knowing full well and good that there isn’t a bank in the village.</p>
			<p>This is <em>all I have</em> for my lunch today.</p>
			<p>This is bullshit. I mentally count my cash: I’ve got a fat wad of CDF’s in my other jean pocket, a king’s ransom in my inside jacket pocket, more money in my saddlebags outside, and [about seven hundred] U.S. dollars in my secret jacket pocket. I’m rollin’ deep.</p>
			<p>He keeps me around for a long time talking to "the chef" on the phone.</p>
			<p>I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that there’s no one on the other end of the line, that he’s just having a conversation with himself...</p>
			<p>I don’t think that he knows that <em>I</em> know the chef...</p>
			<p>When he's off the phone I tell him to get the chef in the building, and then go ahead and give as precise a description of the chef as I can.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, it’s “only a photocopy and no embarrassment”. I can leave.</p>
			<p>Is he shitting me?</p>
			<p>I’m happy and pissed off and confused all at once.</p>
			<p>Whatever.</p>
			<p>I jump on The Shrike. It won’t start...</p>
			<p>It makes noises like an old car trying to fire, but it won’t turn over.</p>
			<p><em>What the fuck?</em></p>
			<p>What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
			<p>I give it another go and it boots on the fifth or sixth turn, and blows a big plume of black smoke out its arse.</p>
			<p>Sounds crook...</p>
			<p>There are misfires everywhere. The Shrike's unhappy, and so am I.</p>
			<p>Air filter?</p>
			<p>Dunno.</p>
			<p>We make it to the other end of the village, and we're stopped by The Congo River.</p>
			<p>I thought it was going to be big, but I didn’t think it would be <em>this</em> big.</p>
			<p>It's <em>immense.</em></p>
			<p>The other riverbank is so far away that it’s shrouded out almost completely by the humid fog.</p>
			<p>It's as still as a lake...</p>
			<p>I sit and take in the view while I wait for the barge to get going.</p>
			<p class="text-center">♦</p>
			<p>An hour and a half later and it's finally time to start loading up the barge.</p>
			<p>It's past lunchtime by the time we get to the other side of the river.</p>
			<p>The Shrike won't start. Again.</p>
			<p>Eventually it turns over enough and blows black out the back.</p>
			<p>It's really not happy.</p>
			<p>I can tell that if I roll off the throttle to let it idle it'll conk out.</p>
			<p>It's <em>suffering.</em></p>
			<p>I roll off the throttle.</p>
			<p>The Shrike gives a few coughs and bangs and then dies...</p>
			<p><em>Yuck.</em></p>
			<p>Probably that fuel, right? That shitty fuel?</p>
			<p>What if it dies on the ride?</p>
			<p>It chews my head as I chew a banana.</p>
			<p>I hit the ignition again and when it finally fires I don't waste any time. We're off.</p>
			<p>I'm not going to take a break for the rest of the day if I can help it; the last thing that I want to do is to turn off the bike in the middle of nowhere only for it to refuse to start again.</p>
			<p>So, that’s going to be - minimum - three hours. Probably more.</p>
			<p>I’m not sure if I can do it.</p>
			<p>That's a <em>long</em> time in the saddle. That'd even be a long time to sit on a couch.</p>
			<p>It’s really hot and <em>really</em> humid.</p>
			<p>I’m already sore from the last week and last night’s hospital bed.</p>
			<p>I'm already tired.</p>
			<p>But what else can I do?</p>
			<p>The marathon begins.</p>
			<p>The road is practically the same as the one on the north side of the river, if not a little easier. There’s still hardly any people, traffic or villages. Nothing really.</p>
			<p>It’s going to be a lonely ride.</p>
			<p class="text-center">♦</p>
			<p>My arse is already telling me I need a break, and my throat is telling me I could really use a drink. It's only been about an hour. I ignore it.</p>
			<p>I'm bouncing up a hill, and I can sense...</p>
			<p>What <em>is</em> that?..</p>
			<p>Something’s not quite right...</p>
			<p>Something...</p>
			<p>I go cold all over.</p>
			<p>I lean my body over and take a look at what’s going on; but I already know.</p>
			<p>The back tyre’s got no air in it.</p>
			<p>None.</p>
			<p>Empty.</p>
			<p>It’s rolling and lolling and flapping away noisily.</p>
			<p>No. no no no no no no no no no no no no...</p>
			<p>I <em>swoon.</em></p>
			<p>Oh shit fuck no! Not again! Not <em>here.</em>..</p>
			<p>I pull up, and the shrike coughs and splutters to death by itself.</p>
			<p>Silence.</p>
			<p>I’m not sure I can deal with this...</p>
			<p>But. Well. I’ve got to. No choices. Get on with it.</p>
			<p>I know this should be an easy job.</p>
			<p>I know it, alright? It's ok...</p>
			<p>It’s just a tube change, it’s not rocket science, no big deal, right?</p>
			<p>Well, yeah. But no.</p>
			<p>Get started.</p>
			<p>The tyre is <em>hot</em> to touch. Jerk-your-hand-away hot. <em>Not</em> a good sign. Must’ve been riding on it for a long time for it to get that angry.</p>
			<p>Hope I haven’t fucked the tyre and the tube... If the tyre's fucked then I'm <em>definitely</em> fucked.</p>
			<p><em>“Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.”</em></p>
			<p>I look for signs of a puncture culprit, but find none.</p>
			<p>No dirty big nail this time.</p>
			<p>I take a quick squiz at my GPS.</p>
			<p>It looks like I’m almost perfectly stuck in between where I came from and the next village along; fifty kilometres forward, fifty kilometres backwards. And nothing in between.</p>
			<p>Figures...</p>
			<p>So, it’s up to me then.</p>
			<p>Well, no it’s not. If it’s up to just me then I’m a dead man; I need someone with an air pump.</p>
			<p><em>Shit.</em></p>
			<p>I do a quick stocktake of supplies. I’ve got a banana that I picked up on the boat, and a bottle of water.</p>
			<p>I ain’t gonna be jogging it in. Not <em>fifty</em> clicks.</p>
			<p>Well, maybe... I <em>have</em> done a fifty clicker before. But that sucked. Hard. And was under <em>much</em> better conditions. <em>I</em> was in much better condition... And it wasn't ripping hot and reeking humid.</p>
			<p>So, <em>no.</em> Nothing left to do but to cross my fingers and hope that someone eventually comes along. Other than that, I might as well get to work and do what I can.</p>
			<p>I wheel the bike around to face downhill so the bike will tip forward on the stand and let me work freely on the rear wheel.</p>
			<p>I’m sweating before I’ve even taken my shit off the back.</p>
			<p>My clothes are already starting to soak through in the dead air.</p>
			<p>The sound of a motor cuts through the silence...</p>
			<p>I stop everything and prick my ears up. It's a long way off...</p>
			<p>I wait.</p>
			<p>Sure enough, a big 4x4 comes rumbling past.</p>
			<p><em>Bizarre.</em></p>
			<p>He must’ve been up my arse this whole time, ever since the barge.</p>
			<p>The vehicle is packed with humans. I mean <em>packed.</em></p>
			<p>Swimming with them. I can’t even do a headcount... Must be pretty fucking uncomfortable in there in this heat and humidity and all the bounding around...</p>
			<p>It’s obvious that the driver’s keen to move on. But I manage to hold him up for long enough to explain that I’ve got a puncture and no pump.</p>
			<p>He has a pump.</p>
			<p><em>Halleluiah</em>.</p>
			<p>He’s not going to stay to help me, he needs to leave now.</p>
			<p>Despair. I'm crushed. I don't know if I'll get this chance again... I beg him to stay for just a little bit.</p>
			<p>He can't. But he will sell it to me instead for twenty bucks.</p>
			<p>Deal. Fucking deal.</p>
			<p>That’s a great deal for him and a fucking saviour for me.</p>
			<p>Deal, deal, deal!</p>
			<p>Merci et au revoir, mon ami!</p>
			<p>The noise of the 4by fades, and now it really is all on me.</p>
			<p>I can do it.</p>
			<p>Out comes the wheel, which is less of rigmarole after learning my lessons a few days ago.</p>
			<p>It's not arduous, but the sweat is already dripping off the end of my nose like a leaky tap.</p>
			<p>Shit.</p>
			<p>I take a drink.</p>
			<p>This bottle isn't going to last...</p>
			<p>Time for the real work; getting that fucking tyre out of the rim again.</p>
			<p>Even with four hands and three irons I wasn’t sure we were going to get it last time.</p>
			<p>I don’t like my chances...</p>
			<p>But, then, it <em>has</em> to work. I have to make it work.</p>
			<p>The first three quarters of the tyre come out easily, but just like before it tightens for the last quarter, and won’t move.</p>
			<p>No matter what I do it won't lever out. Exactly the same as last time. It’s too tight. The bastard thing is designed to stay in that rim, and that’s exactly what it wants to do.</p>
			<p>Anything I lever out just slides right back into the rim again.</p>
			<p>It’s so <em>tricky!</em></p>
			<p>If I try to go further in to get at a bigger section of the tyre I just end up pulling so hard that I bend the metal. The tyre won’t budge a fucking millimetre.</p>
			<p>It’s hard, frustrating work.</p>
			<p>Not frustrating; <em>Infuriating.</em> That’s what it is. I want to take the wheel and hammerthrow it into the bushes.</p>
			<p>There’s no outsmarting this.</p>
			<p>I want to give up. But it's not an option.</p>
			<p>Sweat is drumming onto the tyre with a steady “doonk, doonk, doonk…” like a metronome.</p>
			<p>I’m going to snap.</p>
			<p class="text-center">♦</p>
			<p>I give up.</p>
			<p>I need a break.</p>
			<p>I go check my GPS for the time. I've been at it for something close to an hour...</p>
			<p><em>I can’t do it.</em></p>
			<p>I feel like I’m just pushing shit uphill. Smashing my head on a wall.</p>
			<p>My hands are blistered and filthy.</p>
			<p>Half the bottle of water is gone. My throat is tight with thirst. It's biting at the back of my mouth, but I don't dare take a drink.</p>
			<p>If another car ever comes by I’m going to get in.</p>
			<p>Leave everything.</p>
			<p>But what if a car doesn’t come?</p>
			<p>When do I start walking?</p>
			<p>Nah. It has to work. I’ve <em>seen</em> it done.</p>
			<p><em>It has to work.</em></p>
			<p>I get back onto the levers.</p>
			<p>I’m shredding up the tyre wall now. It doesn’t really matter if I ruin the tyre if I can’t get the tube out anyway. But, then again, there's no point in replacing the tube if I've destroyed the tyre.</p>
			<p>Fuck it.</p>
			<p><em>"Fuck you!!"</em></p>
			<p>I carve the fucker up.</p>
			<p>I carve and carve and it's a mess.</p>
			<p>The bastard pops out.</p>
			<p><em>Thank fucking Christ.</em></p>
			<p>I sit on the dirt floor and catch my breath and flex my fingers.</p>
			<p>I can see the wires or canvas or whatever that is that’s under the rubber on the tyre. <em>That can’t be good...</em></p>
			<p>Out comes the shitty busted Chinese tube.</p>
			<p>I pump it up and give it a good looking over. But I can’t find the puncture. It should be hissing air at me from <em>somewhere.</em></p>
			<p>It must be tiny.</p>
			<p>I look and look and look. It’s important. I <em>have to</em> find it. If I can find where the puncture is on the tube, that'll give me a ballpark area to look at on the tyre for the cause...</p>
			<p>Nothing doing.</p>
			<p><em>Nothing</p>. The tube is losing air but I can’t find where. I need water so that I can look for bubbles.</p>
			<p>But that ain’t gonna happen. I ain’t even going to spit on it.</p>
			<p>Bugger it.</p>
			<p>Get on with it.</p>
			<p>I tuck my old and re-patched tube into the tyre like tucking in a blanket.</p>
			<p>Even this has to be tricky.</p>
			<p>The prick of a thing is too fat to fit in between the rubber and the rim.</p>
			<p>It won’t slide in easy. I know I shouldn't, but I have to force it.</p>
			<p>It goes.</p>
			<p>Now, damn it, I’ve got to lever the tyre <em>back</em> into the rim.</p>
			<p>I step on half the tyre, just like Alfred did, and the tyre pops neatly into the rim.</p>
			<p>Good.</p>
			<p>At the three quarters in mark my feet and weight can do no more.</p>
			<p>Tyre iron time.</p>
			<p>Again, it’s fucking impossible.</p>
			<p>Once I reach “the crux” - that last quarter - I just can’t make <em>any</em> progress. The tyre refuses to obey, and obstinately bends the crap out of these pissy god damn mother fucker tyre irons.</p>
			<p>And it's even more risky than before, because now there’s a thin tube on the inside that if I accidentally catch between the tyre iron and the rim... well, I don’t even want to think about that...</p>
			<p>Point being, the job requires a huge amount of force, and I’ve got to, somehow, be delicate at the same time.</p>
			<p>Time passes. I work.</p>
			<p class="text-center">♦</p>
			<p>No progress.</p>
			<p>None.</p>
			<p>I’m gutted.</p>
			<p>Spent.</p>
			<p>Covered, saturated, in sweat – sweat that I’m not replacing.</p>
			<p>It keeps rolling into my eyes, stinging, and I can't wipe my eyes because of my filthy hands, covered in grease and dirt and blisters.</p>
			<p>Thirsty. Tired. Scared.</p>
			<p>The blisters on my hands explode.</p>
			<p>There’s flappy bits of stinging skin all over my hands, weeping whatever that is that blisters have. The blister fluid collects the red dirt off the ground, and the road grime off the tyres.</p>
			<p>The crushed thumb from a few days back has peeled right open.</p>
			<p>I’m in trouble.</p>
			<p>I can feel myself crapping out.</p>
			<p>My brain is slowing. I'm running out of kilojoules.</p>
			<p>The tyre pops in.</p>
			<p>I don't know how, but it gets past the impossible limit, and the rest of the tyre happily pops in, easy as you like.</p>
			<p>We’re done.</p>
			<p>I don't have anything left to even be happy.</p>
			<p><em>Get me out of here.</em></p>
			<p>I get out the air pump and work away at the plunger.</p>
			<p>The tyre inflates quickly, and before long it passes my thumb-squeeze pressure-test.</p>
			<p>I unscrew the pump off the valve as fast as I can; air hisses and escapes through the valve while it’s still attached.</p>
			<p>The valve comes off.</p>
			<p>But, there's still a little noise...</p>
			<p>What <em>is</em> that??</p>
			<p>I stick my ear onto the tyre...</p>
			<p>I can hear a tiny, <em>barely</em> audible hiss.</p>
			<p>Oh no...</p>
			<p><em>No</p>...</p>
