{"bookContents":["<p><em>Just book the fucking ticket.</em></p>\n<p><em>The rest should take care of itself.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>My moment came when I was taking an ultra-extended, double-lunch-break from my job.</p>\n<p>No one will notice I'm gone. If they do they'll think I'm at a meeting...</p>\n<p>I’m out of the skyprison and walking through the Supreme Court Gardens. I never come here; it’s too far away from work. My feet have aimlessly dragged me out here anyway - with eyes glazed over. In fact, I’m not even sure that these <em>are</em> the Supreme Court gardens...</p>\n<p>Anyway. It’s a glorious day; there’s just the right amount of fluffy cloud in the sky, the grass is green, so too are the trees. The lake is blue. There are ducks. It’s all quite picturesque.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a thorn sitting in amongst the roses, standing out like dogs balls, crapping on my oil painting.</p>\n<p><em>A scruffy looking homeless lad on a park bench.</em></p>\n<p>He’s just chillin', taking the air.</p>\n<p>He’s got a big, fat backpack sitting beside him that looks like it’s had a hard life and is well and truly on the way out.</p>\n<p>He’s too <em>ragged</em> to be a traveller, but not quite <em>clapped-out</em> enough to be homeless...</p>\n<p>He’s an odd <em>goldilocks</em> between backpacking and hobo; like an intrepid destitute.</p>\n<p>Which is he? I can’t cog it...</p>\n<p>And it bugs me. <em>I need to know.</em></p>\n<p>I want to go and ask him, but I figure that in either case it’d be a little offensive.</p>\n<p>Plus, he seems to be quietly at peace, and I don’t want to kill his vibe...</p>\n<p>Then it hits me - right between the eyes - and makes my face scrunch up.</p>\n<p>Not the smell...</p>\n<p><em>A thought...</em></p>\n<p>Again, I can’t cog it... Here’s me, in my ironed shirt and fancy pants and shiny shoes, and over there is Marco Polo's arsehole. <em>And he’s having a better day than I am.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’m bloody sure of it.</em></p>\n<p>Just <em>look at him</em>... He's got two fifths of sweet-fuck-all, and I’m deadset certain that he’s enjoying himself, out here, in the sunshine, on his park bench, contemplating various duck oddities, more than I am, crunching numbers back at 'The Bad Place'...</p>\n<p>Then it hits me again, like a fucking freight train: <em>I’d swap places with the guy.</em></p>\n<p>I’d do it.</p>\n<p><em>I’d do it right now;</em> He can go back to 'The Dream Job', and I’ll hang out here and watch the ducks...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I pass the second half of the double-lunch-break on the park bench over from <em>Marco</em>. I've been trying to do what he does... Pretty simple.</p>\n<p>My hobo-cum-traveller decides to lie down and take an afternoon kip...</p>\n<p>So yeah, <em>he’s probably a hobo...</em> And I’m not sure I can take the copycat routine that far...</p>\n<p>But it doesn’t matter.

Not much of an arm wrestle, really... <em>Anything</em> I asked for got thrown in to the deal: A set of crashbars, change the speedo to kilometres per hour (none of this imperial shit), first service for free, a copy of the Royal Enfield workshop manual, a back seat plus 'saddle bags', and a waterproof cover to put over the whole bike.</p>\n<p><em>And</em> a badass new leather jacket...</p>\n<p>I ride out of the dealership like I stole the thing.</p>\n<p><em>You couldn’t slap this grin off my face.</em></p>\n<p>I’m <em>brutally</em> happy.</p>\n<p>Happy as a pig in shit.</p>\n<p>This was a great choice...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Disaster.</em></p>\n<p>We <em>lurch</em>.</p>\n<p>The Enfield's powering down like someone turned the key off...</p>\n<p>I wring the throttle on and off. <em>Nothing...</em> It keeps winding down...</p>\n<p><em>It's only been a few hundred clicks.</em> Day one's not even in the books yet!!</p>\n<p>The red 'engine warning light' has flashed onto the speedo...</p>\n<p>We decelerate slower and slower...</p>\n<p>What the fuck's going on here? This is a new bike!!</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Piece of shit!!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>The Enfield roars back into life again, full power, accelerating.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;What the fuck was that??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>The Enfield just carries on like nothing happened...</p>\n<p><em>Jesus.</em></p>\n<p>I've made a big mistake. An <em>expensive</em> mistake...</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em> Why didn't I just buy something German, or Japanese?</p>\n<p>Fucking idiot...</p>\n<p>I pull over and call the dealer for a 'please explain'.</p>\n<p>They say it's likely an electrical fault...</p>\n<p>They assure me that if there's oil in the sump I can't break anything important... They'll fix the fault at the free service that I wrangled, due in five hundred clicks.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>They look surprised to see me...</p>\n<p>The fuck-up was yesterday. I've already chalked up the distance.</p>\n<p>I think I've broken a record...</p>\n<p>We do the service, which is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>I made it a condition of the purchase that I get to do the service <em>myself.</em></p>\n<p>They thought it was an odd request, but I <em>need</em> to learn stuff. I've even read 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', which was neither about <em>Zen</em> nor <em>motorcycle maintenance...</em></p>\n<p><em>False advertising.</em></p>\n<p>Anyway. The <em>service</em> part is basically just a changing of the oil and filters and stuff. Pretty straight forward, with supervision...</p>\n<p>Disturbingly, the oil and the filters are full of chunky bits of metal... Apparently that's 'normal'...</p>\n<p>Once the 'first service' stuff is out of the way, it's time to get down to fixing that 'fault'.</p>\n<p>My mate Kev the mechanic reckons it's a clogged 'injector', which, he explains, is the thing that sprays fuel into the cylinder.</p>\n<p>We get to work.</p>\n<p><em>The injector's a bitch to get at.</em> The whole fuel tank has to come off, and then it's <em>fiddle city,</em> with cables and hoses and wires all in the way of prying fingers.</p>\n<p>Once all that's out of the way, the injector unscrews out and the new one goes in, and it all has to be put back together the way it came apart...</p>\n<p>Takes an age...</p>\n<p>I'm in the final stages of the job. I've been attacking an <em>infuriatingly</em> tricky electrical plug for the last five minutes, when I see that another plug's been unclipped... <em>I don't remember doing that...</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Hey Kev?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Come have a look at this... Nah, in deeper... Can you see that plug? Did you unclip that?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ah, no... Not that one&quot; Kev scratches his head.</p>\n<p>&quot;Me neither.&quot; We spend a moment in silence...</p>\n<p><em>Click</em></p>\n<p>Kev and I share a look. &quot;Enfields are quirky...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You're not wrong, Kev.&quot;</p>\n<p>I put it all back together, I shake hands with Kev and the boys, and peel out.</p>\n<p>At the first crossroads I pull a small compass out of my pocket. It points north. <em>Sounds good to me...</em></p>\n","<p><em>It's so stupidly easy.</em></p>\n<p>Gloriously simple.</p>\n<p>I take a look at the map in the morning over breakfast, find a direction that looks interesting, set a bearing, and go.</p>\n<p>When I've got an option of different roads to take, I consult the compass while still rolling, and go with the option that best lines up with my bearing, no matter what the road looks like.</p>\n<p><em>It's never failed me.</em></p>\n<p>With no planned routes, I spend all of my time on wonderful one-and-a-half lane country roads, getting thoroughly, wonderfully lost in the British countryside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yet, at the end of every day, I always find myself within spitting distance of where I wanted to be.</p>\n<p>Half the time I land on it like a fucking homing pigeon.</p>\n<p>And if it doesn't work out, who cares? There's always, <em>always</em> somewhere to stay at the end of a long day in the saddle; hostels, hotels, b&amp;b's, camping, whatever; It's so bloody easy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>I love it to bits.</em></p>\n<p>Britain is <em>wonderful.</em></p>\n<p>I knock off three thousand clicks in twelve days.</p>\n<p>The lads at the dealership are definitely surprised to see me this time. If I didn't set a record for the first service, I definitely got it on the second.</p>\n<p>I paid for it too; my back is killing me and my arse is numb. Not that I care.</p>\n<p>In three thousand clicks there are fresh problems to solve on the Enfield. Easy ones, this time; the number plate fell off, the neutral light on the speedo stopped working, and the head gasket had started pissing oil...</p>\n<p>Easy fixes.</p>\n<p>Throw in a standard service and we're free to go again.</p>\n<p>Set compass: North.</p>\n<p><em>Again.</em></p>\n","<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I gone done a whole bloody lap of England and Scotland.</p>\n<p>It's been <em>nothing</em> like I expected. Outside of the big city centres, it's all so <em>green</em>, so <em>rural.</em></p>\n<p>When the sun's out and shining you'd be hard-pressed to top the United Kingdom for a ride...</p>\n<p>I love pies and warm beer and shitty fish and chips.</p>\n<p>I've been utterly surprised and delighted with all of it.</p>\n<p>I never want to leave...</p>\n<p>And I wouldn't.</p>\n<p><em>Except I have to...</em></p>\n<p><em>Winter is coming.</em> Hard.</p>\n<p>I've been copping it. Being on a bike in the drizzling rain is the pits. Fucking miserable.</p>\n<p>Discomfort aside, I even managed to crash the bike while being a silly dickhead in the Scottish Highlands. Thoroughly scared the shit out of me.</p>\n<p>I've never crashed a bike before. It was a bit surreal...</p>\n<p>I was leaning the bike over as far as it will go in the wet, and then a little further... The whole thing just <em>let go.</em> Couldn't recover the slide and hit the tarmac. The landing was about as hard as falling off a chair sideways.</p>\n<p>In that falling instant the bike felt so <em>heavy</em>. All two hundred kilos of it.</p>\n<p><em>Bang,</em> and the bike and I go pirouetting across the road and into the oncoming lane, bright orange sparks flying everywhere like an angle grinder.</p>\n<p>While sliding across my hip I'm thinking, clearly: 'remember this, <em>this is a crash.</em>'</p>\n<p>I got up shaking like a leaf. Checked to make sure I still had all my fingers.</p>\n<p>I did.</p>\n<p>A car came flying the other way while I picked up my bike. If they'd been a bit sooner, or me a bit later, it would have been messy...</p>\n<p>The old duck in the oncoming car jumps out and gives me a bottle of 'Lucozade'. Sugary drink. Apparently that helps with the <em>shock</em>.</p>\n<p>Damage to me and the bike was purely cosmetic. Bruises and some missing skin off the fingers for me, nothing a hammer couldn't fix for the bike.</p>\n<p>Honestly, with the amount of <em>Scotch</em> I drank at some of those Scottish distilleries... I was <em>very</em> lucky to get away from the UK so lightly...</p>\n<p>Anyway, point being: winter sucks...</p>\n<p>Which is why I have to leave.</p>\n<p>Which is why I'm in Dover. Which is a shithole.</p>\n<p>Right at the arse end of southern England.</p>\n<p>On the other side of <em>The Channel</em> is <em>France.</em></p>\n<p>I don't wanna go.</p>\n<p>I'm shitting my pants a bit about the crossing... I don't have the right papers for the bike...</p>\n<p>I had to cheat a little to get the bike insured/registered in England because I'm not a resident here. I don't even have an international drivers license... One quick check of my papers at the border and I'll be in the shit...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At the long line-up of vehicles for the ferry I do that dickhead thing that motorbike riders do and cut straight to the front.</p>\n<p>The bloke behind the perspex takes my ticket, scans it, looks at my passport, and gives it all back.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's it?&quot; He waves me on...</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>That was <em>easy.</em></p>\n<p>Lax, even...</p>\n<p>I roll the bike into the bowels of the ship. The Enfield sounds incredible in this enclosed space (I give it a bit of wrist... Shit yeah!)</p>\n<p>I ratchet-strap the beast down for the ride.</p>\n<p><em>Ta ta, England.</em></p>\n<p>It's been superb.</p>\n","<p><em>Dunkerque.</em></p>\n<p>How would you say that?</p>\n<p>Dunkerque...</p>\n<p>I've been saying dunker-cue.

Sounds like a fucking perfume...</p>\n<p>I know 'plomb' means 'lead'. One of those weird things you hear once and never forget...</p>\n<p><em>Sans?</em> I thought that was a <em>font</em>... Like, 'comic sans', right?</p>\n<p>Maybe 'sans plomb' means 'unleaded'. Which means 'essence sans plomb' is the go, and 'gazole' must be diesel...</p>\n<p>But that doesn't make sense either, because 'gazole' here is way, <em>way</em> cheaper than 'essence', which is arseways. <em>Again...</em></p>\n<p><em>Petrol</em> should be cheaper. Right?</p>\n<p>&quot;Fuck it!&quot; Essence Sans-Plomb. Done. I brim the tank and head inside to pay.</p>\n<p>&quot;Bonjour!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Bonjour... erm...&quot; I don't know what to say... <em>&quot;Essence??&quot;</em> I point outside at the bowser.</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Bar bar bar bar?</em>&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>From the inflection at the end, that was probably a question... I shake my head, confused. What question would she ask if this was all happening in English? 'How's your day?' This shouldn't be so tricky...</p>\n<p>&quot;Aaarrh...&quot; I hand her my credit card. &quot;Essence... <em>Essence?</em>&quot; I point again, like that's gonna help.</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Bar bar bar</em>&quot; she takes my card.

I feel like a petulant fucking child. But this <em>is</em> fucking serious!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I find a mirror and inspect the damage while everyone gets dressed.</p>\n<p>My lip is absolutely fucked. My front tooth has mangled it on the way through to the stone floor, hit that, and then cracked clean in two.</p>\n<p>There's a line running east-west right through the middle of my front tooth. Every time I touch it (and my tongue just <em>will not stop</em> playing with it) it sends lightning bolts up my head, enough to make me reflexively try to recoil my head away from itself.</p>\n<p>My mouth must be a septic <em>nightmare.</em> Vomit and alcohol and not brushing my teeth in over 24 hours isn't exactly a 'sterile environment...'</p>\n<p>I try to poke my grisly lip back down into place, like I might if it were my thumb, but it won't push down, it's too mangled and keeps sitting up like a piece of meat pie gristle.</p>\n<p>I'm never going to look the same again...</p>\n<p>“Fug.”</p>\n<p>Can they fix that?</p>\n<p>The bottom half of the broken tooth is <em>wobbly</em>, but it's still hanging on, still attached, probably by the <em>roots</em>.</p>\n<p>They <em>must</em> be able to fix it.</p>\n<p>Even the light pressure of my top lip is enough to move the bottom half of the tooth, which means I have to pout my lips out like a fucking duck, or blow up my cheeks like a fucking monkey to stop the contact.</p>\n<p><em>Why the fuck is everyone taking so long?</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Finally.</em></p>\n<p>They're ready to move.</p>\n<p>I don't have <em>any</em> sympathy for their hangovers.

My tongue just <em>will not stop touching that tooth</em>. It feels like it's hanging on by a thread...</p>\n<p><em>Wait...</em></p>\n<p>My other tooth...</p>\n<p>The <em>other</em> front tooth...</p>\n<p>I touch it lightly with my tongue.</p>\n<p><em>That doesn't feel right...</em></p>\n<p>That's not where it used to be...</p>\n<p>Finger confirmation.</p>\n<p>Yep. That's well and truly on the piss...</p>\n<p>Forced way back on a sickening angle.</p>\n<p>I've been focussing so much on that broken tooth that I haven't realised that I've knocked this one way out of joint.</p>\n<p><em>Jesus.</em> Instead of breaking like the other one did it just <em>bent</em>. How did I not notice that??</p>\n<p>Well... There's no easy way to do this...</p>\n<p>I put my thumb behind it.</p>\n<p>Ooookay...</p>\n<p>I pull it forward.</p>\n<p>Hard.</p>\n<p>Harder... My thumb shakes.</p>\n<p><em>I give it everything.</em></p>\n<p><em>Crunch.</em></p>\n<p>I <em>scream</em>... In my head.</p>\n<p>I've still got the tooth in my grip. I shove it up into my gums with all my force.</p>\n<p><em>Crunch.</em></p>\n<p>I make a noise like a wounded animal.</p>\n<p>My hand comes away shaking.</p>\n<p>This isn't <em>fair,</em> <em>I floss my teeth, for fuck's sake!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Hospital.</em></p>\n<p>Needle into my lip.</p>\n<p>Anaesthetic.</p>\n<p>Some <em>boy</em> intern has drawn the short straw, and gets to practice patching up the badly behaved tourist who smells like stale vomit.</p>\n<p>Needle pokes in, needle pokes out, needle pokes in, needle pokes out...</p>\n<p>Repeat.</p>\n<p>Again, and again, and again.</p>\n<p>No pain.

We won't know for a couple of weeks whether or not it'll survive.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Weegs?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, two weeks.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;An da ofver?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, that one will need a full rebuild with a zirconia crown, and a root canal. <em>It's a lot of work</em>. And if the other one dies, it'll need a root canal and a crown as well.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;O-gay&quot; <em>Fuck.</em> That's going to cost a fucking fortune.</p>\n<p>&quot;If we fit you for a zirconia crown now on the broken tooth, but then the other one dies, the two crowns won't perfectly match. It'll look funny. Does that make sense?&quot; I nod. &quot;Ok, so, you come back in two weeks and we'll do them both at the same time, then they'll be perfectly matched, and we'll send it to the factory to get made. Ok?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Bud whad do I do nao?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, I'll give you a temporary crown, but that'll have to wait till tomorrow, and we'll make you a mouthguard to protect your 'neighbour tooth', and hopefully it'll live.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ah. O-gay.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm out of the chair.</p>\n<p>Nothing's changed, except that he's yanked the bottom half of my tooth off... <em>That's it...</em></p>\n<p>There goes my perfect dental record.</p>\n","<p>Miserable.</p>\n<p>Walking around with a half a tooth missing and getting lightning bolts every time something touches it is the pits.</p>\n<p>Toothless hick.</p>\n<p>I didn't realise it straight after the fall, but I've broken my nose, and hit my head really hard - just to add to the rap sheet.

And cold as ice.</p>\n<p>Heavy and brutal, in seconds it's running down the back of my neck in rivulets, and under the back of my waterproof-onesie-riding-condom.</p>\n<p>I quickly lose the feeling in my fingers and toes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Half an hour of climbing.</p>\n<p>It comes down <em>harder.</em></p>\n<p>And <em>colder.</em></p>\n<p>I'm shivering, <em>violently</em>.</p>\n<p>Hands and feet turned to wood.</p>\n<p>It's fucking <em>stonking</em> down.

Now what?</p>\n<p>My fingers refuse to work. I can't get the waterproof pocket open on my jacket to get my phone out.</p>\n<p>My fingers; they just won't cooperate. And there's nowhere to get warm...

Faaaaaaaaaaaaark. Oh fuck it!!&quot;</p>\n<p>Woe is me.</p>\n<p>I sit, under a little overhang.

I walk in, wringing wet.</p>\n<p><em>At least it's warm...</em></p>\n<p>I ask the old duck behind the counter if there’s another hostel in the country. She just throws me an accommodation booklet. Like, <em>'you figure it out'</em>.</p>\n<p>Can't find any hostels, but there is an 'aine' which <em>seems</em> to be like a hostel... I ask the duck if she can make a phone call for me to make sure they have a bed available.</p>\n<p>Nope. Can’t do that. <em>It’s against the rules.</em></p>\n<p>Whatever.

Hallooooooooooo??&quot; My weird, mouthguardy voice echoes off the walls.</p>\n<p>Other than that, it’s dead silent.</p>\n<p>I poke my head into what looks like the old admin, and shit my pants: <em>there’s someone here.</em></p>\n<p>My saviour!</p>\n<p>He hasn’t heard me because he’s had his headphones in while he’s working on his computer.</p>\n<p>I ask for a room for the night.</p>\n<p>&quot;No, uh, booked. Complet.&quot;</p>\n<p>I look around. What??</p>\n<p><em>&quot;What??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Apparently, there's not a single bed available for the night.</p>\n<p>Neither his English nor my Catalan/Spanish are good enough to get a reasonable explanation of how that could <em>possibly</em> be true.</p>\n<p>It all feels like some sick joke.</p>\n<p>I <em>beg</em> him for a bed.</p>\n<p>Then grovel, <em>from my knees.</em></p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>Nothing. This arsehole doesn't budge.</p>\n<p>He turns me out, into the rain...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back to the bitch at the tourist centre.

I was cooking up some burritos and talking to one of the girls in a hostel when I very suddenly couldn’t concentrate on the conversation... Things went really dizzy all at once and I had to quickly grab hold of the kitchen bench to stop myself from falling over. My head went all fizzy and fuzzy as the room kept <em>spinning.</em></p>\n<p>I was sure I was about to black out.</p>\n<p>It all happened in a moment, and took me completely by surprise.</p>\n<p>It lasted maybe five seconds before things slowly started to come back to normal, but I continued to feel <em>weird.</em></p>\n<p>Either I handled it with aplomb, or the Yank wasn’t paying attention, because she didn’t seem to notice anything had happened…</p>\n<p>I’ve been analysing the shit out of it.</p>\n<p>Obviously something's caused it, but I’ll be buggered if I know what that is.

There's a gap between my front teeth that wasn't there before... They don't really <em>feel</em> like they're mine; they feel ginormous in my mouth.

I don't know when it happened, but I'm arm in arm with Shazza. We watch the waves roll in with the thump of the music from the club in our backs...</p>\n<p>The <em>other</em> Canadian strips off her clothes and sprints into the water. Ben the Australian - calm as you like - strips down and casually strolls in too. No rush...</p>\n<p>Our fearless leader from the hostel, a drop-dead gorgeous, born-again hippie with thick red hair like something out of a fucking <em>shampoo commercial</em>, takes off her loose fitting summer dress in one smooth movement like something from a fucking dream. She <em>catwalks</em> into the white wash.</p>\n<p>Who knew she hadn’t been wearing underwear <em>this whole time...?</em></p>\n<p>Sweet baby Cheeses...</p>\n<p>Shazza has to pick my jaw up off the floor for me. Like a fucking cartoon. She's not even mad…</p>\n<p>After the necessary drunken frolic the whole motley crew head back into the club, covered in sand and dripping wet.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> going to be a good night...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The mob thins out to me, Ben the Australian, and the two Canadian girls.</p>\n<p>In a moment alone, I kiss Shazza. She seemed to like it. I <em>still</em> can't believe it... Maybe she has a fetish for guys who look like they've been in a hockey fight? I don't know. <em>Don't look a gift horse in the mouth...</em></p>\n<p>We decide that a swim is actually a <em>brilliant</em> idea.</p>\n<p>So back down to the shore we go, and Shazza and I head in, with Ben the Australian and the other Canadian standing guard over our clothes.</p>\n<p><em>Good times.</em></p>\n<p>There's something about being naked in the ocean... Nothing quite like it...</p>\n<p>Back up onto the sand, I'm pulling the jeans through my crusty, sandy feet and up my wet legs.</p>\n<p>They feel <em>light...</em></p>\n<p>I pat myself down... <em>Flat.</em> Empty...</p>\n<p><em>Panic.</em></p>\n<p>All my shit’s gone.</p>\n<p>Wallet. New two-week-old phone that cost a fucking fortune.</p>\n<p>I look over the sand...</p>\n<p>Nothing. <em>Gone.</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;FUCK!!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>The thieving bastard left my jeans behind. How kind of him...</p>\n<p>But, you know what, <em>I don't even care.</em></p>\n<p>Nothing can ruin this night.</p>\n<p><em>I never thought anyone would kiss me again for the rest of my life...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>During an even wilder, far more debaucherous night the following evening, I make a solemn vow to the group that I will not buy another phone till I am 'in the foetal position and crying' for want of a rectangle... Seems healthy...</p>\n<p>It's a vow I plan to keep.</p>\n","<p>Winter is coming...</p>\n<p>I've done a half decent job of outrunning the winter so far, with only the occasional hypothermia-inducing downpour, but I've run out of mainland Europe to escape south to.</p>\n<p>There's nowhere else left to hide.</p>\n<p>Except <em>Africa.</em></p>\n<p>I was going to garage the bike and go skiing till the weather came good again...</p>\n<p>But then, Ben showed up.</p>\n<p>Ben and his fucking <em>epic</em> stories.</p>\n<p>He was planning on hitchhiking down to West Africa.</p>\n<p><em>Hitchhiking.</em> Again...</p>\n<p>&quot;Piss on that. Come on the back of the Enfield. We'll go together. You n me.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ok.&quot;</p>\n<p>And so, I adopted him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ben bought a helmet - that morning - and we were off.</p>\n<p>Two up, on a Royal Enfield.</p>\n<p>It was like something out of <em>The Motorcycle Diaries.</em> Except this guy wasn't my best mate...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In a very short space of time we've covered some serious mileage, put in some serious hours. Ben hasn't complained <em>once</em>, even after ten hour days on that back-seat. Must've been a nightmare, <em>the thing's the size of a hand...</em> Yet, not a peep. Half the time I forget he's even there, and I start singing to myself. He's so <em>quiet.</em></p>\n<p>The Enfield hasn't skipped a beat. It's handled the overload with aplomb.</p>\n<p>The three of us have gone down the Mediterranean coast of Spain, till now, we find ourselves, on the <em>rock of Gibraltar</em>.</p>\n<p>The end of Europe.</p>\n<p><em>The Strait.</em></p>\n<p>I can <em>see</em> Africa.</p>\n<p>I can't believe how <em>close</em> it is.</p>\n<p>That's bloody <em>Africa</em>, right there!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'm shitting bricks.</p>\n<p>I've asked Ben a thousand times. About everything. <em>Every possible thing.</em></p>\n<p>I'm <em>not</em> convinced that Africa can be done. At least not like this...</p>\n<p>I feel like I need a <em>'War Room'</em> of people back home, some sort of support. People who can sort shit out and send in the Marines when the proverbial shit hits the fan.</p>\n<p>Y'know, <em>organisation.</em></p>\n<p><em>Backup plans.</em></p>\n<p>Ben assures me it won't be a problem...</p>\n<p><em>I trust him.</em> But I'm sceptical as fuck.</p>\n<p>He's so <em>lackadaisical</em>, so thoroughly <em>nonplussed.</em></p>\n<p>He seems to be bordering on boredom...</p>\n<p>Is that assuring? Or concerning...?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We show up at a monstrous shipping port, pick a boat that looks like it's leaving soon, and ask to go to Morocco.</p>\n<p>Yep. No worries.</p>\n<p>We pay, and ride into the hull.</p>\n<p>The ship leaves.</p>\n<p>No questions asked.</p>\n<p><em>Easy...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Passport, prepare to get <em>devirginated.</em></p>\n<p><em>Morocco...</em></p>\n<p>Fucking <em>Africa.</em></p>\n<p>My first ever, <em>proper</em> border crossing.</p>\n<p>It's too many firsts at once...</p>\n<p>I'm not prepared for this.</p>\n<p>For a start, I don't have the papers. <em>Not even close.</em></p>\n<p>I'm missing a <em>'carnet'</em> (pronounced car-nay), which is a special set of travel documents for the bike, like a passport for vehicles... In just the same way that I can't cross a border without a passport, I can't take a vehicle across a border without a carnet.</p>\n<p>So... <em>That's</em> going to be fun...</p>\n<p>I also don't have an up-to-date <em>yellow fever certificate</em>, which is another dealbreaker (I've had the injection, I just don't have it <em>officially</em> written down anywhere...)</p>\n<p>So, between not having a carnet, not having an up to date yellow card, not having an international drivers license, not having legitimate bike insurance, not having anti-malarial tablets, not having any visas and not having any fucking idea, I'm feeling a bit out of my depth, and vulnerable...</p>\n<p>Tossed naked into the deep end.</p>\n<p>Shit. I don't even know <em>French</em>, let alone <em>Arabic...</em></p>\n<p>This is a bad idea...</p>\n<p>The mountains of Morocco loom large through the fog, getting closer and closer. I think Ben's ready to fall sleep...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ok, <em>here we go...</em></p>\n<p>The guards or border officials or whatever are nothing short of <em>resplendent</em>.</p>\n<p>Flamboyant sky-blue military style get-up. They look just like Paul McCartney in the <em>Sgt Peppers</em> cover, except with hats...</p>\n<p>Ben <em>loves</em> it. He reckons they’re the best dressed border guards on the planet. And he'd know.</p>\n<p>I park up the Enfield at the post, and it's a <em>circus.</em></p>\n<p>Three carloads of people, maybe five guards or officials or whatever, and everyone's <em>yelling.</em></p>\n<p>Moving and yelling.</p>\n<p>No English.</p>\n<p>Forms in French and Arabic are being moved about.</p>\n<p>I've got no fucking idea what I'm supposed to do...</p>\n<p>Ben starts quietly doing his thing, grabbing forms and filling them out for himself...</p>\n<p>I feel like that kid at school trying to cheat off everyone else, but I'm way behind the curve. Like, <em>way</em> behind.</p>\n<p>Ben's no help.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em> I thought he was going to help me through this...</p>\n<p>The bastard does his paperwork in ten minutes, gets stamped into the country, and goes and sits in the corner and waits for me.</p>\n<p>Mother. Fucker.</p>\n<p>Alright, guess I'm on my own then...</p>\n<p>I try to grok it, but there’s no rhyme or reason or procedure. It’s not obvious who I have to talk to, or what papers I need to show, or what paperwork I need to fill out, or how <em>any</em> of it fits together.</p>\n<p>No one wants to help me.</p>\n<p>But, then again, no one wants to fuck me either, which is a relief.... I was sure that the moment it became evident I was an utter novice at this that someone, or everyone, would try and pull my pants down...</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>It seems like I'm more of an irritation than anything; I get the distinct feeling that I'm giving everyone the shits with my English tongue.</p>\n<p>I bounce around the border post, try to keep smiling, and, eventually, <em>somehow,</em> I end up with a visa in my passport and a 'laissez-passer' for the bike. I dunno what that is, it's just a slip of paper with incomprehensible gibberish and a stamp... Might be something like a temporary carnet..?</p>\n<p>So. Is that it??</p>\n<p>No one's stopping me from leaving...</p>\n<p>I go collect Ben, and we ride out.</p>\n<p><em>I'm in.</em></p>\n<p>I’m in <em>Africa...</em></p>\n<p>Holy fuck... <em>What am I going to eat??</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>As the sun sets, Ben and I make it into Tangier, the closest city to the port.</p>\n<p>It's a madhouse.</p>\n<p>It's full of confusing tight alleyways that spaghetti all over the place.</p>\n<p><em>Thick</em> with people.</p>\n<p>The thumping bike makes a hell of a noise in the tight space and draws a <em>lot</em> of attention.</p>\n<p>The place reeks of cat piss, and already the locals are haranguing us.</p>\n<p>Hell of a welcome.</p>\n<p>I might have to get used to this...</p>\n<p>It doesn't <em>feel</em> like Africa. It feels like <em>Aladdin</em>, with cat piss.</p>\n<p>It's so confusing and tight that finding a hostel on two wheels is impossible.</p>\n<p>Ben goes on foot to sleuth it out.</p>\n<p>I’m on red alert - <em>someone is gonna to rob me.</em></p>\n<p>The locals won't leave me alone...</p>\n<p>I want to go back to Spain...</p>\n","<p><em>Dinner time.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that, even if I'm careful, anything I stick in my mouth isn't even going to touch the sides on the way through...</p>\n<p>One drop of Moroccan water in one end is going to turn things into a fire hydrant out the other...</p>\n<p><em>Whoosh...</em></p>\n<p>Ben and I are walking the streets, and we come across my <em>exact</em> nightmare: A crusty, homeless looking vendor is selling <em>meat sandwiches</em> from a push cart. Like the Moroccan version of a hot-dog seller.</p>\n<p><em>Revolting.</em></p>\n<p>Fucking horrorshow. There’s raw meat, sitting there, in the open. Then there’s tomato, lettuce and olives - amongst other mystery fillings - that are <em>glistening</em> with water.</p>\n<p>Ben asks how much for a sandwich, gets a response, then asks for how much with <em>double meat...</em></p>\n<p><em>Zing!</em></p>\n<p><em>I piss myself.</em> I never knew he had a sense of humour!</p>\n<p>Everyone, Ben included, stops to stare at me...</p>\n<p>The walnutted little Moroccan says something to Ben in French. Ben nods his head and puts up one finger.</p>\n<p>The little old Moroccan man goes to work, fanning his hot coals and throwing the mystery meats onto the grill...</p>\n<p>Finally, I find the words: “Ben! <em>What the fuck??</em>”</p>\n<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Are you <em>suicidal??</em> You can’t eat that!&quot;</p>\n<p>His expression is a mirror of mine...</p>\n<p>“What's the problem?”</p>\n<p>If this is a joke it's quickly getting elaborate...</p>\n<p>“You are <em>not</em> going to eat that.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“You’ll fucking <em>die!</em>”</p>\n<p>“Come one mate, really? Look,&quot; He gestures at the meat &quot;he’s cooking it right there in front of us. This is as good as it gets...”</p>\n<p><em>Shit a brick.</em></p>\n<p>I'm not going to last here... Not if this is 'as good as it gets'. How could it <em>possibly</em> get worse??</p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>Shit, shit, shit...</p>\n<p>I give the human walnut a peace sign. <em>Two, thanks...</em></p>\n<p>Explosive diarrhoea, here I come.</p>\n<p>The nut asks a question. I look at Ben.</p>\n<p>&quot;Double meat?&quot;</p>\n<p>Ugh. &quot;Wee. Yes...&quot; In for a penny in for a pound. Right?</p>\n<p>We watch as the chef finishes up with the double meat, and goes heavy on the fillings into a baguette. The sandwich is <em>enormous...</em></p>\n<p>It's hot. Actually smells alright...</p>\n<p>I want to eat it back at the hostel, preferably already sitting on the toilet...</p>\n<p>But Ben's having none of it, apparently that wouldn't be right. Bad manners, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Well, <em>when in Rome…</em></p>\n<p>I wait for Ben to take the first bite - a part of me <em>still</em> thinks he's taking the piss - but he doesn't hesitate, and tucks right in...</p>\n<p>So I take a bite too.</p>\n<p>It's <em>delicious</em>. A delicious fucking <em>time-bomb</em>.</p>\n<p>I scoff it all and then double-time it the fifteen minute walk back to the hostel.</p>\n<p>I make it without shitting my pants.</p>\n<p>A relief. But it's coming, I can <em>feel</em> it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We spend the night hanging out with a couple of other backpackers. I can't really focus on the conversation; every ounce of my mental energy is funnelled into feeling for the <em>slightest</em> movement from my bowels, and hearing every noise that's coming from outside in case someone's stealing or defiling my Enfield.</p>\n<p><em>I can't believe I have to leave it out on the street.</em></p>\n<p>Disaster's imminent. One way or the other. I can <em>feel</em> it.</p>\n<p>The second time I head to the window to make sure there's no one there, Ben gives me a disappointed look and a shake of the head.</p>\n<p><em>He looks a little angry.</em></p>\n<p>Five minutes later and I hear <em>another</em> noise. I have to get up to check, but Ben stops me dead.</p>\n<p>&quot;Get up one more time and I'll belt the shit out of you. <em>Stop</em> it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? I've gotta know!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, you don't. Let it go mate. You're not going to do this every-single-time. So stop. <em>Now.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>I acquiesce.</p>\n<p>I'm not gonna sleep well...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ok.</p>\n<p><em>Ben's the man.</em></p>\n<p>The Enfield is still there, my bowels are still intact.</p>\n<p>I've decided that Ben's going to be my guru.</p>\n<p>Mr Miyagi. Grasshopper.</p>\n<p>Yoda. Skywalker.</p>\n<p>It's gonna be the opposite of comfortable emulating this guy, but boundaries have to move...</p>\n<p><em>Give less of a shit. Be more reckless.</em></p>\n<p>Mum's gonna be stoked…</p>\n<p>We stroll through Tangier with a couple of girls from the hostel, Ben pipes up.</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you feel like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? A child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you feel... like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Wearing shorts. Does it make you feel like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ben. Explain yourself...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you see any <em>other</em> men wearing shorts?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Erm...&quot; I take a look around, &quot;No?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Noted...</em></p>\n","<p>After consuming a lot of meat sandwiches, frothy mint teas, delicious bread, addictive avocado and banana smoothies and more omelettes than I care to mention, we find ourselves at the bottom of Morocco.</p>\n<p>It's been about a month.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Nothing's gone wrong,</em> but I wouldn’t go rushing back to Morocco. It's a bit of a tourist trap, and I <em>hate</em> being harassed. Happy to be moving on.</p>\n<p>On the way through, we picked up a bald Belgian guy named Tony. He's heading south in a Volkswagen van that can best be described as a 'Swiss army knife'.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_10.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'm glad we found him. <em>He has beer and rum.</em></p>\n<p>But, better than that, Ben's been more than happy to ride shotgun in the van, and I'm happy to chuck all of my shit in the back, leaving me, naked, on the Enfield.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_11.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It's been <em>glorious.</em></p>\n<p>We've been surfing all down the coast.</p>\n<p>I've learned how to shit in a 'squat toilet'. It's basically just a hole in the floor... Once you get the hang of it - and stop accidentally pissing on your shoe - it’s quite an effective way to do business. Gone in 60 seconds... And I've finally got my eye in; these day's it's <em>nothing but net...</em></p>\n<p>Swish.</p>\n<p>Life skills.</p>\n<p>I've learned how to talk with my new teeth, and I've dropped the lisp. Those front two chompers are finally beginning to 'set', and not feel so <em>wobbly</em> all the time.</p>\n<p>All to the good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Speaking of good, Shazza decided to paratroop into Marrakesh for a fun week. She managed to re-align my broken nose with a stray headbutt during some bedroom gymnastics... The pleasure and the pain...</p>\n<p>On the way south, Tony the Belgian picked up two other strays; a mongrel puppy that he's named Synchro (after his van), and a Greek hitchhiker named Manos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_13.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We've all procured Mauritanian visas at the embassy in Morocco with ease; it's just a matter of showing up, saying you want a visa, filling out your details, paying, and wham, <em>visa;</em> we're now officially welcome in the country...</p>\n<p>From here, the die is cast: West. <em>The west coast.</em></p>\n<p>We can't change tack from here, because, <em>Sahara.</em></p>\n<p>We lost Ben.</p>\n<p>Which was a shame.</p>\n<p>A few days back we parted ways because he didn't want to camp out. So he just hitchhiked out of there, straight to the border without us. <em>I don't know how he does it...</em></p>\n<p>Thankfully though, this isn't Tony's first rodeo; he's been down this way before. So, with him and Manos the Greek, I feel pretty confident...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The border's in the middle of the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p>Tony the bald Belgian tells me that in between the two borders are four kilometres of <em>'no man's land'.</em></p>\n<p>&quot;What the fuck are you <em>talking</em> about Tony?? <em>No man's land?</em> This isn't <em>The Western Front..!</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>Tony elaborates. Apparently Morocco and Mauritania don’t like each other very much after the war they had fighting over the Western Sahara in the '70’s. Mauritania got belted, and they haven't seen eye to eye since.</p>\n<p>So, because of this, the no man's land is filled with mines.</p>\n<p>Not <em>dig-dig</em> mines but <em>bang-bang</em> mines.</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>landmines</em>.</p>\n<p>Tony's advice is &quot;don't stray off the road.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thanks Tony...</p>\n<p>If I wasn't shitting myself before, I am now.</p>\n<p><em>Landmines</em> aren't our only problem, Tony's van is packed full of smuggled rum and beer, and Mauritania is so uber-Muslim that alcohol is completely forbidden.</p>\n<p><em>Everywhere.</em> Completely dry.</p>\n<p>Add Synchro the puppy to the equation in and things could get interesting...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We pull in at nine o’clock in the morning in a drizzling rain.</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>rain...</em></p>\n<p>There’s a monster line of cars and trucks waiting to get in at the Moroccan border post. More than I can count...</p>\n<p>And I thought we’d got in early...</p>\n<p><em>Where the fuck has all this traffic come from??</em> We haven't seen hardly anyone in <em>days...</em></p>\n<p>On two wheels I go do that dickhead thing and ride straight on through the gridlock and park up at the front. I jump off the bike and wait for the other guys to catch up.</p>\n<p>Breakfast: omelette, baguettes and tea.</p>\n<p>By the time I'm done with that, the other guys have cut the line by half.</p>\n<p>I decide, being the novice of the crew, to go in and get a head start...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fucking <em>circus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Again.</em></p>\n<p>The Moroccan border post is a bunch of small buildings spread over half the size of a football pitch.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what I need to do to get out of the country, or who needs to know what...</p>\n<p><em>No idea...</em></p>\n<p>So, I just bounce around the buildings, walking where I'm told, following instructions, and basically do what everyone else is doing.</p>\n<p>Monkey-see, monkey-do.</p>\n<p>I take a guess at what the right answers are in the French forms until Tony and Manos arrive at the post to save the day.</p>\n<p>Eventually, all the required boxes are ticked, passports are 'exit stamped' and we’re out.</p>\n<p><em>No going back.</em></p>\n<p>We head into no man's land, and the tarmac <em>disappears.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is no road...</em></p>\n<p>It’s just open-ish yellow land with random tyre tracks snaking all over the place in the sand and rock.</p>\n<p>Different tracks... <em>Everywhere.</em></p>\n<p>Fuck... <em>Which track is 'the road'?</em></p>\n<p>I thought we were going to be on a proper fucking road! Like, fucking <em>bitumen!</em></p>\n<p>Tony's going first in the van, like the canary in the coal mine...</p>\n<p>I stick to his wheel-tracks like glue. If he doesn't blow up, I don't blow up.</p>\n<p><em>Right?</em></p>\n<p>Tony, in his turn, is right up the arse of the car in front of him.</p>\n<p>There are a surprising number of people just walking about out here. Loitering. Christ knows what they're up to. <em>Seems dodgy.</em> I don't know why, but I think of them like pirates...</p>\n<p>There's lots of burnt out car wrecks too, just in case I needed any reminders that this could end very fucking badly…</p>\n<p>Shitting. It.</p>\n<p>Where it's not soft sinking sand - which is a nightmare on the bike - it's razor sharp, pointy rocks instead. <em>Flat tyre city.</em></p>\n<p>I'm praying to just make it out the other end. If I get a puncture out here... Shit...</p>\n<p><em>Four crawling kilometres...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>No one died.</p>\n<p>Everyone's <em>black</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Everyone.</em></p>\n<p>Like, <em>uber-black.</em></p>\n<p>Black Africa. Couldn't be more in contrast with 'Arabian' Morocco.</p>\n<p>Again, I skip straight to the front of the line by virtue of my two wheels.</p>\n<p>The Mauritanian side of the post is making the Moroccan circus look positively <em>organised.</em></p>\n<p>It’s roughly the same size as the Moroccan post, but there are people <em>everywhere.</em></p>\n<p><em>Total chaos.</em></p>\n<p>Gone are the resplendent baby blue uniforms of the border guards. No 'official' type people to be seen anywhere...</p>\n<p>I park up right in front of the final boom gate out of the border post, where there's a military-ish looking bloke with an enormous gun.</p>\n<p>I hope he’ll keep an eye on my shit... Though he doesn’t look too happy to see me...</p>\n<p>I take off my helmet and give him a big smile and a knowing nod.</p>\n<p>I switch off the ignition.</p>\n<p>Like flies to shit I'm surrounded in seconds by <em>fixers</em> and money changers.</p>\n<p>Everyone's pulling and touching and pestering me.</p>\n<p><em>Immediate overload.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mobbed.</em></p>\n<p>My heart starts smashing so hard in my chest I can <em>feel</em> my pulse.</p>\n<p><em>I'm out of my depth...</em></p>\n<p>Externally though, I'm <em>calm like a bomb;</em> with a little smile on my face and a wave of my hand that says 'I’m a travelling veteran, don't waste your time boys, kindly fuck off'.</p>\n<p>I shake off the clowns as best I can and head off to the 'Gendarmerie'; which is a special police sort of thing, I think...</p>\n<p>I’m going to stick to doing things in the order that they were in when I came into the border: Gendarmes - Douanes - Police/Immigration.</p>\n<p>It’s as good a plan as any...</p>\n<p>The Gendarmerie is <em>crammed</em> with people. Squashed. People are spilling out onto the veranda. There's no semblance of a line or order. Just a mosh pit.</p>\n<p>I’m soaking up every detail I can, and I notice that everyone, and I mean <em>everyone</em>, has in their hand a little laminated piece of paper that looks like a special, crappy, drivers license.</p>\n<p><em>No one’s holding a passport...</em></p>\n<p>I don’t know what the laminated paper is - because it’s all written in French - but I know that I don’t have one.</p>\n<p>My heartrate spikes, again.</p>\n<p>I give my imagination it's reins, and it bolts in every possible direction, trying to figure out what the fuck's going on...</p>\n<p>I’ve only just started and I've already got a nightmare on my hands.</p>\n<p>I can feel a confrontation coming on. I <em>hate</em> confrontation. In any form. It makes me feel sick and queasy in the guts. Even the thought of it, or the potential of it, is enough to make my head fizz.</p>\n<p>I ask the punters what the laminated paper is. I'm asking in English, which is neither Arabic nor French, and of course I’m getting doughnuts back...</p>\n<p>They all want to see my passport, which ain’t gonna happen...</p>\n<p>With my sense of white entitlement I muscle my way into the dimly lit room.</p>\n<p>My eyes take a moment to adjust.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s clamouring to give their magic card to an un-uniformed man sitting at a desk in front of a couple of notepads. He’s taking down peoples details. Nothing about him say’s that he’s a 'Gendarme', but he must be; there’s no one else working here...</p>\n<p>I keep pushing forward to try to get to the front.</p>\n<p>Mr Plain Clothes lifts his head and spots me in the mosh.</p>\n<p>He gestures for me to come forward.</p>\n<p>I take my best guess and give him my passport.</p>\n<p><em>Pray.</em></p>\n<p>He asks me a question I don’t understand and gets my standard response that sounds like “Dessolay, je ne parl pa fransais”- Sorry, I don’t speak French...</p>\n<p>He asks another question (or was it the same question?) and gets the same response.</p>\n<p>While I hold my breath he goes to his notepad and starts writing, he then gives me back my passport plus a little, unintelligible slip of paper. He grabs the magic card of the next person...</p>\n<p><em>I think I’m done here...</em></p>\n<p>I mentally dance a jig as I walk out onto the veranda.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck yeah.</em></p>\n<p>That went way more smoothly than I thought it would...</p>\n<p>Those things that looked like licenses were probably just licenses.</p>\n<p>I need to calm the fuck down.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>By the time I’ve negotiated the Gendarmerie, Tony and Manos have arrived in the post and they go through the same process.</p>\n<p>Now we’re the three amigos again, and we head off together to get the 'laissez-passer', that temporary carnet thingo. For that, we need to talk to the 'Douanes', which is the Customs mob...</p>\n<p>Manos the Greek wants nothing to do with it (he doesn't have a vehicle…), so he just sits this one out.</p>\n<p>The Douanes building is just a shed, and like the Gendarmerie it's overflowing with people all clamouring to get the attention of the man with the books.</p>\n<p>We find the forms we need to fill in and head out onto the veranda to fill them out. As soon as it’s obvious that I don’t know French or Arabic - and therefore have no idea what I'm doing - the fixers all pile into me.</p>\n<p>One of them decides on the 'I’ll force my help on you now, and you’ll have to pay later' approach; he's telling me what to write down <em>while I'm already writing it down.</em> His tenacity is really starting to give me the shits...</p>\n<p>I feel like a cheating kid again, looking over Tony’s shoulder trying to shark the right answers. But he’s not exactly in the mood to help a brother out; he furiously writes down all his answers like they’re giving out prizes for speed, ignoring my pestering questions like &quot;Hey, what the fuck does 'immatriculation' mean?&quot; he finishes up, and goes and hands it in.</p>\n<p>Thanks a fuckin lot...</p>\n<p>Oddly, there's another whitey, a French guy, who is also trying to negotiate the border post, so I sidle up to him and try to sneak the rest of my test.</p>\n<p>I finish my answers as best I can, hand in my sheet, and we wait.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Nothing happens...</p>\n<p>Tony's getting the shits with how long it's all taking. The Frenchie is using a fixer, and Tony jumps onto the bandwagon.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure... <em>They all seem like crooks to me.</em></p>\n<p>But, if Tony gets through quickly with the fixer, and leaves me here stranded, alone, well... that's not a risk I'm happy taking.</p>\n<p>At least if the fixer fucks it up, we're all fucked together.</p>\n<p>Mob mentality. Strength in numbers.</p>\n<p>Money changes hands and time passes with seemingly no progress.</p>\n<p>No one seems to know what's going on.</p>\n<p>Disturbingly, I’ve given my passport and papers to someone I don’t know from a bar of soap and I’ll be buggered if I know where they are now. Off into the ether...</p>\n<p>All we get from our useless fixer are platitudes that it’ll all be sorted soon.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Hours...</em></p>\n<p>We’ve all reached the end our tether with the nagging money changers, the <em>still</em> pestering fixers, and our useless <em>bastard</em> fixer.</p>\n<p><em>We’re all ready to snap.</em></p>\n<p>Right when Tony is shaping up to go fucking postal, we get our papers back: passports, regos and the all-important laissez-passer.</p>\n<p>We can finally move on.</p>\n<p>Walking to Immigration, we inspect the new LP’s.</p>\n<p>We’ve only been given <em>seven days</em>.</p>\n<p>One week!?</p>\n<p>It's <em>impossible;</em> Mauritania’s fucking huge, and on slow Royal Enfield it’s even bigger.</p>\n<p>It’s just not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Our fixer comes in for some verbal treatment from just about everyone.</p>\n<p><em>Fucking lynch him...</em></p>\n<p>He says he'll fix it, and heads off into the crowd.</p>\n<p>We never see him again, of course...</p>\n<p>Group meeting time; the consensus is that the fixer skimped on the amount spent on the LP, getting a shorter duration to save money, and then pocketed the difference.</p>\n<p>Clever fucker.</p>\n<p>We take our indignation back to the Douanes and <em>demand</em> and extension.</p>\n<p><em>“Um-pos-ee-bleh”.</em></p>\n<p>Even I know that one...</p>\n<p>We’re told our only two options are to return to the border after seven days and go through the whole clusterfuck again, <em>or</em> we can go to the Douanes in the capital, and hope they'll give us an extension.</p>\n<p>Bugger option one in the arse. I’d rather eat dog shit than come back to this border post...</p>\n<p>Option two isn’t that much better; we'll be putting ourselves in their power. With zero leverage it'll be easy to get put over the barrel...</p>\n<p>Tony’s on the same wavelength that both those options suck, and he’s not having any of it either. He <em>demands</em> to talk to the head of the Douanes.</p>\n<p>&quot;Onya Tony!!&quot;</p>\n<p>We ride on Tony’s coattails into a different building, and then spend an inordinate amount of time getting passed around and waiting.</p>\n<p>I’ve still got no idea what the fuck's going on. I just sit and nod my head...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tony finally talks us up to <em>the boss</em>.</p>\n<p><em>He's a she.</em></p>\n<p>Which for a country like Mauritania is a bit of a headfuck. <em>She doesn't even have her head covered.</em></p>\n<p>After an explanation from Tony, and no money changing hands, she takes the LP’s back to Mr Um-pos-ee-bleh, has a word. He writes something on the LP, stamps it, and that’s it.</p>\n<p><em>Easy as that.</em></p>\n<p>So much for impossible... Arsehole.</p>\n<p>Our hero vanishes before we notice that they've extended the LP from seven days to ten days.</p>\n<p><em>This is beyond a joke.</em></p>\n<p>We start the cycle of indignation again and then realise that it’s futile.</p>\n<p>We’ve all had enough of it and just want it to be over now; cut the losses and move on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On the way to Police/Immigration I check in on the Enfield.</p>\n<p>Being the gorgeous machine it is, it always draws a crowd of admirers, which, rather than being pleasant, is more scary than anything...</p>\n<p><em>It's got everything I own on it.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’m</em> not even that slick, and I could steal everything off that bike in under ten seconds. <em>Easy.</em> Simply undo the straps that hold it to the seat and it all lifts away.</p>\n<p>Piece of cake.</p>\n<p>Yet, it hasn't been touched.</p>\n<p>It always surprises me...</p>\n<p>We head into Immigration.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What a shambles.</p>\n<p>I'm <em>knackered</em>. My brain's not working like it should...</p>\n<p>Everyone’s moving about but nothing seems to be getting done. Whoever has the least manners is the person who gets served next. The officials are behind closed doors, and only pop their heads out into the hallway to grab a new passport.</p>\n<p>Tony and Manos are particularly irritable. We’ve been at the border for about six hours now and we’ve spent most of that time standing around waiting. Neither of them have eaten anything since an early breakfast at camp maybe eight hours ago, and both of them look as though they’re about to crack shits.</p>\n<p>There's no one here to take it out on either, so we end up venting our spleens at each other...</p>\n<p><em>We can't skip this...</em> It's a simple thing we need; just an ink stamp with the date and the 'port of entry/exit' on it, but it's <em>vital</em>. If we don't get entry/exit stamps in our passports, then we've illegally entered/exited that country. Deep shit... Ben's been <em>deported</em> for that before...</p>\n<p>Every now and again there’s a glimmer of hope and a mad scramble at the door as it opens a crack, only to be closed again.</p>\n<p>Ratchet the frustration.</p>\n<p>The next time the door opens the three of us practically <em>throw</em> our passports through the gap.</p>\n<p>Then wait.</p>\n<p>Whenever the door opens we see our passports slowly getting buried to the bottom of an ever-growing pile. It’s starting to make sense why there’s a small, shitty hotel inside this border post...</p>\n<p>Tony’s had a gutful, is furious, and barges into the room on the next opening.</p>\n<p>Riding his coattails again, we all pile in.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to rant, but we keep a lid on it: honey catches more flies than vinegar...</p>\n<p>Some questions later and we have our stamped passports.</p>\n<p><em>It’s over.</em></p>\n<p>We form up and roll out.</p>\n<p>Into Mauritania...</p>\n<p><em>How the hell did this happen??</em></p>\n","<p><em>Mauritania.</em></p>\n<p>It's a country, and it's <em>not</em> Mauritius.</p>\n<p>Couldn't be further from it...</p>\n<p>According to the map, there are only two 'cities' in Mauritania.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't even call Nouadhibou that...</p>\n<p><em>What a shitheap.</em></p>\n<p>A dirty, smoky, filthy chaos.</p>\n<p>The other 'city' is a half day's ride away. Not an option...</p>\n<p>The troupe of three have gone from being mildly conspicuous in Morocco to standing out like dogs balls here; all eyes are on us. It's unnerving, and weird.</p>\n<p>The first accommodation option we pick out is an absolute <em>shocker.</em> I’m all for keeping it rough and cheap, but this place is <em>beyond.</em></p>\n<p><em>Way</em> beyond.</p>\n<p>Filthy mattresses on the floor, and I can <em>see</em> the bed bugs.</p>\n<p>Actually fucking <em>see</em> them crawling...</p>\n<p>The search continues.</p>\n<p>The second place we roll into looks more promising...</p>\n<p>Out of one of the rooms comes <em>Ben</em>, grinning like an idiot. Small world...</p>\n<p>Ben vouches for the place (he hasn’t seen any bed bugs yet…) so we shack up.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Lunch.</em></p>\n<p>The first place we come across is peddling pasta with grisly mystery meat. I'm hungry. Manos and Tony are starving. It'll do.</p>\n<p>We tuck in and compare notes from the border...</p>\n<p>Tony’s making the call that it’s the worst border crossing he’s ever done.</p>\n<p><em>Ever...</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank fuck for that.</em> If that border was par-for-the-course... I just couldn't...</p>\n<p>After Ben parted ways with us two days ago he immediately hitchhiked to the border, managed to clear the Moroccan post, and then <em>walked</em> no man's land <em>that night</em>.</p>\n<p>He got caught stranded on the Mauritanian side - they'd closed up for the night, so he stayed at that 'hotel'.</p>\n<p>The next day he was first in line to clear the border and hitchhiked to Nouadhibou. <em>Easy peasy...</em></p>\n<p>We shove the pasta into our faces, and have a laugh that we’re now in 'black Africa' and cheers our teacups to that.</p>\n<p>The awesome foursome ride again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>No one gets violently ill after lunch, and there's quickly an appetite for dinner.</p>\n<p>“Senegalese sandwiches” are on the menu, off the street. Pretty simple stuff: a French baguette, fill it with anything deep-fried, then drown that in sauce.</p>\n<p><em>Delicious heart attack.</em></p>\n<p>While I'm eating my second sandwich I have a bitch about my financial situation. I can't pull money from <em>any</em> of the cash machines here. Rejected, every time.</p>\n<p>Tony wants to know what card I'm using...</p>\n<p>&quot;A MasterCard, why?&quot;</p>\n<p>Tony laughs. &quot;Got a Visa card?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No. Why?&quot;</p>\n<p>More laughter. “Good luck”.</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Why is that funny?</em> What are you talking about??&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;MasterCard won't work in West Africa, just Visa. How could you not know that?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? How <em>could</em> I know that?? I don't believe you... It's <em>MasterCard!</em> It worked in Morocco!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah well, good luck.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What..? <em>Ugh...</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>It'll work.</p>\n<p>It <em>has</em> to work. <em>It can't not work,</em> otherwise I can't get money...</p>\n<p>Ben interrupts my thoughts.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm heading to Chinguetti tomorrow on an iron ore train. Who wants to come?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;What??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;I'm heading to Chinguetti tomorrow on an iron ore train... Want to come?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>How</em> are you doing that?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Hitchhiking.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;That doesn't help mate...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Hitchhiking in the carriages is allowed. And it's free.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? You're making that up... How long's the ride?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Twelve hours...&quot;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is fucking <em>crazy.</em></p>\n<p>We're fucking mad.</p>\n<p>Christ, if this wasn't an adventure before, it sure as fuck is now...</p>\n<p>The Enfield had to stay behind. Can't get it on the train. I don't know how I'm going to get it back. I've left it at a random motel after our motelier wouldn't keep it for me.</p>\n<p>No guarantees it will stay there...</p>\n<p>I don't feel good about it, but I didn't want to miss out on this...</p>\n<p>We sit on the side of the empty rails and wait.</p>\n<p>No motorbike, not a lot of cash, and just a change of clothes in a 'daypack'. That's it...</p>\n<p>Me, Manos and Ben.</p>\n<p>Tony the Belgian is too smart for this, and has continued on south...</p>\n<p>There's a sign next to the tracks, a big one, evidently put up by the mining company. It says a bunch of stuff in French and Arabic...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_14.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I think that 'danger de mort' might mean 'danger of death'.</p>\n<p>It's written twice...</p>\n<p>I ask Manos - who has passable French - what it says.</p>\n<p>“It doesn't say that we can't do it...”</p>\n<p>Well, that’ll do, I guess.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>What an arrival...</em></p>\n<p>It’s <em>immense.</em></p>\n<p>The bloody thing just goes and goes and goes.</p>\n<p>Iron ore containers shrink off to a vanishing point in <em>both</em> directions.</p>\n<p>They're not what you think of when you think of train carriages; they're not <em>boxcars</em>. It's just a container to hold dirt. That's it...</p>\n<p>Finally, the never-ending procession comes screaming to a halt.</p>\n<p><em>Pick a container. Any container.</em></p>\n<p>A handful of locals start furiously loading the carriages with food and drinks and basically anything that they can sell at the mines. Enterprising mob...</p>\n<p>We pick a random car - they're all as good as each other - when police show up...</p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>They're honking their horn at us, gesturing wildly at us to come to them. <em>Immediately.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>The three of us sheepishly head over to the cop car - <em>sprung.</em></p>\n<p>They're not making any sense to us, not even to Manos, but they're gesturing over to another carriage, as if to say <em>&quot;look!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>What's going on??</p>\n<p>We follow their gaze to a carriage further down the line. It's being loaded with <em>mattresses.</em></p>\n<p>Oh. You bloody ripper!</p>\n<p>This is a <em>massive</em> bonus.</p>\n<p>Huge.</p>\n<p><em>Colossal.</em></p>\n<p>From rough as guts to a bed of roses.</p>\n<p><em>This is a fucking coup.</em></p>\n<p>We sprint to the carriage and jump aboard.</p>\n<p>The mattresses are stacked level with the top of the container walls, so we’ll be able to sit on top of them and watch the Sahara roll by. There are three stacks. One each.</p>\n<p><em>It’s fucking perfect.</em></p>\n<p>The capitalists are still furiously loading the crap into the containers, and they’ve got a <em>pile</em> of shit to go, so Manos jumps out of the carriage to take some photos while Ben and I keep exploring the new home.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>What’s that... noise?</em></p>\n<p>It's a long way off, but it's getting louder...</p>\n<p>&quot;Hey, Ben, do you hear that?&quot;</p>\n<p>We both go quiet, it's getting <em>closer</em>, and <em>louder</em>. Like someone's letting off <em>bombs...</em></p>\n<p>We both look up the line of carriages, where the banging is coming from...</p>\n<p>It's coming this way - <em>fast.</em></p>\n<p>Louder and closer.</p>\n<p>Till it's a <em>roar</em>.</p>\n<p><em>It's coming right for us.</em></p>\n<p>&quot;FUUUUUCK.. <em>BEN..!!</em>&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Engage sphincter.</em></p>\n<p>Bang bang <em>BANG</em> BOOOOM!!!!</p>\n<p>I shit my pants as the world moves under my feet and the carriage lurches into motion.</p>\n<p>&quot;What the actual <em>FUCK</em> Ben!?&quot;</p>\n<p>The banging and crashing echoes down the train, Doppler style.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Manos!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Ben and I pounce on the side of the carriage.</p>\n<p>Manos is <em>flying.</em></p>\n<p>You’ve never seen anyone move so fast...</p>\n<p>Ben and I scream jump and wave. <em>Adrenaline.</em></p>\n<p><em>We have all of his shit...</em></p>\n<p>Manos jumps onto the side of the moving carriage like a fucking stunt double.</p>\n<p>We’re away.</p>\n<p><em>No going back now.</em></p>\n","<p><em>Dust.</em></p>\n<p>All of the leftover iron ore from every carriage in front of us is going airborne.</p>\n<p>We’re moving fast enough that the wind whistles in the ears.</p>\n<p>It’s like being <em>sandblasted.</em></p>\n<p>The air is <em>thick</em> with it, and there's nowhere to escape.</p>\n<p>We each have a unique way of solving the problem. Manos pulls out a thick, black, woollen surgeons mask. I'll be fucked if I know where he got that from... I'm fuckin jealous.</p>\n<p>To cover his eyes he borrows my aviator sunnies. He looks like he could be a new <em>Mortal Kombat</em> character, half <em>Scorpion</em>, half <em>Johnny Cage.</em></p>\n<p><em>Flawless victory.</em></p>\n<p>Ben expertly uses a spare t-shirt like a Tuareg’s head-wrap. He looks like the <em>Dakar Rally</em> logo... He looks like a terrorist... He looks like he's done this before...</p>\n<p>He's done such a good job that he's only got a slit left for his eyes, which he covers with his sunnies.</p>\n<p>Desert Storm.</p>\n<p>Uber badass.</p>\n<p>I take my bandana that I usually wear inside my helmet and wrap it across my mouth and nose like a train robber from an old Western movie.</p>\n<p>Not so badass... But the train robber bit is topical at least. <em>I look the part.</em></p>\n<p>We’re <em>pinging</em> on the awesomeness of just being here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_15.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We start doing dumb shit with lots of energy...</p>\n<p>Ben starts 'surfing' on the mattresses. Standing up. The carriages are swinging and bouncing all over the shop, but he’s making it look pretty easy. Monkey-see monkey-do, as Manos gets up there to give it a crack.</p>\n<p>He almost immediately comes a gutser, very fucking close to going over the edge. His sphincter won't unlock for a few hours, I reckon...</p>\n<p>Me?</p>\n<p><em>Fuck that.</em></p>\n<p>Mum would never forgive me if I died trainsurfing the Sahara Desert...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Our giddy enthusiasm lasts for a few hours.</p>\n<p>We calm down, and settle in for the long haul.</p>\n<p>It's just us and the dunes of the Sahara.</p>\n<p>The sun’s slowly making its way to the undulating horizon. Through the thick dust cloud I can stare right at it without hurting my eyes. Kind of like wearing a welders mask.</p>\n<p>I've never noticed it before, because I've never been able to look right at it like this - without the glare and brightness - but the sun is just a clear, round orb.</p>\n<p>It's bloody <em>huge.</em></p>\n<p>The odd thought occurs to me that we’re orbiting around this monstrous ball of fusing hydrogen - right now - just obliviously hurtling around it.</p>\n<p>And I get that 'infinitesimally small' feeling that I get when I look up at the stars in the night sky for long enough. <em>Existential crisis territory.</em></p>\n<p>But this is in the broad daylight, in the middle of the Sahara, on an iron ore train... It makes me feel insignificant and puny in the most <em>fantastic</em> way. Like it doesn't matter what I do, <em>ever,</em> the universe just doesn’t give a shit. Will <em>never</em> give a shit.</p>\n<p>Couldn’t care less.</p>\n<p>It’s a strange notion that I find empowering. It’s a wonderful justification to do just about anything... Just like this. <em>Case in point.</em></p>\n<p>If the universe doesn’t give a flying fuck, then why should I?</p>\n<p>The sun sets...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Things get dark, and chilly. <em>Fast.</em></p>\n<p>Dinner time.</p>\n<p>We chow down the food that we brought along: A couple of baguettes and some liquid cheese that I swear will outlast the apocalypse. Christ knows what’s in that garbage...</p>\n<p>Half of what we eat is food. The other half is dust...</p>\n<p>A local bloke comes along, he's been jumping between the carriages. Fucking <em>maniac.</em></p>\n<p>He gives us some oranges. Bonus. We love this guy.</p>\n<p>We lay out on the mattresses and stare up at the canvas of stars through the dust, for the long, long ride.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Time stretches out.</p>\n<p>The dust seems to get even worse, if that’s possible. Flash photography won’t work anymore; it’s just a whiteout of lit-up dust.</p>\n<p>Imagine someone throwing a fistful of talcum powder into your face - point blank - every ten seconds, with your eyes and mouth open...</p>\n<p>Tear ducts are in overdrive to try and keep the eyes clear.</p>\n<p>Balls of mud made up of tears and dust had formed up on the sides of my eyes. The gunk is about the size of a ball bearing. <em>That can’t be good for ya...</em></p>\n<p>The three of us try to get some sleep, but that's going to be complicated. For one, we have to get off the train at a place called Choum, which isn't the last stop, so we don't want to sleep through it... Second, every time the train accelerates or decelerates, stops or starts, it makes that crescendo of terrifying banging as the carriages either smash together or smash apart, just like it did at the very start.</p>\n<p>It happens <em>all the time.</em></p>\n<p>Even though I can hear it coming a mile away (literally) it still makes me shit my pants as it comes smashing through our carriage. <em>It's that loud.</em></p>\n<p>We make a game of screaming <em>“INCOMING!!”</em> every time we hear it start up at the front, like we're in a fucking war movie.</p>\n<p>While we're trying to sleep, our mate with the oranges brings us blankets, he even tucks us in.</p>\n<p>Seriously, love that guy...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm getting delirious.</p>\n<p>It must be somewhere <em>near</em> dawn...</p>\n<p>A long time ago things changed from being an adventure into being a grind... The senses have been almost constantly assaulted, barely without respite.</p>\n<p>The train has been stopped in the middle of the desert for an inordinate amount of time. <em>What could they possibly be doing??</em>.</p>\n<p>I sit up and look around. Fuck all...</p>\n<p>A random guy walks past. I pop the question.</p>\n<p>&quot;Choum?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Bar bar</em> Choum&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Choum?!?&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Wee&quot;</p>\n<p>I raise the alarm. We scramble.</p>\n<p>Chucking our shit over the edge onto the sand and jumping out before the train takes us to the fucking mines...</p>\n<p><em>It's over.</em></p>\n<p>The train leaves, and there's an eerie silence in the dark...</p>\n<p>Was there a plan for this?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I come to...</p>\n<p>I'm being <em>squashed</em>. In a car. Full of <em>black people.</em></p>\n<p><em>Panic.</em></p>\n<p>I start making panicked noise... then it all comes back to me in a rush.</p>\n<p><em>I remember getting in this car...</em></p>\n<p>I'm in the Sahara Desert. It's ok...</p>\n<p>I calm my smashing heart and try to remember what's going on in my half-sleep. There's, how many... <em>nine blokes</em> in the cab of the ute. I remember one bloke sitting on top of the huge pile of dried fish on the back, so that makes ten. I wouldn't be surprised if I was dreaming of being a sardine, the image is perfect, but the man who's sitting on me has got his armpit right up my nose, so that's covering the smell. I don't know what's worse; this bloke smells like he's never had a shower in his life... He probably hasn't...</p>\n<p><em>We've been lucky.</em></p>\n<p>If they weren't in Choum, well, we'd be in the shit...</p>\n<p>Head on window. Desert sands. <em>Fade to black.</em></p>\n","<p><em>Atar.</em></p>\n<p>Sun's rising.</p>\n<p>That makes it - since yesterday lunchtime - about eighteen hours from door to door.</p>\n<p>Solid.</p>\n<p>And people complain about taking an eighteen hour flight...</p>\n<p>We check into a cheap hotel and take turns showering off the dust.</p>\n<p>I sleep like a dead man.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Atar, it turns out, is a bit of a rubbish tip; like Nouadhibou, but in a weird way it's almost interestingly <em>grimey</em>; the colour and vibrancy of the vegetables at the market, side by side with big racks of meat covered in flies. And all the <em>noise...</em> It makes for compelling viewing.</p>\n<p>It still <em>feels</em> like the Middle East. It's not at all what I expected from Africa.</p>\n<p>I pay for breakfast/lunch with the last of my money. I'm not <em>smart</em> when it comes to this shit, and I haven't planned for what might happen if I can't get money; there's no wad of US dollars in a secret pocket somewhere. As soon as my credit card stopped working the cash dried up. <em>Fast.</em></p>\n<p>Ben's broke too.</p>\n<p>I don't think Manos ever had any money...</p>\n<p>Ben and I spend the afternoon seeking out cash machines. We're lucky that they even have them here, in this tiny town in the middle of nowhere. Not that they're any fucking use to me; I'm rejected, every time.</p>\n<p>Ben's rejected, every time, <em>despite having a Visa card.</em></p>\n<p>Aaaand - we're - fucked.</p>\n<p>Frustrating. <em>Scary.</em></p>\n<p>Frustrating, because I know there's fucking money there, a bloody bucket of the stuff, but I can't get at it. Scary, because what fucking happens now? I could get money wired to me from my family... But then, where to collect?</p>\n<p>How do I manage food, accommodation and transport with no money?</p>\n<p>The only thing I can do is rely on the kindness of strangers...</p>\n<p><em>Dirt poor strangers.</em></p>\n<p>It's <em>heinously</em> unfair.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back to the hotel (just how, <em>exactly,</em> am I going to pay for that..?) and on the way, there's another cash machine that we missed.</p>\n<p>It's <em>ancient.</em> Unlikely.</p>\n<p>I try.</p>\n<p>Fucking rejected.</p>\n<p>Ben tries.</p>\n<p>It looks like his card's been swallowed...</p>\n<p>Now we've got to fucking sort <em>that</em> out.</p>\n<p><em>God fucking damn it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Crunch-crunch-crunch-crunch-crunch...</em></p>\n<p><em>Wait...!</em></p>\n<p>The cash machine opens its mouth spits out a <em>fat</em> wad of notes.</p>\n<p>Saved!! Fucking <em>saved!</em></p>\n<p>Beautiful 'ouguiya'. Best currency in the world.</p>\n<p><em>Thank fuck for that...</em></p>\n<p>Ben even gets his card back.</p>\n<p>Shit yeah. And <em>breathe.</em></p>\n<p>Well, I'll be fucked if I'm doing that again...</p>\n<p>Ben lends me 10,000 ouguiya - he seems the opposite of impressed about it.</p>\n<p>It's about forty bucks worth. It should be able to get me through four days worth out here in the desert, if I'm guessing right. Mauritania is cheap as chips...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I head to the 'cyber' and get my shit in a pile.</p>\n<p>It's like pulling teeth with the shithouse connection, but I manage to apply for a new credit card back in Australia. Would've taken five minutes to do back home. Here: five hours. Shit, I might have accidentally applied for <em>ten</em> cards with all those timeouts. Who knows if they worked or not...</p>\n<p>In many ways it's scary just how <em>easy</em> it was. Here I am, in Mauritanian Sahara, half a world away, and I can apply for a credit card. Crazy, really. And a little dodgy.</p>\n<p>I get it sent to my parents address. When they get it they'll have to forward it on to wherever I am.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I send my dad a secret email and a secret $500 for him to wire to me here in Mauritania. Apparently, I can't wire it to myself; that's called 'money laundering'.</p>\n<p>While I'm at it, I send Dad a 'break in case of emergency' pile of money so he can just forward it to me if I end up in the shit again.</p>\n<p>It's going to be ok...</p>\n","<p><em>Chinguetti.</em></p>\n<p>Dunes as far as the eye can see.</p>\n<p>The Sahara is <em>exactly</em> how you’d imagine it, just bigger, and not as hot.</p>\n<p>Ben fell in love with the place immediately. His enthusiasm brought us all along for the ride; I love it a bit too.</p>\n<p>It's an ancient, semi-ruined half-village-half-city.</p>\n<p>The whole place is built out of rocks that look like they've been stacked exactly how they came out of the ground. The whole village is just shades of the colour 'sand'.</p>\n<p>It's beautiful.</p>\n<p>And empty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_16.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As we walk through the ancient city, we pick up kids on the way like the <em>Pied Piper</em>. They get so excited to see us that they start chanting some tribal war shit, and belting the snot out of each other with big steel <em>re-bars,</em> as if for our entertainment...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_17.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We shake them off and, together, we roam the Sahara, because we can.</p>\n<p>Camels and sand...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_18.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Mosquitos.</em></p>\n<p>My god, the mosquitos...</p>\n<p><em>Swarms.</em></p>\n<p>A fucking <em>armada.</em></p>\n<p>I've never seen anything like it...</p>\n<p>I have my sleeping bag zipped all the way to the top, and the strap pulled so tight that all you can see are my lips.</p>\n<p><em>I'm still being eaten alive.</em></p>\n<p>So - incredibly - <em>itchy.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>noise.</em></p>\n<p>It's like the Flight of the Valkyries.</p>\n<p>There are so many of them that it becomes a <em>hum</em>, but I can still pick out the sound of the one closest to my ear...</p>\n<p><em>That iconic noise...</em></p>\n<p>Sleep?</p>\n<p><em>Impossible.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bleary eyed as the sun rises and the mozzies retreat, we jump another 'bush taxi'.</p>\n<p>I look like I've got a bad case of <em>chicken pox.</em> The fuckers have eaten my face.</p>\n<p>Each one could be carrying malaria...</p>\n<p>A few hours of nothing but Sahara on a lonely dirt road, and then...</p>\n<p><em>Ouadane.</em> Pronounced &quot;wa-darn&quot;.</p>\n<p><em>Magnificent.</em></p>\n<p>It looks like something out of the poem <em>Ozymandias.</em></p>\n<p>'...round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away...'</p>\n<p>It looks like giant wasp nest from a distance. A <em>colossal wreck</em> up close.</p>\n<p>When I first spotted it I thought it was something <em>natural</em>, like a mountain.</p>\n<p><em>What a city this must have been...</em></p>\n<p>Shit. There must a billion rocks in there.</p>\n<p>In the same design as Chinguetti, but <em>massive.</em></p>\n<p>And empty...</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the city is just rocks. There are only a few small pockets in the middle where a handful of people still live.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While we're exploring and looking for food (and not having much luck at that...) a young kid, a teenager, comes sprinting up to us.</p>\n<p>&quot;Hello!!&quot;</p>\n<p>I've no trust for anyone who wants to talk to me, ever...</p>\n<p>He's wearing the traditional get-up of the 'Berbers'. It's pretty awesome, really, like a double shouldered robe, like a Muslim <em>Sub-Zero.</em> Impractical, no doubt. Pretty pimp though..</p>\n<p>&quot;Hi.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Hello!!!</em> Can I speak English with you?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Sure...&quot;</p>\n<p>So we talk...</p>\n<p>The kid, turns out, is something of a genius. A prodigy.</p>\n<p>His name is Mohammed, like everyone else here.</p>\n<p>He's never left Ouadane. <em>Not in his entire life.</em></p>\n<p>He's never even been the couple of hours down the road to Chinguetti, <em>never seen it.</em></p>\n<p>He has spent his entire life, isolated, in this ruinous village.</p>\n<p>He speaks <em>perfect</em> English.</p>\n<p>Bang on.</p>\n<p>He's been learning what he can from the very occasional traveller, just like he's doing with us.</p>\n<p>We might as well have been Santa Claus to this kid. <em>He is so eager to learn.</em></p>\n<p>You've never seen a bigger, more genuine smile.</p>\n<p>It never leaves his face.</p>\n<p>Happier than a pig in shit.</p>\n<p>He's <em>delighted</em> when we accept his offer to have lunch at his house with his family.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We step through a metal door and into the courtyard. The first thing that grabs my attention is something <em>alive</em> hanging from the clothes line.</p>\n<p><em>What is that??</em></p>\n<p>I walk closer. Is that a, <em>beehive??</em></p>\n<p>No. It's a writhing ball of flies.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>Are they all, fucking??</p>\n<p>They're going nuts... <em>What are they doing??</em></p>\n<p>I swish them away - with difficulty - to reveal a piece of meat the size of a fist underneath. Like a tennis ball in a stocking.</p>\n<p>Ree-pulsive.</p>\n<p>Must be 'out to dry'...</p>\n<p>I push back the bile and head inside with everyone else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We eat.</p>\n<p>No points for guessing what...</p>\n<p>I don't even care, I'm too busy making eyes at Mo's sister...</p>\n<p>Hands down the most beautiful woman I've seen in a long, long time.</p>\n<p><em>Sweet baby Cheeses...</em> I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like her...</p>\n<p>Once we're finished with lunch (which was, actually, <em>really</em> good) she starts to do her prayers.</p>\n<p>And it's too much for me. She might as well be doing yoga in activewear...</p>\n<p>I reckon Manos and Ben are having the same dilemma...</p>\n<p>Anyway. Mo hasn't stopped talking.</p>\n<p>He's actually a really good kid... A <em>really</em> good kid...</p>\n<p>I feel for him.</p>\n<p>Imagine that much intelligence, stuck in a place so isolated.</p>\n<p>I want to adopt him, take him with us on the journey, and show him everything that he's never seen before.</p>\n<p>&quot;Luke, can I ask you something?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mate, I keep telling you, you don't have to ask permission. Go for it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ok. Thank you. Are there really diamonds in the sky?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Diamonds in the sky? No... What do you mean mate?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Rihanna, she says that they are <em>diamonds in the sky.</em> Is that true? Are they <em>really</em> diamonds?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>What!?</em> Wait... How do you know about <em>Rihanna?</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>He's chuffed. &quot;I have the music, other travellers gave it to me. Oh! Do you like Justin Bieber??&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Unbelievable.</em></p>\n<p>This poor kid needs a role model.</p>\n<p>He's crestfallen as I chastise him for his taste in music, and drum home the point that he can never, ever, <em>under any circumstances,</em> believe anything he hears in a song from any pop artist, ever.</p>\n<p>&quot;What's 'pop'?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Never mind mate. If you like I can give you some new music, how does that sound&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes!

I feel like I'm abandoning Mo...</p>\n<p>We hitch a ride in the tray of a ute back to Atar. It rains, and it's cold enough to wear my only jumper. I still can't believe it, rain in the Sahara...</p>\n<p>In Atar we hitch another ride the long, long drive to the capital on the coast, Nouakchott.</p>\n<p>Seven hours of driving. I'm still not done...</p>\n<p>I've gotta get back to Nouadhibou, where the Enfield is...</p>\n<p>That's another six hours, with many time-outs for prayer to add in.</p>\n<p>At least the road is good...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_20.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Success!</p>\n<p>The Enfield, somewhat miraculously, is <em>exactly</em> where I left it.</p>\n<p>Now. Back to Nouakchott.</p>\n<p>Cue eight hours.</p>\n<p>Eight hours at eighty clicks per hour.</p>\n<p>Eight brain-deadening hours of re-tracing my footsteps through absolutely fuck-all for the second time in two days.</p>\n<p>That's the kind of distance that I'd normally chop in two, but the only thing, <em>the only thing</em>, between the two cities is five hundred clicks of road and a petrol station.</p>\n<p><em>Vie de merde,</em> as the French say: Life of shit.</p>\n<p>Delirious, at the end of my tether, I re-join Ben and Manos in Nouakchott, and collapse.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's not a particularly likeable place, Nouakchott, but I like it anyway. Grimey and interesting, yet liveable. I think it's also that, to me, it feels exotic, or, at least, the path less travelled. After Morocco it's been nothing short of refreshing; no one gives me the shits here. I haven't been harassed <em>once.</em></p>\n<p>I've been busy.</p>\n<p>Even though I could have easily gone back to the border post again and renewed my LP for another ten days, that wasn't an experience I wanted to repeat, so I headed to the Douanes in Nouakchott instead.</p>\n<p>Took me a morning to find them... Fucking impossible to find a place with zero fucking French skills.</p>\n<p>Once there, I got the feeling that they didn't really want to help me out, so I just stayed in their faces and outlasted them for patience; I'm getting better at this waiting game... <em>Success.</em></p>\n<p>The three of us have managed to pick up visas for Senegal at their embassy. Not easy, but certainly not what you'd call complex. Just lots of hoops to jump through, but each jump is relatively painless; stuff like having to have two passport sized photos handy, and having a letter of invitation ready (which is easily forged). Stuff like that. <em>Success.</em></p>\n<p>Another one. <em>The money's come through.</em> And it wasn't an ordeal to pick it up either. $500 when you convert it to the local currency is a <em>fuckload</em> of cash. Fat stacks. I'm flush again. <em>Success.</em></p>\n<p>It's time to move on...</p>\n","<p>Manos isn't done with his new couchsurfing friend yet, so we plan to tee up again in Senegal.</p>\n<p>Ben and I have been <em>foaming</em> for Senegal for weeks; we've met a few old travellers on the way south, who have said something along the lines of &quot;Oh, you lucky bastards! To be young and in Senegal again..!&quot; as they gaze wistfully off into the distance of better times in their youth.</p>\n<p><em>Sounds good to us.</em></p>\n<p>The trouble is that I don't really know how to get in...</p>\n<p>On the map there are three ways, only two of which are potentials: Through the inland post at Rosso, or the more remote coastal post at Diama.</p>\n<p><em>Rosso's the big one.</em> It's got a reputation for being worse than a clusterfuck. A reputation for being one of the toughest, most corrupt borders on the planet.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck that.</em></p>\n<p>Diama, we don't really know anything about it.</p>\n<p>It's a black box. An unknown.</p>\n<p>But, give me a turd in one hand and a black box in the other, I'll eat what's in the box.</p>\n<p>In any case, there's two hundred clicks to travel till the roads branch.</p>\n<p><em>Better get to it.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The road is epic.</p>\n<p>Epically <em>shit.</em></p>\n<p>Fuck me. What happened to all the good tarmac??</p>\n<p>This is just a hodgepodge of awful, <em>truly awful</em> 'tarmac'.</p>\n<p>There are potholes I could park the bike in...</p>\n<p>We have to constantly weave to avoid them. I've got to be sharp, every moment.</p>\n<p>It's impossible to get up any speed, or else risk going over the handlebars.</p>\n<p>Despite playing it safe, I hit them, all the time. They're deep enough to bottom out the suspension on the Enfield completely, and we land with a bang. Not good for the bike. Not good for my spine...</p>\n<p><em>Two hundred clicks.</em></p>\n<p>Downright fucking dangerous.</p>\n<p>With the morning completely spent - and then some - we make the turnoff to Diama.</p>\n<p>And not a moment too soon; I don't reckon the bike could have handled much more of that...</p>\n<p>What's worse, is that the little oil leak that the Enfield picked up back in France has turned into a <em>haemorrhage.</em></p>\n<p>No oil = dead Enfield.</p>\n<p>What can I do about it? <em>Fuck all.</em></p>\n<p>On to Diama.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's not worse... Just <em>different.</em></p>\n<p>Soft sand; tricky. Or, corrugated, hard-dried clay; tooth shattering.</p>\n<p>It's either fluky, or bone jarring.</p>\n<p>I'm <em>shattered.</em></p>\n<p><em>This is hard work.</em></p>\n<p>The rear indicators have fallen off the Enfield. That's how bad it is.</p>\n<p>One of the mirrors let go too. Needed to stop to tighten the screws.</p>\n<p>It's like being in a paint mixer, or sitting on a jackhammer.</p>\n<p>It's a grind that's taking <em>hours.</em></p>\n<p>In the soft sand it's just <em>scary.</em> Two heavy people on a heavy bike with skinny tyres plus soft sand is a recipe for a <em>bin.</em></p>\n<p>I <em>should</em> be going faster, to 'skim' over the top instead of getting the tyres bogged down, but I dare not.</p>\n<p>My knuckles are white. I <em>wrestle</em> with the bike.</p>\n<p>I'm riding the clutch <em>constantly</em> to try and keep some control over my speed. It must be fucking <em>fried</em> by now.... But, I guess that's better than having a prang, right?</p>\n<p>Where the oil was leaking - in where the chain disappears under the engine cover - it's just a muddy mess now.</p>\n<p><em>I'm not happy with that...</em></p>\n<p>What's worse is that when I stop to check the oil level I can't <em>see</em> anything in the sight glass (no dipsticks on this bike...)</p>\n<p>That either means it's hiding somewhere else, or it's all come out and the sump is dry...</p>\n<p>There's <em>no one</em> out here to help us.</p>\n<p>We're well and truly off the grid.</p>\n<p>But, looking on the bright side, <em>we're out of the desert.</em></p>\n<p>Things went green in the blink of an eye. There are even <em>warthogs,</em> which is new... Wetlands, and a fuckload of exotic birds.</p>\n<p>I can almost <em>smell</em> the malaria... The air's gone from bone-dry to wet and heavy.</p>\n<p>We've seen fuck all in the way of 'civilisation' all day, and the sun's getting low...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Diama.</em></p>\n<p>After eight hours in the saddle, and with no lunch, this is the last thing I want to be doing.</p>\n<p><em>No choice.</em></p>\n<p><em>Here we go.</em></p>\n<p>I still don’t really know what I’m doing, I haven’t figured it out yet; I’m still worried I’m going to get my pants pulled down... At this time of the day, and this far out of the way, they have all the power; there’s not much I can do other than hope they’re good, honest people...</p>\n<p>I slap a smile on my face, puff my chest out, and try to have the right, carefree attitude I ought to have.</p>\n<p>I must look like I’ve stepped in a pile shit and I'm trying to look pleased about it...</p>\n<p>Looking around, the post is simple enough.</p>\n<p>There are three demountable buildings and a boom gate at the end. This mob obviously don’t get anywhere near the traffic that they do in the north; we’re the only ones here.</p>\n<p>We head into the first building: Gendarmerie. I'm getting the inkling that, as far as border crossings go, they're not particularly important; at least not a show-stopper...</p>\n<p>Handshakes all round. Everyone’s all smiles.</p>\n<p>There are two 'officials'. They want a 'Fish'. Not a <em>fish</em> fish, but a Fish. It's a French word, pronounced “feeesh” dunno how to spell it... Anyway, it's something you write yourself, a piece of paper with your 'details' written down. Like a cheat-sheet. Ben and I have been giving them out like candy at the squillions of checkpoints along the road. Ben's fresh out of Fish... At the last checkpoint on the way here they <em>insisted</em> on a Fish, so Ben wrote one up, on the spot, with the address 'Bag End, Hobbiton'. He can be an idiot sometimes. Hilarious, but an idiot. Can you imagine if the guy had read the Lord of the Rings??</p>\n<p>Anyway, Ben tells the border officials that he doesn't have any 'feeeesh' left.</p>\n<p>They <em>lose</em> it.</p>\n<p>I mean <em>really</em> go off the handle.</p>\n<p><em>Pissing</em> themselves laughing.</p>\n<p>Ben and I share a look...</p>\n<p>They're in <em>tears.</em></p>\n<p>In the end, we're laughing at them laughing - how can we not? We're deliriously tired, and the laughter is infectious.</p>\n<p>Laughing my head off with Mauritanian Gendarmes.</p>\n<p>How did life come to this?</p>\n<p>If the rest of the border is going to be this laid back it's gonna be a deadset cakewalk...</p>\n<p>The officials compose themselves - still giggling - and take down Ben's basic details.</p>\n<p>Handshakes all round, and we’re on to the Douanes.</p>\n<p>Ben's sitting this one out.</p>\n<p><em>Envious.</em></p>\n<p>I step in the door and it's immediately obvious that this mob don’t have the same sense of humour as the Gendarmes... There are about five or six of them in uniform playing cards on the floor.</p>\n<p>I've obviously interrupted them. <em>They're not impressed.</em></p>\n<p>I’m big smiles and handshakes all round.</p>\n<p>The reception I get is <em>frosty.</em></p>\n<p>I’m the only one here so I get to deal with the top man. He’s got a hard head and looks mildly pissed off. Must've been a good hand... He ushers me into his office and we sit down at his desk.</p>\n<p>He fingers through my passport and my rego papers.</p>\n<p>“Now you give me ten euro.”</p>\n<p>Red flag...</p>\n<p>&quot;Por-qwaar?&quot;</p>\n<p>Apparently, it’s for taking the motorbike out of the country. I explain that I don’t have euros and he says that 4,000 ouguiya will be fine...</p>\n<p><em>I smell a rat;</em> I don’t remember ever giving anyone money to get a bike <em>out</em> of a country.</p>\n<p>In, yes.</p>\n<p>Out, no.</p>\n<p>And ten euros out here is a bucketload of cash...</p>\n<p>I tell him I’m not going to pay it unless I can get a <em>receipt</em> for it (I’ve read, somewhere, that this is a good ploy to avoid paying frivolous bribes masked as 'legitimate' payments). As a cherry on top I ask him what his name is and, while I'm laying it on with a trowel, I ask him what his bosses name is too...</p>\n<p>It doesn't go down well. <em>At all.</em></p>\n<p>He goes <em>wild.</em></p>\n<p>He stands up, nearly knocking his chair over, and tells me that if I don’t like it I can go the eight hours back to Nouakchott - finger pointing and all.</p>\n<p>Almost spat it at me...</p>\n<p><em>Touché.</em></p>\n<p>I leave the shack without my papers and go and talk with the <em>other</em> Douane, who’s having a friendly chat with Ben outside.</p>\n<p>I try and tactfully weasel out of him whether or not I need to pay...</p>\n<p>He just shrugs his shoulders...</p>\n<p>Ben’s got no idea either, he's done this as many times as I have...</p>\n<p>Ben - to his credit - doesn’t suggest I do anything either way.</p>\n<p>If I was in his shoes - starving and tired - I'd be saying pay the man and fucking get on with it, <em>for fucks sake...</em></p>\n<p>He’s just happy to sit and be.</p>\n<p>He's a better man than I am...</p>\n<p>I head back in for round two.</p>\n<p>It lasts fifteen minutes. I defend with my language barrier, and then jab with my 'por-qwarr?'</p>\n<p>It’s like trying to learn a new dance when you don’t know the steps; you’re going to tread on some toes.</p>\n<p>I’m about to cave. <em>It really is too late in the day for this...</em></p>\n<p>But <em>he blinks first,</em> and says that I can take the motorbike out of the country for 4,000 ouguiya <em>with</em> a receipt, <em>or</em> I can have it for 2,000 ouguiya <em>without</em> a receipt.</p>\n<p><em>Bang.</em> Now I <em>know</em> it's bullshit.</p>\n<p>Tasting blood in the water, I <em>pile</em> it on, <em>demanding</em> that he stamps my papers and lets me out of the country for <em>nothing.</em></p>\n<p><em>As he fucking should...</em></p>\n<p>The hard-nosed prick won’t budge though; he’s still seething angry.</p>\n<p>With the fresh shot of indignation I manage to bitch and moan and argue for another fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>He’s having <em>none</em> of it.</p>\n<p>We're going in circles again...</p>\n<p><em>I cave.</em> Principles be damned... I chalk it up as a half-win at half-price, and I reckon he does too. <em>I feel like I'm learning.</em></p>\n<p>He hand writes something illegible in my passport, stamps it, and that’s that.</p>\n<p><em>Moving on.</em></p>\n<p>I grab Ben’s passport (he stays put) and head to Immigration.</p>\n<p>The post official is a squat, chubby fella with a moustache. His appearance makes him seem like a nice guy, like a big teddy bear. Thoroughly harmless.</p>\n<p>His fat fingers flip through the passports.</p>\n<p>He wants to see registration papers for the bike.</p>\n<p>He wants to see insurance for the bike.</p>\n<p>He wants to see the laissez-passer for the bike.</p>\n<p>He wants to see a license for the bike.</p>\n<p>He’s <em>Immigration</em> for fuck's sake - My bike is <em>not</em> immigrating out of Mauritania - it can't, <em>it's not a human...</em></p>\n<p>The bike is none of his business... I think...</p>\n<p>He’s probably trying to trip me up, find holes, catch me out, but he's not getting it... This peanut can't see the woods from the trees: Invalid insurance; no international drivers license; no carnet de passage, and he can’t find anything to put me over the barrel for... <em>Thick in the head.</em></p>\n<p>All I need from this guy is an 'exit stamp' in the passports.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: In French, an ink stamp is called a 'tampon'.</p>\n<p>Go figure...</p>\n<p>It's the only time I've ever had to ask another bloke to 'give me a tampon'...</p>\n<p>Anyway, my thick peanut butter moustachioed teddy bear post official has run out of ammunition, and proceeds to tampon both our passports. He hands them back to me with all my papers.</p>\n<p>&quot;Now you give me ten euros...&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Ha!</em></p>\n<p>What a fucking <em>stooge.</em> This guy needs to take lessons from the bloke at Customs next door; the <em>moment</em> he handed those stamped passports back to me he lost all leverage.</p>\n<p>Shit, even <em>I</em> know that!!</p>\n<p>I tell him that I have to go and give my friend back his passport, and he accepts this as a fair excuse to leave the building.</p>\n<p>He just watches from the doorframe, helpless, as Ben and I kit up and jump on the bike. As I hit the ignition I make eye contact with Peanut, who waves me to come back inside. I wave back, and we ride off.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is the side of the two borders that gives me the willies. Ten euros will seem like fuck all if their reputation is to be believed...</p>\n<p>Will the black box have another turd in it?</p>\n<p>Riding up on the bike I’m already having a win; what freaked me out most about our last border was how big and busy, frenetic and confusing it was. Out here, now, there’s none of that madness; just three, simple, small shacks.</p>\n<p>We’ve gone through the shit to get here - four extra hours of difficult, dead-arse riding that we didn’t have to do, and now we get to reap the reward.</p>\n<p>Even before I turn the key off we get mobbed by a small posse of fixers, money changers, and people flogging useless shit.</p>\n<p>Because we’re the only ones at the post we come in for a fair whack of attention.</p>\n<p>We brush them off as best we can and head to one of the buildings, which turns out to be half Police, half Immigration.</p>\n<p>Behind a steel-barred 'window' is one fat fuck in uniform, sitting at a desk, surrounded by stacks of papers and stamps. He looks like he’s stuck in a prison cell...</p>\n<p>We hand him our passports, he fingers through them and - without a word - tampons our entry stamps in.</p>\n<p>Piece of fucking cake. <em>We're in.</em></p>\n<p>He casually puts the passports down on his desk, leans back in his chair and slowly, leisurely puts his feet up. With a self-satisfied, smug smile on his face he says something in French that has the word “euros” in it.</p>\n<p><em>Bastard...</em></p>\n<p>I explain that we don’t know <em>any</em> French, even though Ben’s got a half-decent handle on it...</p>\n<p>“You give ten euros, you give me <em>money.</em>”</p>\n<p>Well, he’s got the passports - he’s got the power.</p>\n<p>In a way I’m almost <em>relieved</em>, I was expecting way, <em>way</em> worse than ten euros as a starting point. So that's as bad as it can get... Not bad...</p>\n<p>I look to Ben. He can take this one.</p>\n<p>“Dis euro? Por-qwar?”</p>\n<p>“Service fee.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Service fee??</em> Por-qwar?”</p>\n<p>“You pay because you late. After 'dis-wheat' hour (Dis-wheat is eighteen, so, 6pm) everyone pay dis euro. You give me ten euros.”</p>\n<p>Ben and I exchange looks with scrunched up faces and a bit of a sly grin.</p>\n<p>We check our watches.</p>\n<p>It’s 5:45pm. <em>He’s 15 minutes off...</em></p>\n<p>Ben and I are grinning like idiots at each other.</p>\n<p>I point this dickhead to the time on my watch. “Ce dis <em>set</em> currant-sank... hmmm?”.</p>\n<p>He looks confused, then looks at his own watch, then looks angry.</p>\n<p>He grabs our passports and <em>slams</em> them down under the hole in the iron-bars.</p>\n<p>Fuck yes!! <em>Victory!</em></p>\n<p>We walk away laughing our heads off.</p>\n<p>The entry stamps mean that Ben and I are now clear to enter the country, but I still need to get papers from Customs for the bike before we can ride out.</p>\n<p>I tell Ben to hold the fort while I go and sort out a laissez-passer.</p>\n<p>The Douanes is different set-up; small window, so I knock on the door and step inside.</p>\n<p>There are three guns hanging on the wall opposite the door, and a small TV playing a music channel that's half static above my head.</p>\n<p>There’s only one guy in the room, sitting at a desk.</p>\n<p>He’s <em>ginormous.</em></p>\n<p>A fucking <em>beast</em> of a man, with boots up on the desk and his hands behind his head while he watches the TV.</p>\n<p>He gets up...</p>\n<p>Maybe only a shade taller than me, but he looks as strong as a fucking ox.</p>\n<p>He looks like he’s about to <em>explode</em> out of his t-shirt.</p>\n<p>It’s handshakes and smiles as I go through the usual explanations: I don’t speak French, do you speak English? Can I get a laissez-passer. Ok? Yes, good...</p>\n<p>We make some small talk in broken English while he checks my bike rego and writes up the LP.</p>\n<p>It’s all very jovial and good natured. Friendly. The gentle giant.</p>\n<p>Thank Christ for that. I wouldn't want to see this bloke crack the shits...</p>\n<p>All done and finished, he hands me back all my papers and a completed and stamped LP.</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>beautiful.</em></p>\n<p>While we’re still talking and laughing I shove the papers into the inner pocket of my jacket, and zip it all the way to my neck.</p>\n<p>&quot;Now you give me ten euros...&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>'Euros' are my new red flag; I <em>know</em> it's a total load of shit.</p>\n<p>I tell him that I don’t <em>have</em> any euros, and I’m <em>not</em> paying it. I go to leave, and open the door about a quarter of the way.</p>\n<p>He stops the door with his huge hand and <em>slams</em> it shut while I'm still gripping the handle.</p>\n<p><em>He locks the door.</em></p>\n<p><em>Shit...</em></p>\n<p>He’s the <em>opposite</em> of happy.</p>\n<p>“<em>No!</em> You pay! You give me money. <em>Now!</em>”</p>\n<p>It's like being yelled at by a fucking walrus.</p>\n<p>I’m distinctly aware of the guns on the wall and on his arms. The ones on the wall look like the AK-47’s meaner big brother... I’m not sure which ones I’m more scared of; this guy looks like he's about to turn into the black Incredible Hulk...</p>\n<p>I'm <em>full</em> of adrenaline. <em>Fizzing</em>.</p>\n<p>Everything's going <em>fuzzy,</em> in my eyes and in my head it's like a whacked out dreamland.</p>\n<p>Despite the nugget in the back of my pants I stick to my guns and tell him I’m not paying for it. I go over the usual shtick.</p>\n<p>He’s furious like <em>I’m</em> the one cheating <em>him</em>. He’s grabbed my arm like Popeye grabbing a tin of spinach. <em>Squeezing.</em></p>\n<p>“You pay or you give paper back! <em>NOW!!</em>”</p>\n<p>He’s trying to get into my jacket, and I'm trying to stop him.</p>\n<p>In the wrestle (that I'm actually winning, he can't get at the zip...) the notepad of LP's on his desk catches my attention.</p>\n<p>I can see scrawled on it <em>'2,500 CFA'</em>.</p>\n<p>2,500 Central African Francs.</p>\n<p>I do quick and dirty math and realise it’s only about five bucks...</p>\n<p>I point it out to him.</p>\n<p>That <em>really</em> pisses him off.</p>\n<p>I tell him that that’s all I’ll pay and that I don’t have <em>any</em> money, <em>but my friend does.</em> I just want him to unlock that fucking door so I can get out...</p>\n<p>There's a mob forming outside the dirty, smeared window...</p>\n<p>My captor’s sticking to his guns but he’s taken the bait about Ben having all the money. He unlocks the door and tells one of the gathered mob to go and fetch him. Ben comes and stands in the doorway and, as always, he’s ice cold.</p>\n<p><em>The Iceman.</em></p>\n<p>Despite the yelling he seems utterly nonplussed by it all. Bored, again.</p>\n<p>I bet I looked fucking <em>frantic</em> in comparison.</p>\n<p>Ben's changed money with the fixers while he waited for me, so he's got some Francs. He’s only got it in denominations of a thousand, so he gives me three notes.</p>\n<p>I chuck the 3,000 CFA onto the desk like it's a smokebomb, like a squid shooting ink.</p>\n<p>As I do, a short, squat, older guy in uniform pushes past the fixers and comes into the room. He makes no introductions...</p>\n<p><em>He looks like the boss...</em></p>\n<p>My gigantor friend bellows “you leave now!!” and shoves us both out the door.</p>\n<p>I’m not about to ask for change...</p>\n<p><em>Victory number two!</em> Kind of...</p>\n<p>We’re <em>done</em> here.</p>\n<p>On the bike and onwards into Senegal.</p>\n<p>It's nothing but glorious, fresh tarmac.</p>\n","<p><em>Senegal.</em></p>\n<p>Now <em>this</em> is <em>Africa!</em></p>\n<p><em>Green.</em></p>\n<p>Colourful, patterned dresses with big headscarves.</p>\n<p>Carrying stuff on their heads.</p>\n<p>Babies in a sling.</p>\n<p><em>Proper</em> Africa.</p>\n<p>We roll into St. Louis, which is a big scummy beachside shanty town in the very north of the country.</p>\n<p>It’s messy in places but it’s got its own charm to it, I guess. It used to be the capital, so it’s full of old derelict French colonial buildings from the 'glory days'.</p>\n<p>We shack up in a cheap 'auberge', which is French for hostel.</p>\n<p>I reckon we’re the only ones here...</p>\n<p>It’s late, and immediately our minds are on food. It’s been a long, tough day and we haven’t eaten since omelettes and croissants for breakfast this morning.</p>\n<p>We’re <em>ravenous.</em></p>\n<p>Surprisingly, we manage to find a fairly modern, western, diner-ish style place in town.</p>\n<p>Burgers and chips. Of course...</p>\n<p>They come out to us and they're <em>massive</em> and <em>greasy</em> and filled with everything they had in the kitchen; beef, eggs, chips, tonnes of salad, all swimming in sauce.</p>\n<p>Too big to fit your mouth around...</p>\n<p>Two bucks a pop. Yep, <em>two dollars.</em></p>\n<p>It’s just what the doctor ordered, so we each order two.</p>\n<p>They disappear in quick succession and the two zombies are starting to rise again like Lazarus.</p>\n<p>We polish the feast down with a couple of the local brews, the first drinks since Tony left off with his beer and rum in Nouadhibou.</p>\n<p>We’re both fucking <em>thrilled</em> to be in Senegal.</p>\n<p>The 'real' Africa.</p>\n<p><em>Life is good.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Delirious.</em> Utterly exhausted.</p>\n<p>Vaguely nauseous.</p>\n<p>A stonking headache.</p>\n<p>I can't stop <em>sweating.</em></p>\n<p>But it’s not hot...</p>\n<p>Half-awake, half-asleep, tossing and turning in restlessness that stays for hours. I can't shake it.</p>\n<p>It must be nearly sunrise...</p>\n<p>My brain is flying all over the place from one strange thought after the next. It won’t <em>settle</em>. It won't let me sleep.</p>\n<p>I'm <em>crushingly</em> tired.</p>\n<p>Fucking awful.</p>\n<p>One clear thought is coming through, over and over again: <em>Malaria.</em></p>\n<p>Symptoms for malaria include fever (tick), headache (tick), chills (nope), sweats (tick), fatigue (tick), nausea (half-a-tick), vomiting (nope). Death (nope).</p>\n<p><em>Can’t forget death...</em></p>\n<p>I know this because Ben's had it. Got it in East Africa.</p>\n<p>He said it was “curious to feel what it would feel like to be dying”.</p>\n<p>Joy of joys.</p>\n<p>Malaria moves fast... And - just for fun - if it's not treated early enough, and the malaria multiplies past some certain 'critical amount', you’re basically fucked; there’s nothing medicine can do to bring it back under control and you end up, eventually, slowly, dead.</p>\n<p>I can explain the fatigue, but the rest? No.</p>\n<p>I’m waiting for the shakes and chills to confirm it, and then I'm fucking off to hospital.</p>\n<p>I’m <em>shattered.</em></p>\n<p>Without warning, my guts turns into a puddle.</p>\n<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>\n<p>I violently shit my entire body weight through the eye of a needle.</p>\n<p>I <em>did</em> make it to the toilet.</p>\n<p><em>Barely...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I shit more than I thought I could possibly have in me... And then more again.</p>\n<p>I beat a path between my bed and the toilet for the whole morning till midday.</p>\n<p>After holding out for twelve hours, I can't do it anymore; I give in to my bloated nausea, head to the can, and throw up. <em>Hard.</em></p>\n<p>One of those chunders that seems to break the laws of physics because the diameter of it looks like the size of your head as it’s coming flying out at a clip.</p>\n<p>An <em>enormous</em> volume of vomit.</p>\n<p>Despite sitting in my guts for the whole night and the whole morning, the two burgers haven’t digested one bit.</p>\n<p>There's something odd about that...</p>\n<p><em>I need to chew more...</em></p>\n<p>By the time I’m done the only thing hurting anymore are my stomach muscles from being wrung dry like a wet towel.</p>\n<p>I feel like hell, but it’s an improvement.</p>\n<p>I crash back into bed, and, <em>somehow,</em> sleep comes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>To sit or to kneel?</em> That is the question...</p>\n<p><em>Three days</em> of asking the question.</p>\n<p>What a life.</p>\n<p>I can't say much about St. Louis, other than to give a disturbingly accurate description of the fittings and décor of the shitter...</p>\n<p>I never had the courage to go out of spitting distance of the toilet, till now.</p>\n<p>I wander back into the world like a man crippled.</p>\n<p>Absolutely wracked.</p>\n<p>Despite ticking the 'vomit box' for malaria symptoms, I never got the other two: chills and death. Apparently the chills are the dead giveaway, so it seems that I'm out of the woods on that one...</p>\n<p><em>Lucky but unlucky.</em></p>\n<p>Thank Christ for Ben. He kept me on a strict diet of bananas and bottled water. I don't know how I would have fed myself if I was alone...</p>\n","<p><em>Dakar.</em></p>\n<p><em>The</em> Dakar.</p>\n<p>A big, bustling city. One of the biggest in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Perched on the very tip of the western bulge of the continent. You literally can’t get any further west without jumping on a boat.</p>\n<p>Dakar is a <em>proper</em> city, with good roads, bridges, big buildings, supermarkets and all that jazz.</p>\n<p>There’s always a <em>tonne</em> of traffic and the cars are all beat up piles of shit that spew thick black smoke. The pollution here is so bad that we can stare straight at the dimmed-out sun, no worries - just like in that dust storm in the Sahara.</p>\n<p>I feel like a pack-a-day smoker...</p>\n<p>There are pockets of modernity here, with some of the big name hotel chains setting up shop, but besides all that, it’s a touch old and decrepit and grimey; just how we like it.</p>\n<p>I’m pretty sure most tourists don’t see much of Dakar other than the pool-side bar. Needless to say, Ben and I aren’t staying in those sorts of places. We settle for a shitty, double-room on a roof, with a big, gaping hole above the door where the air conditioner used to be.</p>\n<p><em>Cheap as chips.</em> The mosquitos come and go as they please...</p>\n<p>Manos - the sly dog - has managed to find another house to stay at - for free. He also happens to be rooting his host... <em>Vamos Manos!</em></p>\n<p>We've spent three weeks loitering here, mostly just surfing. One time we found a washed up goats carcass on the shore... <em>Delightful.</em></p>\n<p>The food here is a heart attack. A uni-student's wet-dream: hot chip and sauce sandwich, in a baguette, with boiled eggs and heroin.</p>\n<p>Fucking delicious, fucking addictive, and that's just for <em>breakfast</em>...</p>\n<p>I've serviced the Enfield - which took a while to arrange - but time just happens to be something I've got a lot of here; the new credit card is yet to arrive...</p>\n<p>The mechanics were awesome, they didn't mind me using their workshop, and they even let me share their lunch. Everyone eats out of the same big bowl - rice and fish and 'sauce'. No one seems to care that their hands are covered in black grease and shit...</p>\n<p>The bike is spick-and-span after a much needed clean. I've glued the indicators back on and tightened up that mirror.</p>\n<p>I've replaced the gasket where I reckon I'm having that that pesky oil leak. Fingers crossed on that one...</p>\n<p>The air filter had more sand in it than a beach. <em>Suboptimal...</em></p>\n<p>Other than that, it was just a 'standard' service. Oil changes and other simple enough stuff, and she's ready to go again...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Christmas comes, and goes, and still we wait.</p>\n<p>Skinny black Santa is <em>really</em> weird...</p>\n<p>Christmas here is less about Jesus and more about fireworks. My kind of Christmas...</p>\n<p>Poor Ben isn’t a fan.</p>\n<p>He's an Afghanistan Veteran. He's seen war. He doesn't talk about it. He involuntarily shits his pants anytime someone lets off an especially large firework; which is roughly one an hour.</p>\n<p>The poor bastard's been on a hair trigger all week, and goes into a half sprawl <em>every single time</em> something goes bang - he can't help it. I guess I'd shit my pants too...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Finally.</em></p>\n<p>The new credit card has crossed the seas.</p>\n<p>Getting it 'activated' from Senegal is a headache; the bank wants to do a bunch of security tests over the phone before I can use it... Some fun conversations there...</p>\n<p>I throw some money into the new account and head out to test it on a cash machine.</p>\n<p>It crunches the cash, first time. <em>Beautiful.</em></p>\n<p>I go and change what's left of my $500 worth of Ouguiya into US dollars. It’s a smart move to have an exchangeable currency and everyone's been doing it except me.</p>\n<p>I take out enough cash in Senegalese money to top me up to a combined $1,000 worth and then go and make the exchange at a local shop. Fat stacks. <em>No dramas.</em></p>\n<p>I’m thrilled that that’s finally done, it's the last box to be ticked, and we can finally move on to somewhere new.</p>\n<p>To celebrate Ben and I go surfing all day.</p>\n<p><em>What a life.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hit the shower to wash off a particularly soupy day in the ocean.</p>\n<p>When I get back to the room, Ben’s complaining that he thinks his pocket music player got stolen.</p>\n<p>&quot;You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel...&quot;</p>\n<p><em>He's not in the mood for a laugh.</em></p>\n<p>He’s got his bag emptied out on his bed and he’s rifling through all his clothes and pockets.</p>\n<p>It's just a cheap, shitty little music player. Not worth a lot, and I have a little chuckle to myself that I’m not going to have to listen to him playing that shitty reggae anymore.</p>\n<p>It's a win.</p>\n<p>For Ben though, it's <em>devastating;</em> it’s rare for Ben not to have the headphones in, listening to music in his spare time - which is a lot of the time.</p>\n<p>I offer my commiserations, but mostly I’m interested to see how this is all going to pan out with the staff at the hotel... Should be good sport.</p>\n<p>He’s <em>frantically</em> checking, re-checking and re-checking his stuff again.</p>\n<p>I notice that my leather bike jacket - which hasn’t moved from its spot on the table in weeks - has moved, just a smidge.</p>\n<p>I go to it, and absentmindedly touch the pocket where I keep my GPS.</p>\n<p>The pocket’s <em>flat...</em></p>\n<p>The zip's undone.</p>\n<p><em>Empty.</em></p>\n<p>Ohhhhhhh.</p>\n<p><em>Violated. Nausea.</em></p>\n<p>My head becomes so heavy it's going to roll off my shoulders.</p>\n<p><em>No no no no...</em></p>\n<p>My eyes bulge. I don’t blink. <em>I'm paralysed.</em></p>\n<p>In the mush of a thousand thoughts that fly all at once in the next second, there’s the thought that this is <em>just a mistake.</em></p>\n<p><em>A misunderstanding.</em></p>\n<p>I thump my hand down onto the opposite front pocket.</p>\n<p><em>Flat.</em></p>\n<p><em>That’s where I keep my camera...</em></p>\n<p>Fuck. Oh <em>fuck</em> no!</p>\n<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!</p>\n<p>I throw open my jacket. The inside pocket's unzipped. Wallet. Gone.</p>\n<p><em>Panic.</em></p>\n<p><em>Someone's been in my jacket...!</em></p>\n<p>My license, my cash, my three credit cards, <em>my fucking just-activated credit card!!</em></p>\n<p>The grand... The thousand... Oh Jesus...</p>\n<p><em>I'm frozen again.</em></p>\n<p>Please please <em>please...</em></p>\n<p>I slam my hand on the super-secret pocket. <em>Flat.</em></p>\n<p>I open the pocket. <em>Nothing.</em></p>\n<p><em>Cleaned out.</em></p>\n<p>My mind is a wild blur of a million thoughts and permutations of the past and the future. And the <em>crushing</em> present. It's all happening, all at once, and at light-speed.</p>\n<p>Ben’s stopped what he's doing and has been watching me: Frenzied movement then freezing, another frenzied movement and then freezing again, with wounded-animal-noises in between.</p>\n<p>He’s joined the dots that we’ve been <em>fucked,</em> and that I’ve copped it far worse than he has.</p>\n<p>We share a look...</p>\n<p>I make a dive at my saddlebags. Everything in my jacket that's been nicked can be replaced. It’ll be a bitch, but they’re not <em>irreplaceable.</em></p>\n<p><em>All the irreplaceables are in my bags.</em></p>\n<p>Laptop with all my everything on it.</p>\n<p>All my official bike papers.</p>\n<p>My <em>passports.</em></p>\n<p>My bike keys.</p>\n<p>And, <em>most of all</em>, my journal thingo... I'd fucking cry...</p>\n<p><em>It couldn't...</em></p>\n<p>Half furious, half gibbering mess, I tear my saddlebags apart.</p>\n<p>I can see straightaway the laptop is there. I dig into my bag-within-a-bag-within-another-bag and <em>there’s the journal.</em></p>\n<p>I breathe...</p>\n<p>Thank fucking <em>Christ.</em></p>\n<p>The impending crushing sadness of an irreplaceable loss has flipped into <em>pure fury.</em></p>\n<p><em>I'm going to fucking kill someone...</em></p>\n<p>I do a sound off of the other irreplaceables; the papers, passports, the keys.</p>\n<p>They're all there.</p>\n<p>Silver linings on a big, shitty cloud.</p>\n<p>Ben and I both want to go and kick in the doors of the cleaner’s rooms. Go all SWAT team on the fuckers. Search <em>everything.</em></p>\n<p>There are three of them, they’re all young, around twenty-somethings.</p>\n<p>They seemed so <em>sweet</em>...</p>\n<p>It's so out of character. How do you go and accuse someone like that of something like this?</p>\n<p>Let's find out...</p>\n<p>I throw pants on. We run down the stairs and raise the alarm to the owner of the hotel; a gross, sweaty, slob of an old, short, fat, white <em>Frenchman.</em></p>\n<p>I’m suspicious of <em>everyone,</em> but I can’t hang around to see where this goes - I’ve got three credit cards to cancel...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I video call my parents. It's four in the morning their time...</p>\n<p>Pretty fucking rude, really, but what am I supposed to do?</p>\n<p>They both fucking panic when they see my call coming through, knowing that it must be pretty bad... I explain to them the situation, they go to DEFCON 1, bail me out, and make the necessary calls to the banks.</p>\n<p><em>A huge effort from them.</em></p>\n<p>That'll be an interesting conversation; “Hey, you know my son’s Visa card that you only <em>just</em> activated a few hours ago? Yeah, it’s been stolen in Senegal, West Africa. Can you cancel it and send out a new one? Thanks.”</p>\n<p>Once that’s all taken care of I head back to where the forensic investigation is going on upstairs.</p>\n<p>Here's the latest:</p>\n<p>It seems someone’s climbed in through the hole above the door where the air conditioner used to be, and busted the lock on the way down with their feet.</p>\n<p>I can’t imagine the little cleaners being able to do that...</p>\n<p><em>Suspect number one</em> now becomes a random dude who came into our room this morning and asked if he could charge his phone in our power outlet. At the time it seemed weird, but now it's starting to look downright suspicious, like he might have been <em>casing the room</em> or something.</p>\n<p>The hotel mob know the guy we’re talking about, but the hotel standards here in Africa aren’t quite like what they are in the rest of the world, so they haven’t taken down <em>any</em> of his details.</p>\n<p>And wouldn’t you know it, <em>he checked-out this afternoon.</em></p>\n<p>Our best description of the guy: Black. With longish hair.</p>\n<p><em>That's it...</em></p>\n<p>Not much for the authorities to go by...</p>\n<p>The wife of the French slob (a gorgeous, fiery young local girl) promises that she’ll find out who this guy is, track him down, and get our things back.</p>\n<p><em>Exact a bit of African justice.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fuck yeah.</em></p>\n<p>She seems to be even more pissed off about all this than we are. I think she’s just relishing the chance to vent her spleen at anyone. At times she’s even chastising Ben and I. Like <em>we</em> did something fucking wrong...</p>\n<p>The firebrand gets us to 'dictate a statement' of 'the facts', which she translates and scribes into French. She's fucking <em>loving</em> the drama.</p>\n<p>The sweaty white blob escorts me, with the statement, to the police station, which is just around the corner.</p>\n<p>On the walk over he’s talking to me in bits of French and bits of English. He keeps grabbing my hand or arm to guide me around corners. His little fat fingers are all wet and clammy, and it’s <em>really</em> grossing me out. This might even be the most disturbing part of the day so far. I’m feeling pretty sorry for myself, but my pity is starting to shift over to the drama queen.</p>\n<p><em>How does she...?</em></p>\n<p>I’m <em>squeaming</em> as mental images of what goes on come up unwarranted in my head. It’s sickening, and just <em>sad.</em> I guess money talks... but the blob wouldn’t even have that much, <em>surely,</em> I mean... the hotel's <em>shit...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's clear that the cop's aren't gonna do fuck-all about this...</p>\n<p>They're not going to file a report tonight. They're closed over the weekend. They'll do it on Monday.</p>\n<p>Don't know what I expected...</p>\n<p>So it seems that it’s just going to be damage control from here on out; we’re not going to get this guy...</p>\n<p>What's pissing me off the most is that we’ve been here for weeks, <em>weeks</em>, wanting to move on and now I’m going to have to fucking wait <em>again</em> while the new credit card comes in.</p>\n<p>Merry fucking Christmas.</p>\n","<p><em>Happy new year...</em></p>\n<p>I haven't done much.</p>\n<p>I've printed a saved copy of my drivers license and got it laminated. <em>That's my replacement.</em> It's blurry.</p>\n<p>It looks like shit.</p>\n<p>It's not gonna work...</p>\n<p>Just when I thought my travel papers couldn't get any less convincing...</p>\n<p>The robbery has taken the jam right out of my doughnut, and I’m starting to become pretty antisocial; all I want to do is read books in our room and study some French lessons that I pirated online.</p>\n<p>I’m utterly disinterested in anything else.</p>\n<p>All Ben wants to do is smoke shisha and go out to bars. Poor bastard's <em>dying</em> for a wingman, but what’s worse is he doesn’t want to do it alone, so he’s putting the pressure back on me.</p>\n<p>When I don't go out, he doesn't go out. Instead he just sulks in our room, with no music.</p>\n<p>We’re at polar opposites at the moment, and the disconnect means we’re starting to get on each other’s tits.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Ben gets lucky.</em></p>\n<p>He was picked up at a bar by a stunner of a girl from Niger (pronounced knee-share in the French tongue, I'd been saying Niger the same way I'd say tiger...)</p>\n<p>Her names 'Asse' (Arse-ay).</p>\n<p><em>Piss funny.</em></p>\n<p>Ben's punching well above his weight if you ask me. He's been wearing a constant, smug grin on his face that's never been there before.</p>\n<p>One day, I came home from a surf, and my bed reeked of sex.</p>\n<p><em>Reeked of it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fucking disgusting filthy motherfuckers.</em></p>\n<p>Sex isn’t the most pleasant smell in the world, even when you’re the one helping to make it, but when it’s not yours it’s positively <em>vile.</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank.</em></p>\n<p>And now I’ve got to fucking <em>sleep</em> in it?</p>\n<p>Is that a joke??</p>\n<p>I can understand where his head was at; the room we’re in has one queen bed and one single bed, and through the luck of the dice I nabbed the queen when we first arrived.</p>\n<p>Cramming two people onto that small single bed wouldn’t have really worked... But, if the shoe was on the other foot, I wouldn’t have fucked in <em>his</em> bed.</p>\n<p><em>No fucking way.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Not a word was spoken...</p>\n<p><em>Nothing.</em></p>\n<p>And now he's disappeared...</p>\n<p>I haven't seen him in <em>days.</em> I reckon he's had enough of me.</p>\n<p>It's been a boon to be alone again.</p>\n<p>But now, I'm in the shit.</p>\n<p>I was relying on Ben financially after the thief took all my money and my means of getting money. With Ben M.I.A. I'd assumed I could get cash with the 'emergency credit card' that's been sent out.</p>\n<p><em>It doesn't work.</em></p>\n<p>I've tried everywhere...</p>\n<p>A money transfer can't be done either, because it's the fucking weekend.</p>\n<p><em>Everything's shut.</em></p>\n<p>All the money in the world and no way to get it, and no one to prop me up in the meanwhile.</p>\n<p>No way of contacting Ben.</p>\n<p>I have 50 CFA in my pocket.</p>\n<p><em>That’s 10 cents.</em></p>\n<p>$0.10, It’s gotta last me till either Ben decides he's done fucking Asse and comes back, or till Monday when I can get a money transfer...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You’ve never seen someone haggle so hard for street peanuts in your life.</p>\n<p>They're all I eat, they're all I can afford.</p>\n<p>Another day passes, with still no Ben. More street peanuts and tap water.</p>\n<p>It's getting properly skinny now...</p>\n<p>Money is like toilet paper. When you have a full roll you go through it like it’s an unlimited resource, using as much as you feel like to the point of being wasteful. Who cares? Plenty more toilet paper where that came from... But as the roll runs out you start to get more sparing with it, all the way to the bitter end where you’d be amazed what you can do with just one square.</p>\n<p>In a word - you get creative.</p>\n<p>The real trouble comes when you think that there are more rolls; so you use the one you’re on with reckless abandon right to the end, only to find out that you've just finished the last one...</p>\n<p>Ever wiped your arse with the cardboard roll?</p>\n<p>This is the money equivalent...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The lack of calories is hitting home, hard.</p>\n<p>Still no Ben. I've gone through my ten cents. I wonder how long I can go without eating till I get in trouble...</p>\n<p>I hate this room. I hate this place.</p>\n<p>I'm moping around the hotel, conserving energy.</p>\n<p>The three cleaning girls - oblivious to my situation - invite me to come join them for lunch.</p>\n<p>Two days ago I'd mentally accused them as thieves...</p>\n<p>Fatima, Fatu and Fatma. I have to ask them a second time to be sure I've got that right...</p>\n<p>Fatima’s done the cook up. It's a <em>massive</em> dish of food in a steel bowl the size of a bus hubcap.</p>\n<p>A whole fish sitting on top of caramelised onions and carrots and some other mystery vegetable, all sitting on a bed of oily, greasy, sticky brown rice.</p>\n<p><em>My eyes are like saucers.</em></p>\n<p>The smell is too much for my hunger...</p>\n<p>We all sit on the floor next to the 'kitchen', in what feels like a shed.</p>\n<p><em>We eat.</em></p>\n<p><em>It's the best thing that I’ve ever eaten.</em></p>\n<p>Food never tasted this good. <em>Ever.</em></p>\n<p>They jabber on in French while I try to be calm and polite whilst <em>shovelling</em> the food into my face.</p>\n<p>I’m doing the whole 'monkey-see monkey-do' routine, copying their eating technique.</p>\n<p>Apparently doing everything with your right hand is the go, or maybe they're just all right handed... Everyone’s grabbing chunks of the choice bits of fish and <em>flicking it</em> into everyone else’s part of the hubcap. My side is filling up quicker than I can make it disappear, even though I'm doing my level best.</p>\n<p>They only know a smidgin of English, so I try out my smidgin of French from what I’ve learnt from hours and hours of my pirated lessons.</p>\n<p>I thought it was pretty good...</p>\n<p>They think it’s <em>hysterical.</em></p>\n<p>I’m saying some pretty mundane stuff, and they’re laughing like I’m a comic genius.</p>\n<p>We talk about my family, and when conversation turns to girlfriends they’re rolling on the floor in stitches.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think it was that funny...</p>\n<p>As we keep eating and talking and sharing and laughing, sitting on the concrete floor, I think that this might be the single nicest way I’ve ever eaten food with people.</p>\n<p><em>Ever.</em></p>\n<p>It’s all about <em>sharing.</em> Sharing food, sharing stories.</p>\n<p>It’s the anti-thesis of your typical dinner in the West; everyone with their own plate of food, on the couch maybe, glued to the idiot box probably.</p>\n<p>Bloody <em>rectangles...</em></p>\n<p>The Western way of having a meal would seem completely <em>retarded</em> to these three. <em>It would take away what meals are all about.</em></p>\n<p>I'm as happy as a pig in shit, grinning like an idiot. This is just so <em>pleasant</em> on so many levels.</p>\n<p>Then I notice Fatima's hands.</p>\n<p>Then Fatma's, then Fatu's.</p>\n<p>These three young girls have the hands of ninety-year-olds.</p>\n<p>Weathered and withered and covered in lines that tell of a hard, long life. It’s in stark contrast to the bubbly young women that they are, always laughing and smiling. It saddens me a bit.</p>\n<p>Even though I’m the hungry one and they’re doing all the talking, they still manage to lay waste to their quadrants of the bowl before I’ve come even close to finishing mine; I can’t get the knack of rolling the rice into a small sort of football, the way they do; squeezing the rice like you might squeeze your thumb.</p>\n<p>I’m making a mess.</p>\n<p>When I’ve finally finished it all - an enormous amount - Fatima goes into the kitchen, comes back, and completely re-fills my section.</p>\n<p><em>It’s too much.</em> It's all too much...</p>\n<p>These beautiful people.</p>\n<p>I love them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fatima’s a stunning girl.</p>\n<p><em>Stunning.</em></p>\n<p>Tall and thin, with a huge smile that never leaves her face.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for her, she can't hold a candle to Fatu.</p>\n<p>Fatu is an utter <em>bombshell.</em></p>\n<p>One of the most beautiful people I’ve ever seen with my own two eyes.</p>\n<p>Easily...</p>\n<p>She’s short and thin but with curves that are an outrage.</p>\n<p>An <em>outrage.</em></p>\n<p>It's an hourglass on steroids. Almost cartoonish. Wearing the figure hugging dresses that look like they've been painted on, she's been driving me insane for weeks.</p>\n<p>Which I feel <em>awful</em> about.</p>\n<p>The trouble I’m having is that despite having the body of a woman, her shortness and her baby-face and her childish manner have me not being able to place her age.</p>\n<p><em>At least not confidently.</em></p>\n<p>And that's a problem...</p>\n<p>If I had to guess I’d say she was maybe early twenties, <em>maximum.</em></p>\n<p>She could <em>definitely</em> be late teens - which makes me a fucking creep.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t surprise me if she was seventeen... It really wouldn't. But it’s impossible to tell, one way or the other.</p>\n<p>I decide to assume she’s a child and go with it like that. Play it safe.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The feast lasts me to Monday. The money transfer comes through, no dramas. <em>I’m flush again.</em></p>\n<p>Ben gets back on <em>Wednesday.</em></p>\n<p>He looks pale and pasty and sick; he mustn’t have seen sunlight for the whole week... He still has that uncharacteristic cheesy/crazy grin on his face.</p>\n<p>Hat’s off to him...</p>\n<p>Lunch with the girls has becoming a daily thing now, and it’s been <em>wonderful.</em></p>\n<p>Just bloody wonderful.</p>\n<p>They’re the kindest people...</p>\n<p>I’m glad I was robbed. It's the best thing that could've happened.</p>\n<p><em>I love this.</em></p>\n<p>This is what it's all about.</p>\n","<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>It's all turned to shit.</p>\n<p>Literally... <em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>On a normal afternoon four days ago I felt a bit weird, just <em>off</em>. So I decided to take a little nap...</p>\n<p>From then till now I've been spraying it out both ends.</p>\n<p>Non-stop.</p>\n<p>Four days and four night of a lurching gut, and either staring at the ceiling of our room, or walking to and from the toilet with hurried steps.</p>\n<p>My relationship with my farts has degenerated into one of strained distrust.</p>\n<p><em>What a life...</em></p>\n<p>My stomach, despite never having anything in it, is massively <em>distended.</em> I look like one of those malnourished kids with the huge bellies you see on charity ads. Horrendously bloated.</p>\n<p>I burp a lot. Three-second-long burps. It tastes like citrus and omelettes. <em>Tangy egg.</em> I'll be fucked if I know why... but it's fucking disgusting.</p>\n<p>The timing could be worse, I guess. I’ve got nowhere to be but here.</p>\n<p>Ben’s back from round two with Asse, and he’s even paler than before. He’s almost translucent and looks almost crook as I do. He's probably fucked off as much bodyweight as I've shat and vomited from the looks of things...</p>\n<p>I reckon I might even look healthier than he does...</p>\n<p>Kid needs some vitamin D and a sandwich.</p>\n<p>I’m still joining the girls for lunch, but it's like I'm renting the food rather than buying it...</p>\n<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>\n<p>Not that I care; I gotta eat something, and I love spending time with them.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to decide whether it’s these lunches that have made me crook, or 'playing chicken' with the local tap water, or just bad luck.</p>\n<p>In any case it’s a good chance to train up an iron-gut for the rest of the journey, and learn some more French.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to look at the bright side...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It comes out at one of our lunches...</p>\n<p><em>I can't believe it.</em></p>\n<p>Fatima is at university, studying medicine. Fatu the bombshell is betrothed to a guy she’s never met, back at her village in the countryside. I find both to be odd because they’re both too young for that...</p>\n<p>&quot;Combee-en des anais ah voo?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>They’re both 25...</em></p>\n<p>I'm 26.</p>\n<p>It’s weird, but even now that I know that they're my age, I can't think of them in any other way.</p>\n<p>They've become more like sisters.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>It's time to call it a day on Dakar.</em></p>\n<p>I've kicked the bug, the credit card has arrived, and there's no reason left to stay. Plus, I’ve been given my marching orders; the Douanes have had enough of me getting extension after extension on the LP, and have given me five days to take my bike out the country. Or else...</p>\n<p><em>Gotta go.</em></p>\n<p>Despite having a tonne of reasons to hate Dakar, I just can’t. It's taken so much, but given back with interest. Like <em>Stockholm Syndrome,</em> I’ve fallen in love with my captor, and I’m sad to leave.</p>\n<p>Ben’s not done riding Asse's gravy train just yet, so he decides to stay in Dakar with his sugar mamma, and see how long he can live the traveller’s dream.</p>\n<p>I'm happy with that result; the time’s been up on our partnership for a while now.</p>\n<p><em>I reckon I can do it alone...</em></p>\n<p>It’s time to lose the training wheels...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Proof of the pudding is in the leaving.</p>\n<p>Even after months of living in each other’s pockets, the goodbye with Ben is pretty unemotional. A shake of the hands and a 'good luck'.</p>\n<p>It's the opposite with the girls.</p>\n<p>We've only spent a few weeks together - and in different languages at that - and yet I feel a true sadness.</p>\n<p>There's a real feeling of severing a connection.</p>\n<p>I know that I'll never see them again.</p>\n<p><em>I don't want to do it.</em></p>\n<p>I want to take them all with me.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if I'm making this up in my head. Symptoms of being stuck in one room too long...</p>\n<p>I'm packed up. Ready to go. I just need to say goodbye...</p>\n<p><em>Fatu has a breakdown.</em></p>\n<p>I have to hold her till she finally stops crying.</p>\n<p>Breaks my fucking heart...</p>\n<p>Fatma starts to bawl...</p>\n<p>Now <em>everyone's</em> crying...</p>\n<p><em>It feels like a wake.</em></p>\n<p>It’s the worst thing, about all of this; anyone I meet, any connection I make, <em>it's all temporary</em>.</p>\n<p>They all have a little expiry date.</p>\n<p>I lose five friends, but I go back to an old one.</p>\n<p><em>The Enfield.</em></p>\n<p>We're alone again.</p>\n<p>For the first time in Africa...</p>\n","<p><em>The Gambia.</em></p>\n<p>The only country I know that's officially got a 'The' in its name.</p>\n<p>The road south to the border is as uneventful as the border crossing itself.</p>\n<p>It's so lax that I thought it was just a beefed up, very busy checkpoint, I nearly rode straight through it...</p>\n<p>When I say 'very busy', I mean fucking <em>packed.</em> As packed with people as the streets are after a big football match.</p>\n<p><em>Teeming.</em></p>\n<p>Despite this, getting through the border posts is a piece of cake.</p>\n<p>I’m learning...</p>\n<p>To get <em>out</em> of a country all you need to do is get the 'exit stamp'. <em>That's it...</em> The Senegalese Douanes gave me a “what the fuck do you want me to do with this?” look when I handed them my LP...</p>\n<p>Getting into The Gambia is a breeze. Visa at the border and a 'temporary import permit' (T.I.P.) with very few questions asked.</p>\n<p>Job done.</p>\n<p>On the way out of the post the Enfield's speedo cable snaps.</p>\n<p>The clock stops at 17,898.6km</p>\n<p>And the speedo is stuck on zero...</p>\n<p>Who's counting anyway?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Gambia is tiny; the smallest country in mainland Africa; it’s only fifty clicks wide at the widest point.

And the river's bloody <em>huge.</em></p>\n<p>The only way from one side to the other is on a ferry. No bridges.</p>\n<p>I buy a one dollar ticket for me and the bike (I <em>love</em> how cheap that is) and head to the front of the line.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Hours...</em></p>\n<p>There's nothing to do but sit side-saddle on the bike and talk to anyone who wants to talk to me.</p>\n<p>And that's quite a few people...</p>\n<p>The local tongue here in The Gambia is, allegedly, English.</p>\n<p><em>I’m not so sure...</em></p>\n<p>I’m struggling to pick up anything anyone says. It's a little embarrassing.</p>\n<p>When I do pick up enough of it, it sounds to me like a bastardised, pidgin version of English.</p>\n<p>It’s kinda like how news reports from Africa have to come with subtitles...</p>\n<p>For what it's worth, I reckon the feeling is mutual; I'll say something in the King's English and the locals will look at me like I just farted...</p>\n<p>I'm already sick of the embarrassment when I have to ask someone to repeat what they just said <em>for the third time</em>, and still have no clue...</p>\n<p>I just end up making up a reaction that <em>seems</em> appropriate to try to save face. <em>It never works.</em> I'm probably laughing when I should be frowning, or shaking my head when I should be smiling...</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>embarrassing.</em></p>\n<p>I'm sure that lesser misunderstandings have left some people in deeper shit...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Finally,</em> someone who talks my language...</p>\n<p>Tall, talkative, middle-aged guy from Liberia.</p>\n<p>Not Libya, <em>Liberia</em>.</p>\n<p>We talk about everything and nothing for a few hours.</p>\n<p>Eventually we get onto <em>the war.</em> It was inevitable...</p>\n<p>I actually know a little bit about the war in Liberia. A couple of decades ago they were all massacring each other. Crimes-against-humanity type shit. Killing babies. Eating their still-warm hearts. <em>Awful</em> shit.</p>\n<p>This guy's ok, all things considered. <em>Well adjusted,</em> even. An earnest type, and maybe on the faintly aggressive side of earnest, but that's fine.</p>\n<p>He tells me that <em>he</em> fought in the war.</p>\n<p>Wasn't expecting that...</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, bullets cannot enter this body.” <em>Right...</em></p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Really??</em> Wow... That's... <em>Impressive.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p>\n<p>I want to tell him that that’s a load of shit... I really, really, <em>really</em> want to tell him. <em>Challenge him.</em> It'd be so easy. But unwise; he's gone from well-adjusted to unhinged in one sentence.</p>\n<p>&quot;You're very lucky.&quot;</p>\n<p>Realising that he has a captive audience, he goes further...</p>\n<p><em>He pulls out a knife...</em></p>\n<p>&quot;If you use this on me, I cannot bleed. Understand??&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah...! Whoa. Yeah right... Got it...&quot; <em>Fuck!</em></p>\n<p>&quot;My skin will break the knife!&quot;</p>\n<p>He's trying to hand me the fucking knife.</p>\n<p>&quot;No, no, nah mate, really mate... <em>nah...</em> nah mate, I believe you.

I believe you.&quot;</p>\n<p>The dumbfuck part of me is <em>dying</em> to take the knife and give him a pinprick on the thumb, see what his reaction is.</p>\n<p>Nooooo... <em>No.</em> Shake it off...</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. Good. My son; he has the juju too.&quot;</p>\n<p>Juju, I think, means your sort of 'level' in black magic. Good juju, bad juju, sort of thing.</p>\n<p>&quot;Lucky him.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. The doctors, they try to immunise him, his skin, it bends back the needles&quot; He shows me with his finger curling in the crook of his elbow how it works. &quot;<em>Nothing</em> can enter his body.&quot;</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s just a plain lie.”</p>\n<p>...is right on the edge of the tip of my tongue.</p>\n<p>My last words... The rest of the bullshit I’m happy to go along with; he’s obviously never tested his theory on himself with knives and bullets – it would have been a messy test – but now he’s obviously just feeding me shit, and we both know it isn’t true.</p>\n<p>I nod. &quot;It’s a very handy thing to have, this 'juju'.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. Later, I will show you the mother of my son.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ok... I'd like to meet her. Sure...&quot;</p>\n<p>I change the topic as we take a walk around the crowd. I don't really want to be near this guy anymore...</p>\n<p>&quot;This is my cousin.&quot; he says, pointing out a young woman.</p>\n<p>&quot;Hi, nice to meet you.&quot; I turn to my new buddy, whose name I've forgotten. &quot;I thought you were going to introduce me to your wife...&quot;</p>\n<p>They both look at me dumbly.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is my wife...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh ok, I'm sorry, I must've got that mixed up... I thought you said <em>cousin!</em> Ha!&quot;</p>\n<p>No one else laughs...</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. She <em>is</em> my cousin. My uncle gave her to me.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>This shit's fucked up.</em></p>\n<p>I've put my fucking foot right in it now... I've <em>definitely</em> offended them. I don't know what to say...</p>\n<p>&quot;I have, cousins...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. My other wife, my father gave her to me.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Fuuuuuck.</em></p>\n<p>Get me out of here...</p>\n<p>Along comes his invulnerable, needle-bending, toddler son.</p>\n<p>I’m looking at his hands and toes to see if there are any extra digits...</p>\n<p>I go to detach myself from the conversation and get back to the Enfield, but, in the parting, he asks me for my phone number...</p>\n<p>&quot;Sorry mate, I don't actually have a phone.&quot; At least that's the truth.</p>\n<p>He gives me his phone number and tells me to call him when I’m on the other side of the river and we’ll catch up for a beer.</p>\n<p>Looks like I’ve made a friend.</p>\n<p>Note to self: <em>Avoid Liberia.</em></p>\n<p>I go sit on the bike. The sun sets, it gets dark, and the ferry finally arrives. I pray that I don't see my new 'friend' again. Not in the dark...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Gambia sucks.</p>\n<p>Don’t come here.</p>\n<p>I can't believe it's a 'tourist destination'.</p>\n<p>Word on the street is that old fat fuck Europeans of both the male and female variety come to the country for a bit of the hot local action.</p>\n<p><em>Gross.</em></p>\n<p>The Gambians market themselves - and are very proud of - their countries unofficial title as 'the smiling coast of Africa'. <em>They talk about it all the time.</em></p>\n<p><em>It’s a complete load of shit,</em> unless they mean it in the sense of 'never smile at a crocodile...'</p>\n<p><em>Jackals everywhere.</em></p>\n<p>Just like Morocco.</p>\n<p>That sucked too.</p>\n<p>This place is even <em>worse.</em></p>\n<p>I had one dickhead follow me around for over an hour through the labyrinth of a local market, trying to 'help me'.</p>\n<p>I'd told him, many times, in no uncertain terms, that I wasn’t interested, till, finally, I snapped.</p>\n<p>“Could you just please fuck off?? <em>Please??</em>”</p>\n<p>&quot;Hey! It's nice to be nice...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, well, <em>fuck off.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>He <em>still</em> wouldn't leave me alone.</p>\n<p>It turned what should have been an interesting, colourful jaunt through the massive, dingy and fantastic local markets into a pain in the arse.</p>\n<p><em>Ruined.</em></p>\n<p>And then the bastard had the audacity to ask for money after following me all the way back to my hotel...</p>\n<p>The last few days have left a tacky, bad taste in my mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>My 'repaired' speedo cable breaks immediately.</p>\n<p>I spent a whole fucking day on that thing... Looks like I won't be knowing anything about my speed or distance for a while.</p>\n<p><em>Piece of shit.</em></p>\n<p>I'm outta here...</p>\n<p>I take the coastal route. Which, whilst incredibly close to the coast, is just far away enough to afford me exactly <em>zero</em> views of the ocean.</p>\n<p>Spewin.</p>\n<p>It's a short and boring ride to the border.</p>\n<p>There's none of the hustle and bustle here of the border I came in on; it's <em>empty...</em></p>\n<p>There's a river, and I don't see a bridge...</p>\n<p>Before I 'stamp out' of The Gambia I get assurances from the border guards that there's a way to get across the river with the bike.</p>\n<p>They stamp my passport with no fuss, and tell me to head down to the shore and talk to 'the man'.</p>\n<p>The river is about as wide across as I could kick a football if I got a run at it.</p>\n<p>The water’s moving fast enough that I can see the direction it’s flowing in, and there's a strong wind whipping up some rippley waves.</p>\n<p>I’m looking around for 'the man'. I’m still a bit concerned - there’s no barge to be seen out on the water. Or nothing of that nature anyway...</p>\n<p>There <em>is</em> a 'pirogue', which is a big, colourful, wooden fishing boat sort of thing. They remind me a bit of the boats that asylum seekers use to get around in. The one I'm eyeing off is bigger than I am tall.</p>\n<p>It doesn't look promising though... The pirogue is beached up on the shore. I’m wondering how we’re going to a) get the boat in the water and b) lift the bike in over the gunnels to get it inside.</p>\n<p>There's a big mob of blokes loitering around not far away from the boat. I reckon I might be able to enlist their help.</p>\n<p>We'll have to have a crack at it anyway... What else is there to do?</p>\n<p>One of the mob comes over and tells me that 'the man' has gone to get the boat and that he’ll be back soon.</p>\n<p>Good.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later a man with a wooden paddle in a hollowed out <em>tree</em> soundlessly appear around the bend.</p>\n<p>I look back over to the mob. My mate, he points, nods his head.</p>\n<p>Thumbs up...</p>\n<p>It's 'the man'.</p>\n<p>I’m a bit confused, but then I realise that this must be the 'tender boat' that they use to go and get the anchored boat. Save themselves from swimming.</p>\n<p><em>Makes sense.</em></p>\n<p>'The man' gently steers over in my direction, and quietly pulls up to my feet on the shore.</p>\n<p>We stare at each other in silence for a long moment.</p>\n<p><em>What??</em></p>\n<p>Nah. Fuck off!</p>\n<p>This is a joke.</p>\n<p>I break off the staring contest and look around at the mob of blokes who have walked over. They all look serious.</p>\n<p>I eventually find my voice. &quot;<em>This</em> is the boat??&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;This??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Really&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But...

Common sense says no. I don't know why no one else can see that...</p>\n<p>I point at the big pirogue.</p>\n<p>“How about that thing?”</p>\n<p>Everyone laughs. So <em>now</em> it's a fucking joke...</p>\n<p>The man shakes his head, &quot;No. No good.&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, I’m fucked then.</p>\n<p>It's nothing more than a hollowed out tree, masquerading as a canoe. It looks like it's been hewn out of a tree that I could hug... It's only about half an inch thick...</p>\n<p>It’s the shit you see poor people paddling down the Amazon on in documentaries.</p>\n<p>The top edge of 'the boat' is only about six inches above the waterline...</p>\n<p>If you gave me a paper, pen and measuring tape I’d be half a chance to do some math and tell you if this is going to work out or not...</p>\n<p>My gut instinct knows it already: <em>fuck no.</em></p>\n<p>The mob assure me, quite calmly, that they’ve done this all before. Heaps of times.</p>\n<p><em>Pigs arse.</em></p>\n<p>Righto... <em>Fuck it.</em></p>\n<p>What else am I going to do??</p>\n<p>&quot;Alright. Ok...&quot;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Me and three of the mob lift the bike onto the canoe as it is. We prop the bike up so it doesn't fall over with some chocks of wood wedged against the sides of the canoe.</p>\n<p>If one of the chocks comes loose, well, there goes the Enfield.</p>\n<p><em>Splash.</em></p>\n<p>The boat sinks down deeper into the water as it takes the weight. Then sinks a little deeper still to fit me in.</p>\n<p>There’s fuck all between the top edge of the canoe and the waterline, a couple of inches. It won’t take much for the whole thing to get swamped and go the way of the Titanic.</p>\n<p>'The man' gingerly gets in...</p>\n<p><em>There's nothing in it.</em></p>\n<p>My heart is smashing. The whole scene seems absurd.</p>\n<p>The bike looks utterly <em>ridiculous</em> perched there at the front. It's like it's not in the boat, but <em>on</em> the boat.</p>\n<p>I can <em>feel</em> the instability, how it rolls when I shift my weight slightly...</p>\n<p>How the fuck am I supposed to fish my bike off the bottom of a river?</p>\n<p>Fuck... Can <em>I</em> even swim in a leather jacket and jeans and boots??</p>\n<p>'The man' very, <em>very</em> gently pushes us off.</p>\n<p><em>Sweet baby Cheeses.</em></p>\n<p>Very gingerly, silently, he dabs his wooden oar in the water and paddles the boat forward against the current.</p>\n<p>Under my breath, I swear every word I know in a string...</p>\n<p>The ripples are spilling over the sides and onto my boots...</p>\n<p>Time beads itself out into a short infinity.</p>\n<p>I can <em>feel</em> my heartbeat move my <em>ears</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Pure fear.</em></p>\n<p>I don't dare move an inch. I grip the boat with white knuckles.</p>\n<p>All is silent but for the ripples, the wind, and the dab of the oar.</p>\n<p>We cross halfway...</p>\n<p>At least it feels like half-way. I dare not turn my head to look back and check.</p>\n<p><em>I think we're going to make it... If we made it this far...</em></p>\n<p>We're <em>actually</em> going to make it...</p>\n<p>I start to crack a smile as we inch closer and closer.</p>\n<p>The ripples come off as we get into the lee of the other shore.</p>\n<p>And then we’re there.</p>\n<p>I set foot, once again, in Senegal, and dance a screaming jig.</p>\n<p><em>Never in doubt!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>There's no Senegalese post here, so I've had to backtrack to the main border crossing to get my passport tamponed.</p>\n<p>The bastards at the Douanes won't give me a laissez-passer without a carnet - unless I pay them 50,000 CFA, roughly $110.</p>\n<p>That's not going to happen...</p>\n<p>I take a temporary 'transit' instead, which only lasts 48 hours.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I head straight to the Douanes at the next town, Ziguinchor, and tell them there's been a mistake; they accidentally gave me a 'transit' instead of an LP at the border.

My Portuguese isn’t quite good enough for “Excuse me, captain, where is the best place on your boat to take a <em>furious</em> shit?”</p>\n<p>I know <em>just</em> the charade though...</p>\n<p><em>Three words...</em> I rub my stomach with one hand and give a cutting motion across my neck with the other.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuuuuuuuck I can't hold it!!</em> I bounce from foot to foot. I can feel my face <em>shaking</em> with the effort.</p>\n<p>The captain looks at me with sympathy, puts his hand to his mouth and flicks his five fingers out with his eyebrows raised - Seasick?</p>\n<p>Shake of the head – <em>No.</em></p>\n<p>I make the same flicking motion, but at the opposite end. <em>The back end.</em></p>\n<p>His eyes go wide and his mouth goes slack.</p>\n<p>I think he’s solved it...</p>\n<p>He shakes his head vigorously and does the flicking motion again out of his mouth, nodding. I think he hopes something’s been lost in translation...</p>\n<p>I furiously shake my head and repeat the same gesture out the back. <em>This won't wait!!</em></p>\n<p>He looks at me with a scrunched up face, like he just smelled something awful. He looks at his mates and then back to me.</p>\n<p>Half of them are returning his expression of horror, the other half are smiling, enjoying the entertainment.</p>\n<p>I quickly steal a glimpse over my shoulder to make sure none of the other passengers are watching this...</p>\n<p>I see two hundred eyes all looking straight back at me.</p>\n<p>Half in horror, half entertained.</p>\n<p><em>The whole fucking boat.</em></p>\n<p>JB's smiling wider than anyone. He's got his camera out.</p>\n<p>&quot;May I?&quot; he shouts over the sound of the motor.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'll fucking kill you, <em>JB</em>! Don't fucking dare mate, nah, <em>I mean it. Fuckin don't!</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>Back to the captain. He points at the island and shrugs his shoulders, eyebrows raised – <em>can’t it wait?</em></p>\n<p>I shake my head, and point at the floor – nope, <em>right here, right now.</em></p>\n<p>The closer I get to having it done with the more my brain thinks that it's time to open the floodgates...</p>\n<p><em>I’m losing control!</em> Sweat drips off my face.</p>\n<p>The Captain pats me on the shoulder and points me to the back of the boat.</p>\n<p>It's just a plank of wood, then the ocean...</p>\n<p>Times up; all the charades are going to count for nothing.</p>\n<p>I lunge at the plank, dak myself, hang my arse over the back - not a second too soon...</p>\n<p><em>Fire in the hole!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This plank of wood is now mine... I just owned it...</p>\n<p>Non-stop, for <em>minutes.</em></p>\n<p>This is the most outlandish thing I've <em>ever</em> done. Hands down. And in front of a crowd of hundreds to boot...</p>\n<p>I've never, <em>ever</em> shat in front of <em>anyone</em> in my life...</p>\n<p>Yet all I feel is <em>relief.</em></p>\n<p>Release from hours of torment.</p>\n<p>I enjoy the moment; this is as bad as it gets, and I'll never see any of these people again for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Except JB...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Bubaque Island</em></p>\n<p>JB’s half-cut on boxed wine by the time we get into the 'port.'</p>\n<p><em>He's had a great time...</em></p>\n<p>We walk about two or three clicks away from the 'village' to the western side of the island, find a stretch of beach, and shack up in the dusk.</p>\n<p>It looked like the incident on the boat was going to be a one hit wonder, nevertheless I was a bit toey during dinner and the walk back to camp...</p>\n<p>After what has been a pretty grubby day - not to mention the heat and humidity - I'm feeling the need to wash off.</p>\n<p>The only option is the ocean.</p>\n<p>The beach is less of a beach and more of a tidal plain; The sand has a muddy texture to it, and for a few hundred meters off the 'shore' the water never gets deeper than waist height. For me, it just feels creepy. I'm waiting to step on something unpleasant...</p>\n<p>Apparently, the islands are <em>packed</em> with little stingrays.</p>\n<p>Despite being completely creeped out, and in nothing but the moonlight, I try to get as deep as I can; <em>I really need this.</em></p>\n<p>I dive in, keeping my head out of the water.</p>\n<p>All around me lights up in an electric blue flash.</p>\n<p><em>Panic.</em></p>\n<p>Something's <em>attacking</em> me.</p>\n<p>I thrash wildly, but that makes it worse.</p>\n<p>When I realise I’m not dying, and not in any pain, I stop moving. All the light stops. Like flicking a switch...</p>\n<p>Back to black.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;What the fuck??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I scoop my hand through the dark water and nothing happens.</p>\n<p>I do it faster, and my hand leaves a trail of bright blue light in its wake.</p>\n<p>Like tiny fireflies. Tiny, miniscule, electric blue, water-fireflies.</p>\n<p><em>I think it’s going to be ok;</em> I don’t think they’re attacking me...</p>\n<p>I get brave, and go swimming.</p>\n<p>It’s like being lit up in a tesla coil, they're sparking all over my body.</p>\n<p><em>Like a fucking wizard.</em></p>\n<p>Before long I’m carrying on like a kid in snow for the first time.</p>\n<p>I’m making electric blue water angels.</p>\n<p>I'm laughing like a crazy-man.</p>\n<p><em>This is too good not to share...</em></p>\n<p>I yell at JB to get out here. Naturally, he thinks I’ve gone insane, he doesn't even want to get out of his tent.</p>\n<p>I <em>insist.</em> He wants to know what's going on, but I won't tell him.</p>\n<p>I have to actually get out of the water, and go dripping wet up to his tent to coax him out. Grinning like an idiot.</p>\n<p>It’s a whole other mission to get him <em>into</em> the water without explaining why.</p>\n<p>Once he realises what’s going on, he’s as disbelieving as I am.</p>\n<p>The two of us go <em>berserk.</em> Two big blue trails following us around and lighting up in the dark.</p>\n<p>It's the most wondrous experience I've ever had.</p>\n<p><em>What a day...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>I didn't shit myself on the boat ride home.</em></p>\n<p>We want to spend one extra day in Bissau. It's unanimous; we really like it here.</p>\n<p>I spend the day in the markets just being a part of the madness. Fresh produce, closely mingled with the fly covered butchers. Chop shops (for cooked food). Pharmacy. Koran korner. Auto. Knick-nacks. Each has their own un-official area.</p>\n<p>Other than a few people dropping in 'branco', I'm mostly just getting confused looks from the locals, like they don't understand why I'm here. They leave me to my smiling self.</p>\n<p>In spite of the incident on the boat I’ve become even braver with my food choices. After all, it can't get any worse.</p>\n<p>I’m actively seeking out the local food, no matter how dodgy it looks.</p>\n<p>The food places that the locals eat at are easy to spot. Sometimes they are houses and shacks; so-called 'restaurants'. But, most of the time, the place to eat is just a wooden bench and a table set up on a street corner. The table will be covered with steel pots. The biggest pot - which is usually an enormous bucket the size of a laundry basket - will be filled with steaming rice, and the rest are all filled with 'sauces'. You can take your pick.</p>\n<p>I always have what everyone else is having. Safest bet.</p>\n<p>The 'big mamma' will fill up a colourful plastic bowl with rice for you, cover it in your pick of the sauces, and hand you a spoon from out of the dirty brown wash bucket on the floor that someone before you has just used.</p>\n<p>Give that a wipe with your shirt, if your shirt's not filthy...</p>\n<p>The sauces are invariably of a greenish-brownish colour, with a layer of brown oil that rises and sits on the top.</p>\n<p>The texture is that of slime.</p>\n<p>You can add as much chilli and crushed up seasoning cubes as you like.</p>\n<p>The whole shebang will cost you under a dollar.</p>\n<p>It’s customary to ask the big mamma for another ladleful of slimy sauce when your half way through; everyone does it, don't be shy - just hand her your bowl. No extra cost.</p>\n<p><em>It’s fucking delicious.</em></p>\n<p>I swear that they’re sprinkling opium into it or something. It’s outrageously moreish. It demands to be eaten till you burst. <em>I can’t get enough.</em></p>\n<p>Once you get over the fact that this obviously isn’t the height of hygiene - and it’s a bit of a crapshoot when it comes to getting crook (pardon the pun) - you can really start to enjoy it for how <em>good</em> it is.</p>\n<p>As well as being cheap and plentiful and tasty-as-fuck, it also has the added benefits of living out the 'when in Rome' ideal. It's the <em>real McCoy.</em></p>\n<p>I can tell that the locals are proud of the fact that I'm sharing lunch with them.</p>\n<p>They're always full of smiles, and eager for conversation.</p>\n<p>First question, in any language, is always the equivalent of “you like this food??”</p>\n<p>Smiles all round. Me, biggest of all.</p>\n<p>&quot;I <em>love</em> this food.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cue laughing from the whole bench.</p>\n<p>I do love this...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Today, the love of my life got married.</p>\n<p>Could've been me.</p>\n<p><em>Nearly was me.</em></p>\n<p>Probably <em>should</em> have been me.</p>\n<p>And then none of this would have happened...</p>\n<p>I don't know how I feel about it.</p>\n<p>Lucky...</p>\n<p>But that doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem <em>right.</em></p>\n<p>But I do feel like I'm living the best life in the world; I wouldn't trade places with anyone, <em>anyone</em>. Not for quids.</p>\n<p>How many can say that?</p>\n","<p>Guinea.</p>\n<p><em>Guinea</em>, Guinea.</p>\n<p>I wanted to go in a straight line: A to B</p>\n<p>JB wanted: A C E D F G to B.</p>\n<p>Different styles...</p>\n<p>We took the 'lowest common denominator of adventure' and went with the route he wanted: Inland.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for JB, it wasn’t all that adventurous. While I was revelling in some nice weather and good quality tarmac, JB called it “boring as bat shit”; the kid gets the shakes if he goes too long without dirt n dust.</p>\n<p>Guinea-Bissau is pretty flat and sparsely greened, so there’s not a whole lot to do other than just chew the miles and let your head free-wheel.</p>\n<p>After a couple of days of riding we get to a pretty obscure border post. I'm not even sure if this place has a name...</p>\n<p><em>Looks like a goat track.</em></p>\n<p>Getting out of Guinea-Bissau is pretty uneventful.</p>\n<p>Usual stuff.</p>\n<p>While I'm waiting for JB to get his carnet stamped out, I figured I'd do some bits and pieces around the bike. Just tyre kicking sort of stuff. I give the front tyre a really good squeeze to check the air pressure.</p>\n<p><em>Pop!</em></p>\n<p>Dislocated thumb.</p>\n<p>It pops right back in...</p>\n<p><em>Awesome...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The road between the border posts is a few kilometres of rock hop. It’s pretty standard practice that countries don’t want to spend a dime on the roads between borders. Why would they?</p>\n<p>The Guinea side of the border is manned by two guys. We seem to be interrupting someone's lunch...</p>\n<p>No one else is here.</p>\n<p>For small talk, I ask them what the connection is between 'the two Guineas', as in, why the same name? They look at me like I'm retarded and just farted. No reply...</p>\n<p>Righto...</p>\n<p>We get our passports tamponed easily enough, and I end up getting offered a free LP for the bike, which doesn’t seem standard practice.</p>\n<p>I’m absolutely <em>thrilled</em> with that; it’s the first time that I’ve ever spent <em>nix</em> for a whole border crossing.</p>\n<p>Of course, I give JB the shits, &quot;Hey, JB, remind me, how much did you spent on that carnet? How much mate..? Thousands, right? What a shame! My god! <em>Thousands!!</em> Such a waste!&quot;</p>\n<p>Winging it: 1</p>\n<p>Carnet: 0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Guinea makes an immediate impression; gone are the dry flats, replaced by big, sheer faced cliffs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_27.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After the flatness of Guinea-Bissau, it’s great to have some variety.</p>\n<p>The road turns from a goat track to some really nicely levelled red-dirt roads. We nail it. Kicking up big clouds of red dust as we put the hammer down.</p>\n<p>I've come to the conclusion that I’ll take a well levelled, red-dirt track over a shitty, potholed tarmac road. Any day.</p>\n<p>By sunset we pull into a village called Koundara.</p>\n<p>Koundara is in the middle of nowhere, nestled between the inland borders of Guinea, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and Mali. It has the feeling of a small, isolated village that has become a little bit overgrown.</p>\n<p>Around this time of the day I always get a little nervy and fidgety, wanting to find somewhere to sleep and find it fast before it gets any closer to dark, while JB is happy to go and grab a beer and then worry about those 'details' after.</p>\n<p><em>We clash.</em></p>\n<p>JB's just happy to camp. Why spend the money? I won’t camp unless something’s gone wrong; there’s <em>zero</em> security, and why bother roughing it when a cheap hotel is cheap?</p>\n<p>Plus, it’s been a long, hot, sweaty, grubby day in that leather jacket and jeans. I want <em>at least</em> a bucket and water to 'shower' with.</p>\n<p>We end up finding a compromise when a local restaurant owner invites us to set up camp in the walled off courtyard of his house.</p>\n<p>We’re both happy with that.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>New day.</p>\n<p>New country. New language. New currency.</p>\n<p>There are no cash machines out here, so we exchange some of our CFA over into Guinean Francs.</p>\n<p>We trade only as much as we think we'll need, as there are other countries further south that should use the CFA as well.</p>\n<p>We only need enough to get us through to lunchtime tomorrow, when we'll be in Labe.</p>\n<p>Language: Back to French.</p>\n<p>I've got to admit, charades and Portuguese in Bissau were starting to wear a little thin...</p>\n<p>On the way out of the village JB says that that he wouldn’t mind checking out Mali on the way to Labe.</p>\n<p>&quot;Really? <em>Mali??</em> I don't think we can go to <em>Mali</em> mate, do you have a visa? Shit, it must be a day's ride at least...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Nah, not the country, a village, same name, not far. We can check it out on the way to Labe.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, alright, shit, I thought you meant the <em>country!</em> Why are all the names around here the same?&quot; I have a think about it, &quot;How far is it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;About eighty clicks&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, no worries. You got it on the map?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah the <em>village</em> is marked, but there's no road on the map.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Sooooo...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So a guy told me this morning where the turn-off is.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mmmm, oright then, you've got point.&quot;</p>\n<p>We peel out of Koundara, and take the turn off onto an orange dirt road.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Rough.</em> Things get slow.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>By the end of the morning the track dead ends at a village that's <em>not</em> called Mali.</p>\n<p>We're not even <em>halfway</em> to Mali, let alone Labe...</p>\n<p>The 'distance made good' on the GPS is reading two fifths of fuck all. Looking at our GPS track so far, it looks like we've taken the path of a tortured river.</p>\n<p>We grab lunch in the village, and get pointed out the way to Mali.</p>\n<p>Out of the village and we have to <em>bush bash.</em></p>\n<p>Overgrown goat tracks going in all directions.</p>\n<p>They keep branching and then branching again, and then branching again. Exponential options. It's impossible to know which way is the right way to go; we just keep on the line closest to 'as the crow flies' according to the GPS.</p>\n<p>I'm going as fast as I dare to keep speed with JB.</p>\n<p>But I lose him in the brush. I can't keep pace...</p>\n<p>I get another glimpse of him again as I round a corner.</p>\n<p>But I can't make the next corner to see which track he's taken....</p>\n<p>I guess. Pick one. Then I guess again, and again...</p>\n<p>Lost.</p>\n<p><em>I've lost him.</em></p>\n<p>Freak out.</p>\n<p><em>I pin the throttle.</em></p>\n<p>So far off the grid, it’s obvious that this is more than I can chew.</p>\n<p>And now I’m on my own.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p><em>Adrenaline.</em></p>\n<p>I'm going way, <em>way</em> faster than I have any right to on an Enfield in this shit with my skill level. <em>I just need to get a glimpse of that KTM again...</em></p>\n<p>I’m on the cusp of throwing in the towel and retracing my steps back to the village - if I can - when I spot him again; a <em>flash</em> of colour in the trees.</p>\n<p>I chase him down like a man possessed, I can't believe that I'm actually catching him...</p>\n<p>I pull him over, and he <em>cops</em> it. I tear shreds off him in a freak-out-fuelled rant.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t think it’s a big deal, but agrees to keep me in his mirrors from here on out, or let me lead the way at my snail’s pace.</p>\n<p>I know that I’m cramping his style.</p>\n<p><em>But I don’t give a fuck;</em> I’m way out of my league here and my mind is boggled at the prospect of being stranded solo.</p>\n<p>We agree that this path is fucked; it can't be the one to Mali.</p>\n<p>We've been given a bum steer.</p>\n<p>We head back to the village for clarification.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>True to form, half the mob points us one way, the other half points us the other way.</p>\n<p>I’ve got serious misgivings about this; I’m usually happy winging it, but this is a whole other level of uncertainty and risk. Plus, the day’s half gone, we won’t get anywhere near Labe at this rate...</p>\n<p>I’m happy to cut losses, head back to Koundara, and start again to Labe, tomorrow, <em>on the main road.</em></p>\n<p>JB is still enthusiastic about Mali.</p>\n<p>Alright...</p>\n<p><em>Fuck it...</em></p>\n<p>We pick a direction and just go.</p>\n<p>Not far from the village, we run into a 'bridge', which sounds vaguely familiar from half the directions we’ve been given.</p>\n<p>The 'bridge' is just an arrangement of long wooden sleepers over a creek. Three planks wide, four planks long and held together, somehow, with bicycle chains.</p>\n<p><em>Dubious.</em></p>\n<p>I tell JB he can go first...</p>\n<p>He doesn't hesitate.</p>\n<p>He makes it.</p>\n<p>I make it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_28.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The path heads straight for the mountain in front of us that’s dominating the landscape; all brown with patches of green, it's like it's covered in a giant army camo.</p>\n<p>Seems like we're going to have to go right over it then...</p>\n<p>The path steepens. Becomes rocky.</p>\n<p><em>Very</em> rocky.</p>\n<p>The bounciness starts to test the limits of my suspension.</p>\n<p>Then the rocks get huge.</p>\n<p>Like, baby rhino huge.</p>\n<p>I don't have the clearance for this...</p>\n<p>I could walk this faster than I'm riding it.</p>\n<p>First gear, riding the clutch.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It gets hot as the afternoon stretches out...</p>\n<p>This is technical as hell. It's lock-jaw scary.</p>\n<p>To either lose revs, or to stall on a rock, or lose any forward momentum is to have a crash. And to have a crash is to be potentially fucked.</p>\n<p>JB deals with the terrain by just dropping the clutch and going for it, scrambling all over the place, fast.</p>\n<p><em>I can't do that.</em></p>\n<p>He has the luxury of clearance. His oil sump is a long way from those rocks. Mine is not... I risk smashing it open like cracking an egg...</p>\n<p>Despite my softly-softly approach I’m still bottoming the bike out all the bloody time and bashing the undercarriage on the rocks. The centre stand and exhaust pipe are taking the brunt of the onslaught, thank god.</p>\n<p>All it takes is one bad bounce - crack - and there goes your bike. You’re fucked. You’re <em>done.</em></p>\n<p>Then what? Out here, I don't even know...</p>\n<p>We break. It's <em>reeking</em> hot.</p>\n<p>&quot;Far out how's this??&quot; JB's still enthused. I've got nothing to add... &quot;This is the absolute <em>limit</em> of what I would dare to attempt solo...&quot;</p>\n<p>That's <em>JB</em> saying that...</p>\n<p><em>On a KTM.</em></p>\n<p>JB, who <em>loves</em> this kind of stuff...</p>\n<p>What the fuck am I doing here?? On an Enfield??</p>\n<p>JB checks his temp gauge.</p>\n<p>Forty two degrees. <em>Way over 100.</em></p>\n<p>Fuck. I hope that's wrong. <em>Though it feels right...</em></p>\n<p>I'd kill someone for a breeze... I'm sure the Enfield would too. It's air-cooled. I reckon I could cook an egg on it.</p>\n<p>The bike’s not up for this, I’m not up for this, we don’t even know if we’re on the right fucking path.</p>\n<p>Shit, we’re likely lost...</p>\n<p>Who the hell told us at the start of the day that we could get to Mali? <em>We’ve been stitched.</em> And now we're well too far in to go back. JB wouldn't go back anyway...</p>\n<p>We check the GPS.</p>\n<p>Despite spending the whole day at it, we're not even going to make Mali.</p>\n<p>Fuck, we're not even close...</p>\n<p>We can't break for long, we've got to cover as much distance as we can before dark...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We come across an old lady and a toddler, the only people we’ve seen on the track all afternoon. We stop for a break, and to get directions.</p>\n<p>Turns out that despite all the chances to get lost and fuck this up, we seem to have lucked out and got it right.</p>\n<p>According to the lady, this is 'the path' to Mali.</p>\n<p>Brilliant.</p>\n<p>Then she gets her saggy, flappy tit out.</p>\n<p>I'm not entirely sure what to say to that...</p>\n<p>We let that slide through to the keeper like it didn't happen, and ride on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>More rock hopping...</p>\n<p>A dull thud and scratch as the Enfield bottoms out, <em>again.</em></p>\n<p>The bike loses all power and comes to a complete stop.</p>\n<p><em>The engine dies.</em></p>\n<p>Ohhhhh. <em>WHAT??</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;NO!!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I bend my head and neck over like a panicked ostrich.</p>\n<p>No oil spilling out...</p>\n<p><em>Thank fuck!</em></p>\n<p>What's broken then?</p>\n<p>I turn the key off and on again.</p>\n<p>No fuel pump whining like it always does...</p>\n<p>No ignition when I push the starter. <em>Silence.</em></p>\n<p>Mmmm. Odd... If I've broken something, then all that should still work...</p>\n<p>Electrical then?</p>\n<p>Does that even make sense?? <em>No...</em></p>\n<p>I jump off and get down on all fours to inspect.</p>\n<p>No damage... Except that the centre stand and that exhaust are dinged up real bad, and the kick stand's a bit flappy. I give the kick stand a wiggle, and I hear the fuel pump prime itself.</p>\n<p>Kick stand?? Kill switch??</p>\n<p>I hit the ignition.</p>\n<p>The bike comes to life. Like nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Thank fuck... for that...</p>\n<p>I jump on and go after JB, who, true to form, has disappeared again...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The landscape turns from that washed out dry green and yellow camo to charcoal black.</p>\n<p>There’s been a fire through here.</p>\n<p><em>Recently.</em></p>\n<p>We ride through the scorched earth till we find the line where the burnt meets the living.</p>\n<p>It's a very big, very small fire.</p>\n<p>The flames are only shin height, but they extend in each direction as far as we can see.</p>\n<p>It’s a weird thing to just casually ride on through it...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_29.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My kick stand kill switch finally gives up the ghost. Some quick bush mechanics and it's disconnected.</p>\n<p>This whole afternoon has felt like we’ve been treading water. Working so hard and going nowhere. <em>We're not making Mali.</em> That's obvious. It's time to start thinking of where we're spending the night...</p>\n<p>JB suggests we bush camp.</p>\n<p>I suggest he opens his eyes... I’m not too crash hot on waking up in the middle of the night with a burning tent melting itself onto my face and turning me into something that's been shrink wrapped...</p>\n<p><em>No thanks.</em> We <em>have to</em> find a village.</p>\n<p>I'm out of water. Shit, I've been out of water for hours. I'm dehydrated enough to have the beginnings of a headache and a ripping thirst.</p>\n<p>It's village or bust.</p>\n<p>Things have eased up in terms of technical/difficult, and we can hammer it in the hope of finding something before sundown...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Pure jammy luck.</p>\n<p>We run into a small village of about ten to twenty buildings with variously thatched and tinned roofs. It's called <em>Toumba.</em></p>\n<p>As soon as we kill the bikes, a guy comes up to us. He's wearing a funny hat, sunglasses, and a mean face.</p>\n<p>&quot;Pap-ee-airs&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Papers.</em></p>\n<p>Oh <em>fuck off.</em></p>\n<p>JB and I pretend like we don't understand him.</p>\n<p>So... Where to camp?</p>\n<p>JB wants to camp somewhere outside the village, but I’d be much more comfortable somewhere amongst other people, especially with that bushfire around...</p>\n<p>I ask Monsieur Papier if it’s ok to camp out somewhere in the village.</p>\n<p>Suddenly we’re not strangers, we’re <em>guests.</em></p>\n<p>Papers are forgotten and we’re pointed towards what I can only describe as a gazebo. It's big enough for both tents, with a hard floor and a thatched roof. It's better than anything we could have hoped for.</p>\n<p>School’s out. All the kids of the village - more than you would have expected for a village this size - come sprinting out of class, making a beeline right at us.</p>\n<p>I’m pretty sure that none of these kids have ever seen anything the likes of us before...</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to shake hands. So much so that once they've shaken hands they walk to the back of the mob to line up for the honour again.</p>\n<p>I reckon I've shaken hands with everyone three times over.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We get out cameras, and the kids go <em>psycho.</em></p>\n<p>We thought we were being mobbed before, but now they go totally ape escape.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_31.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Monsieur Papier instructs the kids to clean out our hut for us and they take to it with furious gusto.</p>\n<p>As we set up our tents, we're being watched with rapt attention.</p>\n<p>I make a song and dance of it - like a camping clown - and the kids love it.</p>\n<p>While I'm doing that, JB goes and collects water from the local well, and tries to put it through his never-used water purifier. It seems to be more work than he expected, but in the end we've got a shitload of drinkable water.</p>\n<p>Couldn't have done this without him. Wouldn't have dared.</p>\n<p>Would've probably gotten cholera...</p>\n<p>With the euphoric deadness of someone who's earnt their sleep, I pass out in my tent.</p>\n<p>Best day of the trip?</p>\n<p>Maybe...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I get up in the middle of the night and shit my brains out.</p>\n<p><em>I guess that purifier didn't catch everything...</em></p>\n<p>Despite severe and creative rationing, I use my last square of toilet paper, and there's still work to do...</p>\n<p><em>Great...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Breakfast.</em></p>\n<p>We're told that yesterday’s epic ride was the <em>easy</em> bit.</p>\n<p>I don't believe it.

I can't even imagine what that would look like without needing a rope and tackle...</p>\n<p>Shit... What happens if there’s a bit that we just can’t get past? A bit that’s impossible? Or we get lost again or something?</p>\n<p>This trip to Mali was supposed to be a little morning detour... A <em>jaunt.</em></p>\n<p>We buy some donkey piss petrol in bottles on the way out of the village with almost the last of our money.</p>\n<p>We’re off into the unknown. Again...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Immediately things are tougher; the track is steeper; the rocks are bigger and seem to be arranged in such a way to make passage as difficult as possible.</p>\n<p><em>I can't do that.</em></p>\n<p>JB goes.</p>\n<p>He's standing up on the pegs and guns it, bouncing all over the place, rocks flying everywhere...</p>\n<p>He makes the top.</p>\n<p>I wonder how much of that was skill and how much of that was just luck. I wonder if our luck will run out...</p>\n<p>I thump my way up. Bounce and rev and smash my way to the top, hitting rock after rock, frying my clutch till I join JB.</p>\n<p>White knuckled.</p>\n<p>We're both grinning like maniacs.</p>\n<p><em>This is fucking stupid.</em></p>\n<p>One down...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Mali as the sun sets.</em></p>\n<p>We <em>Shawshanked</em> it.

The reason JB wanted to come out here in the first place.</p>\n<p>It'd better be fucking good...</p>\n<p>Her head's on the currency here. She's a cliff. A big cliff. When you look at her from side-on she looks like a silhouette portrait of a woman.</p>\n<p>It’s like the queen’s head on a coin, but on a mountain. So we're told... <em>We can't find her.</em></p>\n<p>But, the view from up here is fucking <em>spectacular.</em> I sit on my own cliff side, dangling my legs hundreds of meters above the world.</p>\n<p>I chuck a rock over the edge and feel nauseous as it plummets till it's too small to see anymore.</p>\n<p><em>A messy death.</em></p>\n<p>It's just me, alone, on the cliff edge. JB's off somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I leave the camera in my pocket. It could never do this justice, and some things just shouldn't be photographed...</p>\n<p>I sit for as long as the caveman part of my brain will let me (it keeps screaming 'back away from the cliff! IDIOT!!')</p>\n<p>Time to keep searching...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We find the Dame.</p>\n<p><em>I was sitting on her head...</em></p>\n<p>She's so perfect that I have to think it was made by man.

I could tie him down in the mountains, but on this road he's just <em>unleashed the beast.</em></p>\n<p>So much for 'keeping me in the mirrors'.</p>\n<p>I'm flying along too, in my own way. It's good to be finally making progress...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Somethings not right...</em></p>\n<p>What's that <em>sound??</em> Something's <em>off...</em></p>\n<p>I make an inspection of the bike while on the move.</p>\n<p>The front tyre is deflating. <em>Rapidly.</em></p>\n<p><em>Shit...</em></p>\n<p>This'll be interesting... I’ve got the tools, and a spare inner tube, but none of the know-how.</p>\n<p><em>No fucking idea.</em></p>\n<p>Thank god for JB. I'm sure he’s done this a thousand times.</p>\n<p>I pull up, get everything I think we’ll need ready. And wait for him to come.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ok...</p>\n<p>He might take a while to figure out I'm not coming. I'll make a start on the obvious stuff. It’s basically like changing a bicycle tyre, only bigger, right? And I’ve done that a few times when I was a kid. You don't need a <em>degree</em> to do this...</p>\n<p>I’ve got to take the axle out to get the wheel off. Not sure what happens with the brakes when I do that... but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p>\n<p>Off come's the axle nut with my big adjustable spanner.</p>\n<p>I push the axle to slide it out. <em>It won’t budge.</em></p>\n<p>I whack it with the palm of my hand... <em>Nothing.</em></p>\n<p>I can hear my dad’s voice in my head saying 'never force anything'.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck that...</em></p>\n<p>I give the end of the axle a couple of wallops with the spanner.</p>\n<p>Still nothing.</p>\n<p><em>I’ve failed before I’ve even started.</em></p>\n<p>I dig into my bags to get the workshop manual to see what it has to say about it; quite a bit, surprisingly.</p>\n<p>“Remove the axle nut, release the clamp and gently tap out the axle”</p>\n<p><em>Clamp?</em> What clamp?</p>\n<p>Oh, <em>that</em> clamp. Shit. What an idiot.

He’ll know what to do...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>I feel abandoned.</em></p>\n<p>It's getting late...</p>\n<p>Fucking JB...</p>\n<p>Even if I could do the tube change myself, I don’t have an air pump. So I’m buggered.</p>\n<p>Should I walk the ten clicks back to Mali to get help? That'll take a good hour and a half...</p>\n<p>Why hasn’t JB realised that something’s up and come back to check on me?</p>\n<p>While I ponder that, a couple of blokes wearing filthy rags rock up on a scooter.</p>\n<p>They have with them a big set of 'tyre irons', and the equivalent of a football pump.</p>\n<p><em>You ripper.</em></p>\n<p>Without much said between us, they get to it like it’s no biggie.</p>\n<p><em>Routine.</em></p>\n<p>One of them tries pushing the axle. When that doesn’t work, he screws the axle nut back on a few turns and then starts belting the absolute shit out of it with my spanner.</p>\n<p>&quot;Oi!! <em>What the fuck??</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>He doesn’t seem to hear me. After six full blooded smashes with the spanner the axle reluctantly comes out.</p>\n<p>The poor axle nut has been <em>creamed,</em> and comes out of the bashing looking a little warpy. <em>Don't know if that'll work again...</em></p>\n<p>Noted: When it doesn’t work, <em>hit it harder.</em></p>\n<p>Nice job.</p>\n<p>Off comes the wheel and the two blokes go all bush mechanics on the tyre with their tyre irons. 'Tyre irons' are to motorbike tyres what teaspoons are to bicycle tyres; they’re just flat metal sticks that you use to lever the rubber tyre out of the metal rim, so you can get the air tube out.</p>\n<p>My tyre irons are pissy little things that look like oversized popsticks. They came with the bike. These guys have got ones as long as your arms. Tyre irons, that is... I've got tyre iron envy...</p>\n<p>Anyway. Zero shits are given for aesthetics as they <em>have at it;</em> gouging big chunks of rubber out, and scratching the green paint off my rims.</p>\n<p><em>I'm not impressed.</em> But these guys are saving my bacon. Bigtime. Tyre: peeled out.</p>\n<p>Out comes the old tube, in goes the new one.</p>\n<p>The bush mechanics use their feet to stamp the tyre back into the rim.</p>\n<p><em>Noted.</em></p>\n<p>With the tyre back on the rim, the air valve looks badly on the piss; it's at a really weird angle. That means that the tube isn't anywhere near where it should be in the tyre... Not aligned...</p>\n<p>I want to start all over again; properly align it so that it doesn’t give me another flat down the road.</p>\n<p>They just force it straight and lock it with a nut.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck it.</em></p>\n<p>Now’s not the time to be pedantic. <em>It's getting late.</em></p>\n<p>The tyre gets pumped up, the wheel goes back in and everything gets tightened up the way it was.</p>\n<p><em>Legends.</em></p>\n<p>And I did nothing.</p>\n<p>And <em>still</em> no JB.</p>\n<p>Where is that bloke??</p>\n<p>I'm becoming less pissed off and more concerned that he’s found trouble of his own... Maybe he's wondering where the fuck I am... In a ditch somewhere...</p>\n<p>I thank my bush mechanics profusely. One of them makes the international sign for money with his fingers. <em>Fair enough.</em> But I’ve got fuck all. After all that the poor bastards only get the equivalent of a dollar out of me. They're not impressed... I feel like a lousy tight-arse jerk.</p>\n<p>Things are starting to get dim as I take off to find out what happened to JB.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Five minutes down the road, I find him <em>screaming</em> back in my direction.</p>\n<p>Noted: When the shit hits the fan, <em>you're on your own.</em></p>\n<p>I tell JB the facts of the matter through some thinly veiled vitriol.</p>\n<p><em>Moving on.</em></p>\n<p>Labe’s not on the radar anymore, but we still want to get as far along the road as possible before night forces us to stop.</p>\n<p>We take off at an absolute tear.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I round a corner just in time to catch the final moments of JB and another bike in a massive head-on collision.</p>\n<p>Shit flying everywhere.</p>\n<p><em>I pin it.</em></p>\n<p>JB's on the wrong side of the red-road, and has slammed at full tilt into another bike carrying passengers coming the other way. <em>On a clear straight.</em></p>\n<p><em>How the fuck does that even happen???</em></p>\n<p>As I ride up to it there are bodies and bikes laid out everywhere. In the carnage of all of it I’m thinking <em>'Dammit JB, my day’s been tough enough...'</em></p>\n<p><em>Everyone’s ok.</em></p>\n<p>Well, sort of... It's a fucking miracle no one got <em>halved.</em></p>\n<p>No one's dead...</p>\n<p>The two women passengers seem a bit tender... The man riding the bike and JB have come away without a scratch. <em>Buy a lotto ticket.</em></p>\n<p>The blokes bike is a <em>mess;</em> the front fender's been mangled, his tyre’s burst and his headlight’s completely wrecked.</p>\n<p>JB’s beast machine has had the indicator clipped off and nothing else but a few scratches. Built like a brick shithouse, that thing.</p>\n<p>JB's <em>venting his spleen</em> at the other rider.</p>\n<p>From the game of charades, it looks like they did some sort of mad dance, like two people walking toward each other in a hallway, each mirroring the other's evasive action. <em>Collision.</em></p>\n<p>JB's telling him <em>he</em> should have gotten out of the way.</p>\n<p><em>Has he gone effing nuts?</em> JB was on the wrong side of the bloody road for Christ’s sakes! Who else could <em>possibly</em> be at fault? How is it that he’s not apologising profusely??</p>\n<p>I cut JB off and tell him to pull his fucking head in before it gets knocked off.</p>\n<p><em>I don't want to be lynched in Guinea...</em> Somehow - even out here - we're drawing a crowd...</p>\n<p>Now is not the time to be 'casting the first stone'.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to get to work.</p>\n<p>I pull my punctured tube out of my bags and JB goes to work re-patching it and replacing it in the other bike.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I bandage up the two poor old ladies, who seem to have sprained their wrists in the fall.</p>\n<p>It's interesting that the order went: 1) bikes 2) the old ladies.</p>\n<p>Everybody's coming up to me saying that <em>I</em> need to pay. I tell them to go and talk to JB...</p>\n<p>JB bodges through the tube repair and I bodge through the first aid. It looks like it's going to be two placebos of uselessness, but everyone seems to be feeling better.</p>\n<p>Money exchanges hands - about ten dollars worth - and everyone is now suddenly happy again. <em>No hard feelings.</em></p>\n<p>By the time we get away from the crash-site it’s twilight.</p>\n<p>That’s another first.</p>\n<p>I’m always, <em>always</em> off the bike by now.</p>\n<p>And it’s a shame, because this is beautiful...</p>\n<p>The breeze is cool and crisp on my face, the colours have taken on a richness and depth that they’ve never had before. The world around us seems to take on a calm stillness...</p>\n<p>Despite the madness and stress of the afternoon I’m still grinning from ear to ear in my helmet.</p>\n<p><em>What a day.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_34.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Twilight quickly turns to darkness, turns to pitch.</p>\n<p>We have to pull off the road and set up a wild camp, in the middle of nowhere in the middle of Guinea in the middle of West Africa.</p>\n<p>While I’m still mucking around with tent poles in the light of the full moon, JB's already set-up, so he jumps on his bike and goes in search of dinner/breakfast.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later he comes back with stale bread and a packet of biscuits.</p>\n<p>&quot;Which is dinner, and which is breakfast??&quot;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Labe.</em></p>\n<p>I take out all of the money in Guinea.</p>\n<p>I eat and eat and eat.</p>\n<p>I buy all of the toilet paper.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_35.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_36.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Doukie.</em></p>\n<p>JB wanted <em>another</em> detour...</p>\n<p>Remote. <em>Again.</em></p>\n<p>We land at the 'hotel' JB was chasing.</p>\n<p>A hotel with a bucket and cup 'shower'.</p>\n<p>A hotel with squat toilets to crap in.</p>\n<p>A hotel that charges twenty five euros a night. That’s almost forty bucks... For this part of the world it’s nothing short of outrageous. <em>Who charges euros??</em> It has to be a stitch up. I <em>hate</em> being stitched up.</p>\n<p>JB promises me it’ll be worth it; he’s read something somewhere and reckons it’ll be a go-er.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm out of options anyway; there’s nothing around for hours and hours, it’s pretty late in the day already, and we got pretty lost on the way out here...</p>\n<p>I begrudgingly unload the bike.</p>\n<p>We’ve made it to Doukie just in time to fit in an afternoon hike. Our fearless leader, hotelier and hiking guide is an overflowingly talkative old midget named Hassan.</p>\n<p>He's so bloody energetic, <em>he must be on something...</em></p>\n<p>His English is solid – a massive plus.</p>\n<p>He tells us we should go on the 'Indiana Jones' hike. He's positively <em>busting</em>.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why do you call it the Indiana Jones hike?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;You will see!!&quot;</em> he gives us a big, gap-toothed grin.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm not going to argue. We head down a dusty beaten path surrounded by scratchy dry scrub and bushes that are giving my calves a severe exfoliation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_37.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not far down the trail we steeply descend down through gaps in massive, smooth, cool, grey rocks. Rocks the size of buses propped up on their arses.</p>\n<p>There are trees growing in places that no one told them it was impossible to grow. Random cracks and crevices in the rock walls are home to oversized trees - <em>just</em> clinging on - whose roots hang down to us on the floor below like thick vines. Some of the trees look like they’re just <em>floating in mid-air.</em></p>\n<p>With the massive, tall rock walls all around and the trees reaching for every bit of sunlight in the canopy above us, there’s not a whole lot of sunlight left for us down below and the atmosphere is heavy and cool and damp.</p>\n<p><em>It feels like we’re in a secret.</em></p>\n<p>We speak in hushed tones...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_38.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For hours we hike about in the hidden places.</p>\n<p>Streams of water come and go under dark and mysterious caves.</p>\n<p>The labyrinth just keeps going and going and going...</p>\n<p>Sometimes the rock faces open right up like a grand cathedral, and other times you have to suck in your gut to squeeze through the narrow gaps.</p>\n<p>Forty bucks is nothing.</p>\n<p><em>This is priceless.</em></p>\n<p>I’m like a kid at Christmas, champing at the bit to run off on my own and soak in the dark beauty of it all by myself.</p>\n<p>But we’re out of time; the sun has given up on us.</p>\n<p>We climb out into the real world as suddenly as we'd descended in.</p>\n<p><em>The sky feels too big.</em></p>\n<p>Back at the 'hotel' there’s a massive pot of pumpkin and peanut curry and rice waiting just for us.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the most delicious things I’ve ever eaten.</p>\n<p>I hoover four heaped bowls of it, go for a fifth, and realise that if I do I'm probably going to break something.</p>\n<p>After a bucket shower in the pitch dark I slide into clean sheets.</p>\n<p>I <em>do</em> feel like a kid at Christmas.</p>\n<p><em>This is going to be awesome.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I wake up to some honey on bread and a thermos of Nescafe.</p>\n<p><em>That’ll do just fine.</em></p>\n<p>Hassan wants to know if I'm ready for the 'K.A.H.'?</p>\n<p>&quot;What’s that?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The <em>'Kick Ass Hike'!!</em>&quot; he wets himself laughing.</p>\n<p>Fearless leader duties for today have been tossed over to 'cousin Mohammed'.</p>\n<p>Cousin Mohammad doesn’t talk very much...</p>\n<p>It’s already hot - the sun is only just getting started - but Cuz Mo, I shit you not, is wearing jeans, a jumper <em>and a beanie.</em></p>\n<p>It’s weird, but it's also not uncommon. In fact, it’s weird and it’s <em>extremely</em> common. For reasons I don't understand it's very popular in Africa to wear all of the clothes you own, regardless of how filthy hot it is. How they survive it, I'll never know.</p>\n<p>We walk past 'Hyena rock', which should be called 'Pride Rock' (it's straight out of The Lion King), and then we walk past 'viagra rock', and take appropriately inappropriate pictures.</p>\n<p>While we’re dicking around, we hear a dog barking in the distance.</p>\n<p>&quot;Shhhh...&quot; Cuz Mo gets serious...</p>\n<p>The dog barks again, far off.</p>\n<p>“Gorilla!!”</p>\n<p><em>Gorilla!?</em></p>\n<p>Are you fucking serious?? <em>Holy shit!!</em></p>\n<p>We walk on in the direction of the barking.</p>\n<p>I can't fucking believe this...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Across the other side of the valley we spot a troupe of baboons, silhouetted against the morning sky.</p>\n<p>&quot;Gorilla!!&quot; Cuz Mo points.</p>\n<p>I think he's disappointed that we're disappointed.</p>\n<p><em>Bummer.</em></p>\n<p>Still, pretty cool to see baboons, and who knew they bark like dogs?</p>\n<p>We crack on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The ground just <em>disappears.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gone.</em></p>\n<p>Over the edge of the precipice it just <em>drops</em> - an insane and nauseating distance - straight down to the savannah below.</p>\n<p>The cliff is so sudden and sharp that I can stand right on the very edge of it and feel the dizzy sickness of being scared shitless.</p>\n<p>No barriers out here...</p>\n<p>Looking to the side, the cliff, which seems to be leaning out, stretches away like an immense wall to a misty vanishing point. Looking ahead, I can just make out the paired cliff on the other side of the valley through the haze.</p>\n<p>Looking down, there are vultures and eagles, <em>tens of them,</em> playing in the updrafts beneath us.</p>\n<p><em>Beneath us!</em></p>\n<p>Bloody hell...</p>\n<p>Where the Dickens did all of this come from??</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_39.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Guinea’s showing off and there’s nowhere else I’d rather be... <em>No one gets to see this stuff.</em></p>\n<p>I'm already happy to call it a day.

Now crawling on our bellies like under barbed wire...</p>\n<p><em>Bugger this.</em></p>\n<p>What the fuck is Cuz Mo doing??</p>\n<p>Surrounded by dry, sharp, scratchy, thick shrub, I know for sure that this is <em>definitely</em> not part of the plan.</p>\n<p><em>It’s bloody hard work.</em> The sun is out and baking, and the humidity in the fog is heavy enough to make us pour with sweat.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Hours...</em></p>\n<p><em>We're never getting out.</em></p>\n<p>We're gonna die in here...</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>A stream.</em></p>\n<p>Mo seems pretty chuffed with himself, like a man who's just saved his own bacon.</p>\n<p><em>Thank fuck that's over.</em></p>\n<p>We take the chance to have lunch.</p>\n<p>Sitting on rocks in the middle of the stream we chow down on bread, and - of all things - some spaghetti.</p>\n<p>The air is thick with butterflies that don’t mind coming in to land on us. The water is full of tiny fish that go mental for any morsels of food thrown to them.</p>\n<p>Cuz Mo heads downstream a bit, strips off to nothing and gives himself and all his clothes a good wash.</p>\n<p>Turns out that under the jumper, jeans and beanie were another two shirts <em>and</em> a pair of long johns.</p>\n<p><em>Unbelievable.</em></p>\n<p>How is he not <em>dead??</em></p>\n<p>Standing there, naked, he’s giving <em>us</em> a confused look, like we’re missing a great chance to do some laundry.</p>\n<p>No thanks, Mo.</p>\n<p>It all seems quite idyllic, but the serenity is being ruined by swarms of little bastard insects. These fuckers are actually pretty cute; imagine a tiny little wasp, all black, about the size of a grain of rice. Doesn’t <em>sound</em> too cute, but they are. Tenacious little fuckers too; unlike flies they won’t go away at the swoosh of a hand. <em>They don’t give up so easily.</em></p>\n<p>And they have an <em>obsession</em> with eyes.</p>\n<p>The little fuckers make a beeline right at the corners, and stick the landing every, single, time.</p>\n<p>Deadly accurate. Makes me go berserk.</p>\n<p><em>Christ knows what they want to do in there.</em></p>\n<p>I can feel them squirming in my eyes, trying to dig their way under the lids.</p>\n<p>I can only guess it's an attempt to lay eggs in my eyeballs, or something equally horrendous. Take a shit in there. Or eat something.</p>\n<p>But once they're in there there's no deterring them. Takes a while to dig the bastards out.</p>\n<p>Unpleasant to say the least...</p>\n<p>They're tenacious, but they're not tough.</p>\n<p>Most of the time in digging them out I just smush them to death.</p>\n<p>Unpleasant. Messy.</p>\n<p>The only defence is to move. Continuously. Despite their accuracy, they’re useless when aiming at moving target. So it’s no problem, till you have to stop for lunch...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mo takes his time doing the laundry, and then puts all of his wet clothes back on again.</p>\n<p>Up the stream and back to the cliff face.</p>\n<p>Dogs barking again. I <em>still</em> can't tell if it's baboons or some wild dog...</p>\n<p>“Baboons!”, says Cuz Mo.</p>\n<p>Wait... I thought baboons were 'gorilla'??</p>\n<p>They sound <em>much</em> closer.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen enough wildlife doco's to know that baboons are mean bastards, with big fuck off teeth.</p>\n<p>I grab the biggest stick I can find and keep walking.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We eventually spot them, jumping through the trees.</p>\n<p>Chimpanzees...</p>\n<p>Or monkeys? I don't know the difference...</p>\n<p>If baboons are 'gorilla' and chimpanzees are 'baboon', I wonder what 'chimpanzee' means?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What goes down must go back up, it seems. There’s a narrow cleft in the cliff where the stream has slowly chewed its path through for god-knows-how-long. It being the dry season there’s hardly any water at all.</p>\n<p>Where the rock face is too steep to deal with without a grappling hook and a pickaxe, the locals have built 'ladders'. These ladders aren’t really ladders at all, but more like a bunch of skinny bamboo-like branches tied into stacks with vines.</p>\n<p><em>That’s it.</em></p>\n<p>As big as goal posts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_42.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's no cross bars to step on either, so you just have to stick your foot in the vines tying the stack together, and hope they hold.</p>\n<p><em>Pretty fucking dodgy.</em></p>\n<p>We climb and climb and climb, up through the waterfalls, all the way up to the top of the cliff again.</p>\n<p>It's a flat walk back to the camp, through small herds of cows with ringworm.</p>\n<p>Door to door: Seven hours worth.</p>\n<p>Kick ass indeed.</p>\n<p><em>I love this shit.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I could do this forever and ever and ever and not get sick of it.</p>\n<p>I'm going to stay here as long as I can afford it.</p>\n<p>Which, actually, isn’t that long; after thinking we’d taken out enough money to last us for a whole month here in Guinea we’re already starting to get dried up from this 'hotel'. Twenty five euros a night will do that...</p>\n<p>The nearest access to cash is a days ride away. And, of course, these guys don’t do bank transfers. I ask Hassan the question anyway, and feel immediately stupid for it.</p>\n<p>So, we've gotta make hay while the sun shines.</p>\n<p>Hassan offers to take me on an afternoon hike to see Hyena Rock.</p>\n<p>&quot;We saw that this morning.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Not like this!!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>JB's knackered after the K.A.H. and taps out. I can't miss the chance, so we head off.</p>\n<p>The trek is a short one, yet even more exfoliating than the K.A.H. army crawl. My legs die a death of a thousand cuts.</p>\n<p><em>It’s worth the pain.</em></p>\n<p>We stand on the rim of what looks to me like a crater, hyena rock sitting there, right in the middle, as though it were the asteroid the size of a high-rise slamming into earth.</p>\n<p>The sun sets at our back.</p>\n<p>Hard to enjoy the view though; the tiny wasps are all over us in thick swarms. I’m digging them out of my eyes again. Hassan tells me that that’s the <em>worst</em> thing that I can do.</p>\n<p>&quot;Really??&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, yes, if you <em>don't</em> touch them, they’ll fly away by themselves.&quot;</p>\n<p>Alright, I’ll give that a go...</p>\n<p>The next customer lands in the corner of my eye, and my eyelids go into <em>spasms.</em></p>\n<p>I'm <em>dying</em> to get it out.</p>\n<p>It’s digging and <em>squirming.</em></p>\n<p>I'm squeezing my eyes like I've got a twitch.</p>\n<p>My hand comes halfway to my face by reflex.</p>\n<p><em>I can't just leave it in there.</em></p>\n<p><em>It’s driving me crazy!</em></p>\n<p>It’s probably making babies in my eyeballs.</p>\n<p>Fuck this.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;How long Hassan??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>It's done doing what it came to do, and flies off.</p>\n<p>I feel a little violated...</p>\n<p>Another one comes flying right into the same spot, and gets immediately smushed by the angriest of fingers.</p>\n<p>Bugger that. <em>Kill them all!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_43.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>'Wet and wild'.</em></p>\n<p>We spend the day chasing rivers through the mountainous rocky scenery. Not nearly as spectacular as the K.A.H. or the Indiana Jones, but there’s lots of monkeys and chimps around, and not so many baboons, which is a plus.</p>\n<p>This time Hassan took us along, and, true to form, he was bursting at the seams with enthusiasm and chatter.</p>\n<p>JB's had quite enough of this hiking-all-day business and is itching to get back on the bike. He's seen enough...</p>\n<p>More than that; he’s out of money.</p>\n<p>So am I, actually.</p>\n<p>I’d like to stay a few more nights, <em>at least</em>, but if I stay tonight that’ll leave me with about 300,000 Guinean Francs, which sounds like a lot, but it's not.</p>\n<p>Only just short of 50 bucks.</p>\n<p>If I stayed tonight and tomorrow night I’d be left completely wiped out of cash, with no petrol in the bike and at least a days ride to anywhere that might have somewhere I can get more money.</p>\n<p>In short, I'm painting myself into a corner. It wouldn’t be the first time...</p>\n<p><em>But I have to do at least one more night.</em></p>\n<p>I’d regret it if I didn’t...</p>\n<p>JB can’t and won’t, and I won’t leave. Plus, it's too late to make a start on the bikes today...</p>\n<p><em>Not for JB.</em></p>\n<p>He kits up and peels off not long after lunch.</p>\n<p><em>Solo again...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I head off with Hassan for the afternoon hike. This guy’s energy knows no end. I don't know how he's doing it at his age.</p>\n<p>Off we go at a million miles an hour. He walks so fast I have to do a little skip every now and again to keep pace.</p>\n<p>We get to 'The Wall', but by a different route, and just hang out on the precarious cliff edge for a few hours, certain death just a short slide away, watching the vultures and eagles circle beneath us till the sun sets over a misty view.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty special, this Guinea place.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I come to...</p>\n<p><em>Pitch black.</em></p>\n<p>Where am I? <em>Where's the door??</em></p>\n<p>I need to shit.</p>\n<p><em>Now</em>.</p>\n<p>I'm lucky I haven't shat the bed...</p>\n<p>I feel around the walls. I still don't know where I am... All I know is that <em>this won't wait.</em> It's so dark I might as well have my eyes shut...</p>\n<p>I touch something familiar. I know where I am. I <em>fly</em> for the door.</p>\n<p>There's no time to grab the torch. I sprint to the outhouse squat toilet in the dark.</p>\n<p>It doesn't go well...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hassan's bouncing off non-existent walls with energy.</p>\n<p><em>I love this little guy.</em></p>\n<p>Last hike. No special names this time.</p>\n<p>Hassan takes me to a network of caves that somehow feel like we’re walking amongst the roots of a giant tree above us.</p>\n<p>We take a final trek to 'The Wall'. We hike down into what feels like it's guts. <em>Another secret.</em> There are more caves, this time underwater, I jump in and swim around. Icy cold waterfalls in the dark.</p>\n<p>The mouth of the cave is the face of the wall, and I can swim right up to the edge, and watch the water fall, sickeningly, off the edge and into thin air.</p>\n<p><em>I don’t want to leave.</em></p>\n<p>But I can't stay...</p>\n<p>I take full advantage of the free lunch and then pack up, and say goodbye.</p>\n<p>Hassan apologises that it wasn't very good, and tells me to come back again in the wet season, when it's <em>much</em> more spectacular.</p>\n<p>I do believe I'll do that, little man.</p>\n<p>I'd like to get to Conakry today, the capital, but I reckon that's going to be a bridge too far for an afternoon ride...</p>\n<p>A village named Kindia looks do-able...</p>\n<p>Off we go at a tear, down the orange dirt road.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The scenery is <em>stunning.</em> Too bad I can’t look at it; the road snakes its glorious, undulating way through the yellow and green mountains and cliff sides, yet as soon as I lift my gaze off the road to get a glimpse of the landscape I go smashing into some bloody pothole at a hell of a speed.</p>\n<p><em>The road is a shocker.</em> Corrugated like an asbestos fence and riddled with potholes.</p>\n<p>It requires one hundred percent of my attention. It’s a constant game of choosing the best path for the smoothest, fastest ride whilst avoiding those near invisible craters in the track.</p>\n<p>And it’s a bloody shame. I’m already regretting my hell-bent attitude. I feel like I'm rushing something that could be special. I wish there was a way I could have broken the ride up into pieces, taken my time, and enjoyed what could have been one of the most beautiful rides of the trip.</p>\n<p>But I can't do that. <em>I have no money.</em></p>\n<p>Head down, no rest breaks, crack on...</p>\n<p>It's another road that's not on the GPS, and looking like being another tortuous path...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's going to be <em>a lot</em> longer than I expected...</p>\n<p>About half way into the ride I get to a river, which is serviced by a little floating barge.</p>\n<p>While I wait for the barge to come over this side of the river I get to talking with a young lad, doing his laundry on the riverbank.</p>\n<p>“Comby-en lays urs ah Kindia?”</p>\n<p>&quot;Sank&quot;</p>\n<p><em>“Sank??!”</em> I was expecting more like three hours... <em>Max...</em></p>\n<p>I double check that nothing was lost in translation. And, yep, five hours. On my 'strong motorbike'.</p>\n<p><em>Shit!</em></p>\n<p>What's worse is that I know from experience that Africans are <em>never</em> conservative when it comes to estimations. If he says five hours it's probably more like six or seven...</p>\n<p>I shouldn’t have gone on that hike...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s getting twilightish.</p>\n<p>There's still a <em>long</em> way to go.</p>\n<p>Things are getting desperate...</p>\n<p>I haven't dared to take a break. My arse is killing me. My back is pinching <em>hard</em> between the shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>It’s obvious that I’m not making Kindia today. I’ll have to just take my medicine...</p>\n<p>I find a place marked 'hotel' in the smallest of villages. Despite its size, it looks like there'll be food and water somewhere. <em>That’s enough.</em> I’m exhausted. The last four days of hiking are compounding home <em>hard.</em></p>\n<p>The folks of the village go and rustle up the owner of the hotel.</p>\n<p>She undoes a big padlock that opens a gate into a courtyard.</p>\n<p>The place looks abandoned and derelict; it’s obvious no one's staying here...</p>\n<p>She undoes a padlock to a room. <em>My room.</em></p>\n<p>It's small, dark, dank and smells it.</p>\n<p>There’s a stained mattress on the floor with a dishevelled sheet on it. Like it's <em>just</em> been slept in.</p>\n<p>And that’s it...</p>\n<p><em>It's rank.</em></p>\n<p>I ask how much. Works out to be less than a dollar for the night; easily the cheapest place I have ever stayed in. Yet it still seems expensive...</p>\n<p>I’m weighing it up.</p>\n<p>Nope; this is <em>much</em> too far gone. <em>I can't...</em></p>\n<p>I jump back on the bike and <em>fly,</em> as fast as I dare in the fading light. I <em>have to</em> make the next village before dark. And they <em>must</em> have a hotel.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Light fades into darkness, into pitch.</em></p>\n<p>All I can see is what’s lit up in the cone of my headlight, and it's a shit headlight.</p>\n<p>The road has changed from uncomfortable and hard into scary soft sand, which is <em>far</em> worse.</p>\n<p>Time and time again I come to within inches of binning the bike.</p>\n<p><em>Shit day.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Kindia.</em></p>\n<p>I’m on the verge of throwing my toys in a tantrum.</p>\n<p>I'm not even happy I made it. We're a long way into the night, and I’ve got to find somewhere to stay...</p>\n<p>The good news is that the village is plenty big enough for cash machines and petrol and food.</p>\n<p>I'm waiting at a busy intersection, trying to decide the best direction, when two cops on a scooter pull up alongside me.</p>\n<p>&quot;Pap-ee-airs&quot;. <em>Papers.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fuck that.</em></p>\n<p>I’m nowhere near the mood for this shit right now.</p>\n<p>“Je ne comprend pas...”</p>\n<p>We go in a few circles, and I just keep saying I don't understand...</p>\n<p>They’re <em>not</em> getting my papers.</p>\n<p>We draw a crowd.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, I'm done, <em>I'm leaving.</em></p>\n<p>“Merci, au revoir!”. Thanks, bye! and I just ride off.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck 'em.</em></p>\n<p>They catch up and overtake me.</p>\n<p>They're not trying to stop me, but from the gesturing it looks like they want me to follow them. I think that they think that I'm obeying them. I think that they think they're escorting me to the police station.</p>\n<p>When they're both looking straight ahead I turn off down a random street, and they go straight on. I pin the throttle.</p>\n<p>Police: evaded.</p>\n<p><em>There's a first time for everything.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>What a pile of shit.</em></p>\n<p>30,000 francs a night, which is less than five bucks, which seems about right...</p>\n<p>It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but I get the feeling that this place is less of a hotel, and more of a brothel/place-to-fuck-in.</p>\n<p>I don't reckon many people actually do any <em>sleeping</em> here...</p>\n<p><em>I don’t care.</em></p>\n<p>I take a room on the proviso that I can park the motorbike inside.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Yep, pretty sure it was a brothel...</em></p>\n<p>Noisy humans and music kept me awake most of the night, as well as an especially tenacious and invisible mosquito who wouldn’t be denied...</p>\n","<p><em>Conakry.</em></p>\n<p>The first half of the ride to Conakry was a beauty.</p>\n<p><em>Tarmac.</em> I could’ve kissed it.</p>\n<p>It’s the first time in a long time that I’ve been able to switch the brain off on a ride and let it free wheel without worrying about the bloody bike ending up in a bush.</p>\n<p>Once inside the massive urban sprawl of Conakry the roads again turned to shit and the traffic turned into gridlock.</p>\n<p>There’s no such thing as 'lanes' here - there are cars randomly packed all over the road - so there’s no clear path for me and the bike to lane split down the middle.</p>\n<p><em>It’s ragingly hot.</em></p>\n<p>And I'm wearing all black everything...</p>\n<p>The sun feels almost <em>aggressive</em> as it beats down on me. There’s not a breath of wind. A million cars spewing hot black smoke. <em>Choking.</em> And I’m straddling a burning hot engine.</p>\n<p>I have to sit in the sweatbox for hours, rarely getting over walking pace.</p>\n<p>Absolutely fucked, I arrive in downtown Conakry. It’s a bit like Dakar, in that it’s a dirty great big city on the coast of the Atlantic with a hangover from French colonial influences. At least I know that the bakery will be on point; the French colonies all know their way around bread...</p>\n<p>There’s a Christian mission that I had lined up as the cheapest place to stay in town from some advice I'd picked up.</p>\n<p>160,000 francs a night. That’s twenty five bucks for some pretty basic accommodation. It's crazy pricey, but it's a clean bed. And it's not a brothel... I haggle my heart out, but they won’t budge; apparently they’re quite popular and I should be so lucky to even get a room...</p>\n<p>Ok. <em>Just for tonight...</em></p>\n<p>Clean sheets, a shower, and air conditioning.</p>\n<p>What a life...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>JB's got me covered.</p>\n<p>He's staying in a hotel - for free - through a contact he made in Bissau. I'm welcome to join him.</p>\n<p><em>Done.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s a hotel alright...</p>\n<p><em>Problem is that it hasn't been built yet.</em></p>\n<p>What JB has been doing is camping out on the first floor of a five floor hotel, where they only got so far as pouring the concrete.</p>\n<p>No doors, no toilets, no <em>nothing.</em></p>\n<p>Just concrete floors and a set of concrete stairs. A skeleton.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The 'contact' is the friend of a guy who JB met in Bissau. He squats here with his sister. Apparently, their father owns the hotel. I'm not sure I believe it...</p>\n<p>I hardly recognise myself anymore... that even <em>this</em> is still preferable to paying twenty five dollars a night for a hotel...</p>\n<p>I set up camp in a room on the top floor.</p>\n<p><em>The penthouse suite.</em></p>\n<p>I have spectacular views of downtown Conakry and the Atlantic Ocean, which is just a golf shot away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/oblivious/images/Image_45.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I’m given a bucket by our host and instructed to fill it up in the morning - which is the only time the communal water tap out the front will be dribbling out water.</p>\n<p>I’m instructed to shit wherever I like.</p>\n<p><em>Really??</em></p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>There's no toilet??</p>\n<p>No. Pick a room with a view and that’s your toilet.</p>\n<p>Doesn’t sound at all sustainable to me, but I’m not here for a long time...</p>\n<p>Someone, at some stage, is going to be in for a <em>big</em> surprise when they go into the east facing room on the fourth floor...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This tent is a <em>sauna.</em></p>\n<p>A bloody <em>sweatbox.</em> Not a breath of air through the tent’s mesh; the night is dead still and stifling, even outside the tent.</p>\n<p>But in here...</p>\n<p><em>I sweat and I sweat and I sweat...</em></p>\n<p>It’s impossible to sleep. There's no escaping it, <em>nothing</em> I can do. So <em>grimy</em>. Just greasy and grimy and generally <em>rank.</em></p>\n<p>In an act of claustrophobic desperation I open the mesh flap to try and invite <em>some</em> airflow in. <em>Anything</em>.</p>\n<p>After ten seconds I realise I'm being <em>eaten...</em></p>\n<p>I close the zip in a flash.</p>\n<p><em>Too late...</em></p>\n<p>I can hear them. <em>Lots of them.</em></p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>I turn on my headlamp.</p>\n<p>They're <em>everywhere.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>By the time I'm done with the extermination the tent walls look like a scene from out of Kill Bill...</p>\n<p>I lie down in a pool of my own sweat, and try to sleep.</p>\n<p><em>Bbbbzzzzzzzzzzzzztt...</em></p>\n<p>Fucking <em>bastard...</em></p>\n<p>I get up, locate the little mongrel mozzie - not easily, mind you - and kill it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm woken up once, twice, three times...</p>\n<p>By the fourth I'm going <em>insane...</em></p>\n<p>I'm so <em>itchy.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>As soon as the sun rises, I head - cap in hand - back to the Christian mission.</p>\n<p><em>Fully booked for the next week.</em></p>\n<p><em>Suboptimal...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The 'Consular' at the Sierra Leone Consulate is your stereotypical image of African bureaucracy; on the older side, with an oversized, badly fitting brown-grey suit with the arms cut off just above the elbows.</p>\n<p>Like a t-shirt suit...</p>\n<p><em>He look ridiculous.</em></p>\n<p>He's surrounded by paper in his shitty little office.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t want to give me a visa...</p>\n<p>I get the distinct feeling that this man just doesn’t like the look of my face.</p>\n<p>“Invitation letter... Where’s your letter of invitation? <em>Huh!?</em> You no get visa without invitation. No visa for you!”</p>\n<p>At least they speak English in Sierra Leone...</p>\n<p>I go find the nearest 'cyber', and forge a nice copy of a 'thank you for your booking' letter from a hotel in Sierra Leone. It counts as an 'invitation'.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly easy to do, and it looks legit.</p>\n<p>He won’t fact check it, I’m pretty sure.</p>\n<p><em>I hope not.</em></p>\n<p>I want that visa and I want it today.</p>\n<p>I head back to the Consulate and hand it to him. Smug.</p>\n<p>He still won't let me have a visa. Not till my interview.</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Interview?</em> What do I need an interview for??&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;To make sure you're not a Somalian terrorist...&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;What??&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Is he being serious? A <em>white</em> Somalian terrorist, with a British passport, trying to get to Sierra Leone from Guinea?</p>\n<p>This is <em>insane!</em></p>\n<p>But he won’t budge; <em>I need an interview.</em></p>\n<p>Not with him either, but with Sierra Leone’s diplomatic Ambassador to Guinea.</p>\n<p>Utterly, utterly insane.</p>\n<p>Not to mention a pain in the arse...</p>\n<p>He can't tell me when that'll be, either.</p>\n<p>What to do, then?</p>\n<p>I sit in the Consulate and read a book. He'll run out of patience with me before I run out of patience with him...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Friday.</p>\n<p>Saturday.</p>\n<p>Sunday.</p>\n<p>Monday.</p>\n<p>Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Thursday.</p>\n<p>Friday...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All day, every day, open to close.</p>\n<p><em>Nothing...</em></p>\n<p>I'm officially sick of this place.</p>\n<p>It's been a rough week.</p>\n<p>That fucking tent. Every night... Ugh.</p>\n<p>JB got the shits; knocked him out for a few days. I was telling him it was 'mild', and to get used to it - it's the first time he's been crook in Africa...</p>\n<p>In the middle of one of the nights, he thought he was dying. So he went to a local hospital.</p>\n<p>At 3am.</p>\n<p>A <em>huge</em> overreaction.</p>\n<p>They ran tests and told him he'd contracted malaria <em>and</em> typhoid... He medicated up to the eyeballs to stop himself from dying, then during the day went and got a second opinion from a Western hospital. They told him he had <em>neither</em> malaria, <em>nor</em> typhoid.</p>\n<p>I'm dubious of the whole thing, though JB's <em>convinced</em> he really did have both.</p>\n<p>I've been crook myself; who knew that eating a whole pineapple would give you the shits? I ate the thing like it was a chicken drumstick the size of my head. The next day I had to waddle like a goose to stop the brown puddle that I was making on the floor from touching my thongs. <em>Close call...</em></p>\n<p>In better news, I've perfected the art of showering from a single bucket of water. Trick is to scoop it up gently with two hands and lift it up like you're offering it to the gods, and letting it slide down your arm, rather than what I used to do, which is just throw it at myself...</p>\n<p>As for the visa, I've flip flopped from utter detachment to a sense of unwarranted entitlement.</p>\n<p>From 'Zen Master' to 'American'.</p>\n<p>In my more 'American' moments - demanding <em>something</em> be done - the Consular cracked the shits at me, “If I come to your country is this acceptable? Would I get a visa as easy as you ask for it? <em>Huh!?</em>”</p>\n<p>My reply was very nearly “but this is fucking <em>Africa!!</em>” but I held my tongue, after all, he had a point...</p>\n<p>I watch the sun set each night over the Atlantic, and the swarm of bats making their daily pilgrimage across the coast (yeah, <em>bats</em>). Sitting on my concrete slab, looking over it all, it’s not so bad.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Four books and sixty four hours later (seriously, four books, and I’m a one-word-at-a-time reader) I finally get my interview.</p>\n<p>I step into the Ambassador’s office.</p>\n<p>It's not just him and the Consular... As I shake hands, there's an Assistant, the Deputy Ambassador and a fucking army Colonel who's come along for the ride too.</p>\n<p>A <em>Colonel</em> for Christ sake!</p>\n<p>I know that that's a big deal; I've seen 'A Few Good Men' enough times to know that the bad guy's name is <em>Colonel</em> Nathan R. Jessup. <em>You can't handle the truth...!</em> Right? So what the Dickens could an army Colonel <em>possibly</em> want with interviewing me for a simple <em>tourist</em> visa?</p>\n<p>They're all dressed to the nines; the Colonel even has his fancy hat. <em>I look like a hobo.</em></p>\n<p>Despite the absurdity of it all I still can't help but feel the nerves; this is some <em>serious</em> brass and, what, with that forged accommodation letter and all that...</p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>I sit.</p>\n<p>It feels like a job interview crossed with some sort of bizarre interrogation.</p>\n<p>The Deputy Ambassador opens up, he noticed from my application that I'm from London... <em>He</em> used to live in London...</p>\n<p><em>Fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck.</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Do you know Primrose Hill?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>I’m not from London.</em> I’m from Australia. I used a mates London address as a bogus residence to get my bike’s rego papers. I’ve been using it as my address for any applications ever since, just to avoid inconsistencies. It's been working fine, till now...</p>\n<p>&quot;Ah, no... Which one is that again?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Primrose Hill, you don't know it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, uh, I haven’t been there before...&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm sweating, <em>profusely.</em></p>\n<p>The Deputy starts talking about the hill, then about London. He's not really talking to me, he's more showing off his worldliness to his bureaucratic buddies. I chip in where I can to back him up with whatever it is he says. Gives us both the appearance of legitimacy...</p>\n<p>The crisis passes, and we get down to it; why am I interested in Sierra Leone? What do I plan to do for money? Am I going to work in Sierra Leone? What am I doing for accommodation?</p>\n<p>They each take their turn to pose an inane, toothless question.</p>\n<p>It is - except for that brief pant shitting moment - a breeze. A waste of a week of waiting.</p>\n<p><em>I get the visa.</em></p>\n<p>It's just an ink stamp. <em>That's it...</em> The Consular has had it in his desk drawer the whole fucking time...</p>\n<p><em>Fucking protocol.</em></p>\n<p>The Consular, as he hands it to me, says &quot;the Ambassador appreciated your honesty.&quot; <em>I nearly laugh.</em></p>\n<p>I walk out without a word.</p>\n","<p>The Consular got the last laugh; he gave me one month on the visa, when I'd paid for three.</p>\n<p><em>Whatever.</em> I just want to move on...</p>\n<p>JB left the moment he felt confident enough to straddle a bike seat without something awful happening; he had picked up the visa for Sierra Leone already at another Embassy (without an interview...) and, like me, was keen to move on as soon as he could.</p>\n<p>I leave my hosts of the concrete paradise with a bottle of honey and a few hundred thousand francs.</p>\n<p>Before hitting up the border, I first needed to take out some cash; I'm dry. Again...</p>\n<p>It takes three goes at three different cash machines before I get the goods. I take out <em>bulk cash</em>, a hundred bucks worth. In Guinean Francs it's enough to choke a dozen donkeys...</p>\n<p>I know I’ll have to do an exchange at the Sierra Leone border this afternoon anyway, and I'll probably get my pants pulled down over the rate, <em>but I don’t give a shit</em>, I'm sick of running out of money...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s around midday, I’ve put some good miles of empty, potholed tarmac between me and Conakry.</p>\n<p>I spot a ways off in the distance a mob of cops on the side of the road, parked under a tree. I’ll 'buzz the tower' like I always do, and fly right by them if I can.</p>\n<p>Checkpoints, depending on the country, will sometimes have a little hut off to the side of the road, sometimes not. Sometimes they’ll have a barricade, sometimes spike strips, sometimes a rope tied between two trees, sometimes nothing. Sometimes they’ll have military goobers there, armed with big nasty looking guns, sometimes big sticks, sometimes nothing.</p>\n<p>Obviously you want to set your level of disobedience to whatever the checkpoint has on it.</p>\n<p><em>Horses for courses.</em> If there’s a barricade or a taut rope barring your way then you’re obviously not going anywhere. If there are big guns involved you might not want to do a fly-by unless you’re feeling lucky, <em>punk.</em> But if it’s just lazy cops kicking back in a hut on the side of the road, only blowing their whistles and waving their arms at you when it’s too late to stop you, it’s a safe bet that you’re in the clear; just wave back at them as though they were waving at you to say hi...</p>\n<p>I’ve been amazed at the number of times when, coming into a checkpoint with military goobers stopping traffic with a held rope, a crisp salute and not showing any signs of stopping has been returned with a standing to attention, a returned crisp salute, and a dropping of the rope.</p>\n<p>I always chuckle on the ride through, patting the tank of my very military looking Enfield as we ride off.</p>\n<p>This checkpoint has no barricades and so it’s ripe for a fly by.</p>\n<p>But, <em>I’ve been spotted...</em></p>\n<p>A young cop comes running out into the middle of the road, blowing his whistle and waving me down.</p>\n<p>I try to give him the salute treatment, but that gets no response. I pull in where he directs me and leave the bike chugging away in idle and flip my visor open.</p>\n<p>Always shake hands, always wish them a good day, always smile, always be a nice guy. Never give them anything more than what they ask for...</p>\n<p>The cop is a young guy - I’m guessing around my age - dressed in official kit, which is unusual. <em>He seems serious about his job.</em></p>\n<p>“Moto Pap-ee-airs.” <em>Motorbike papers.</em></p>\n<p>I give him the LP.</p>\n<p>“Passpor.”</p>\n<p>I give him the British Passport.</p>\n<p>Then, astonishingly, he asks for my immunisation certificate.</p>\n<p>“<em>Immunisation?</em> What?? Pour-qwa? Pour-qwa voos avey beswarn de sa?” <em>Why do you need that?</em></p>\n<p>“Parsk je swee la police,” <em>because I'm the police...</em></p>\n<p>What a prick. He’s obviously trying to be difficult, and knows his shit – I've never been asked for my immunisation certificate before, <em>ever,</em> which is good, because mine's bogus...</p>\n<p>I dig into my jacket pocket and find it in there somewhere. I hope he’s not going to read too much of it...</p>\n<p>He doesn’t.</p>\n<p>“Assurance.” <em>Insurance.</em></p>\n<p><em>For fuck sake.</em> I give him my motorbike insurance, which, again, is bogus; it's just a printed out slip of paper from my insurer back in the UK. It's does nothing for Africa, probably does nothing even in Europe...</p>\n<p>He's finally found what he’s been looking for; a chink in my armour.</p>\n<p>“Ce invalid! Oo eh le ECOWAS assurance?” <em>It's invalid! Where is the ECOWAS insurance?</em></p>\n<p>Got me. <em>I don't have that.</em></p>\n<p>ECOWAS is a grouping of West African countries, kind of like what the EU is to Europe. I’ve been told before that I’d need this special ECOWAS insurance, but till now I’ve gotten away with bluffing my way through with that bogus piece of very official looking paper...</p>\n<p>Roll that line out again...</p>\n<p>&quot;Nah, ce <em>valeed</em>. Regard: '<em>Aviva</em> Motorcycle Insurance', Sa ver di ker ce valid pour <em>too le monde...</em>&quot; <em>Look: Aviva Motorcycle Insurance</em> (Aviva's just the insurers name, nothing special, but he doesn't know that...) <em>that means it's valid for the whole world.</em></p>\n<p>He switches to English.</p>\n<p>“No! Not valid. Where is ECOWAS assurance!?”</p>\n<p>“Nah, it’s valid...”</p>\n<p>We go in circles again and again and again for a long time. I can feel my bike wanting to melt between my legs in this crazy heat from not having any air circulation.</p>\n<p>He has all of my papers - I'm not going anywhere without them - so the game now becomes getting them back...</p>\n<p>&quot;Show me my passport,&quot; He gives it back, reluctantly. &quot;See? Look at all the countries I’ve been to,&quot; I point out the visas &quot;Maroc – ECOWAS, Mauitanie – ECOWAS, Senegal – ECOWAS, La Gambie – ECOWAS, Guinea-Bissau – ECOWAS and all of Guinea, to now - <em>ECOWAS.</em> Now <em>you</em> - with all the border and checkpoint - <em>you</em> the only one - in all of this ECOWAS - who say this not valid! Hmmmm?&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm holding the passport, and, throwing some misdirection, I promptly and subtly pocket it; the queen of the chessboard - the most valuable piece, <em>mine again.</em></p>\n<p>I make another comparison, this time asking for the insurance, which I again pocket, and then the same again with the yellow card. <em>Pocketed.</em></p>\n<p><em>This is working well...</em></p>\n<p>By the time my mate's figured out what I'm doing, he’s only got my laissez-passer left, and he’s <em>not</em> happy about it.</p>\n<p>The argument escalates into raised voices and frustrated gesturing from both sides. I'm not giving him my papers back...</p>\n<p>“Ok, we go to police station now”, he says as he walks over to his motorbike.</p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>This is exactly what I don’t want to happen. Escalation is never good for me...</p>\n<p>I put my head back and look at the sky and give him an exasperated sigh, turn off my melting bike, kick out the stand, get off, pull of the helmet, and ask him if they have any water.</p>\n<p><em>It's like flicking a switch.</em></p>\n<p><em>Everyone</em> becomes crazy hospitable, and they fall over each other to get me a bottle of water. <em>Bizarre.</em></p>\n<p>I go sit under a tree for a while as the situation settles itself down. I watch as car after car rolls past without being stopped. <em>Unfair.</em></p>\n<p>I'm not sure why I've taken this tactic - seemed a weird thing to do in the heat of battle, to just go and sit under a tree - but oddly it seems to have worked in my favour; the overly tight situation looks like it’s starting to loosen up...</p>\n<p>The young cop has escalated the matter, passing it on to his boss; an old greying fat-man who’s kicking back in a comfy chair on the road-side.</p>\n<p>He’s equally unimpressed by my insurance papers.</p>\n<p>I roll out my explanation again, making a big song and dance about all the countries I’ve been to, all the borders I’ve crossed, all the checkpoints I’ve passed, and this is the first time “in <em>all of Africa</em> that I’ve <em>ever</em> been given trouble by <em>anyone</em>”, and about how “<em>everyone</em> I’ve met in <em>all</em> of Guinea - Koundara, Touba, Mali, Labe, Doukie, Kindia and Conakry – <em>everyone</em> has been so kind and welcoming. <em>Guinea is such a great country. I love it here.</em>”</p>\n<p>I've got him...</p>\n<p>I’m not sure if it's my confidence in myself, or shaming him as the only jerk in the entire country, but he suffers a crisis of confidence, gives me my LP back and tells me I can go.</p>\n<p><em>I could tap dance.</em></p>\n<p>Handshakes and magnanimous smiles all round.</p>\n<p>Gotta be happy with that. Totally and obviously in the wrong, I’ve still managed to get away with it.</p>\n<p>Stoked doesn’t begin to cover it.</p>\n<p>My shoddy paperwork has been a source of anxiety for me since day one; I dread getting in trouble for it. So to be found out like that, and be put under the blowtorch, and to be able to talk my way out of it anyway - it's <em>huge.</em></p>\n<p>It's like each country, each border crossing, each checkpoint is another feather in my cap. I must look like a fucking <em>peacock...</em></p>\n<p><em>No one can touch me...</em></p>\n<p>I toot my horn and give them a wave as I chug off to the Sierra Leone border.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Getting out of Guinea is a breeze.</p>\n<p>Pretty dingy border post. Passport tamponed with no questions asked. <em>Lovely.</em></p>\n<p>I bypass Customs - no one tells me I have to go there anyway.</p>\n<p>While I pick at a questionable lunch of mystery fish curry with rice, I chat with the officials and change a fat wad of Guinean Francs for a much smaller wad of Sierra Leonean 'Leones'. What a clever idea; lets name the currency after the country's name. That won’t be confusing at all...</p>\n<p>It's the first ever money exchange where there hasn’t been a need to haggle, the guy just comes straight in with a fair price which I take. I must admit it felt a little weird and I had the feeling like I’m somehow being stitched up anyway. <em>Who offers a fair price straight up?</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Sierra Leone border post looks organised and modern.</p>\n<p>A building made of bricks (very rare), which is way, <em>way</em> bigger than any border post has a right to be.</p>\n<p>The size is ominous; the odds are that the bureaucracy is going to be heavy and confusing. What’s stranger is that for a big and modern border it seems to be mostly empty. And because it’s a remote-ish post, there’s nothing to be seen around it either...</p>\n<p>I roll up to the building, and sure as eggs, it’s not obvious where to go or who I need to see...</p>\n<p>A fixer picks up my hint of confusion immediately, like blood in the water, and starts tailing me.</p>\n<p>Inside the building it’s just a really long hallway, with no signage. No 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Police'. <em>Nothing.</em> Just <em>doors...</em></p>\n<p>The only saving grace is that we're speaking English again. It's <em>so</em> much easier. I haven’t been able to just freely speak in English to officials since The Gambia...</p>\n<p>I wake up a guy who’s sleeping behind a sheet of perspex, and ask him what he does. <em>Immigration.</em></p>\n<p>He doesn't ask any questions, stamps my passport.</p>\n<p><em>I'm in.</em></p>\n<p>I ask him where to go for Customs. <em>He doesn't even know...</em> I let him go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>I ask anyone I can about where to find Customs. I just keep getting passed around...</p>\n<p><em>How can they not know??</em></p>\n<p>As a last resort, I walk way down the road to an army tent that's guarding the boom gate out. At least I lose my tail...</p>\n<p><em>They</em> have the Temporary Import Permits...</p>\n<p>So that's the T.I.P., But they tell me that it's not valid until I go back to the building and find someone to give it a special stamp. They won't let me into the country without it...</p>\n<p>It's all ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Back at the main building I pick up my tail, again.</p>\n<p>While I'm trying to find the magic stamp I accidentally stumble into an “Interpol” office - whatever that is...</p>\n<p>They want to know <em>everything</em>. I want to tell them to fuck off.</p>\n<p>Once they're finally satisfied, I go wake up some other guy at his desk. He wants to see my immunisation certificate. Second bloody time today...</p>\n<p><em>I've had a gutful of this.</em></p>\n<p>He flips through it, puts it down and then narrows his eyes at me.</p>\n<p>&quot;I want a Coke.&quot;</p>\n<p>It takes me a second to realise what he’s driving at...</p>\n<p>&quot;That’s nice.&quot; I snatch my immunisation certificate off his desk and walk off.</p>\n<p>Nothing here is making any sense...</p>\n<p>I try to look confident, try to keep the impression I know what I’m doing...</p>\n<p>I've talked to what feels like everyone, and no one can give me a straight answer.</p>\n<p>I even ask a guy having lunch outside. He's sitting on a crate, in the raging sunshine, eating a sandwich.</p>\n<p>It's <em>him.</em></p>\n<p><em>He's the boss of Customs.</em></p>\n<p>He's pissed off that I've interrupted his lunch. <em>I don't give a fuck.</em></p>\n<p>I get his signature and one of his minions fetches a rubber stamp.</p>\n<p><em>Done.</em></p>\n<p>I kit up and roll out.</p>\n","<p><em>Sierra Leone.</em></p>\n<p>The light, cooling forests of Guinea have given way to vast expanses of cleared land.</p>\n<p>Palm oil plantations, as far as I can see.</p>\n<p>Without the cover of the forest the temperature goes from uncomfortably hot to boiling. <em>Baking.</em></p>\n<p>The sun smashes down with no mercy, no respite. The air has a thickness to it. A foggy smoke.</p>\n<p>It’s ugly. <em>Sad.</em></p>\n<p>I chew the miles on what these plantations have bought; the best quality tarmac I’ve encountered in Africa. <em>Bar none.</em></p>\n<p>So why am I shitting cinderblocks? Why am I freaking out a little?</p>\n<p>Sierra Leone...</p>\n<p><em>Blood Diamond.</em></p>\n<p>I've been reading too much...</p>\n<p>In the late 80’s and all of the 90’s, everyone wanted to be the boss out here.</p>\n<p>If you had enough guns and buddies, you could be.</p>\n<p>Being the boss is lucrative; Sierra Leone is <em>full</em> of diamonds. If you control the diamond fields you control the money, and if you control the money, you could buy more guns and buddies. Keep riding the gravy train.</p>\n<p><em>It made sense.</em></p>\n<p>Our old mate Liberia got all the civil wars kicked off. One of the military leaders knocked off the President and took power for himself. That quickly became fashionable, and started happening all over the place.</p>\n<p>Democracy was dead; whoever had the biggest guns won power and took the money.</p>\n<p>Rinse and repeat that for fifteen years.</p>\n<p><em>Fifteen years.</em></p>\n<p>And these weren’t your run-of-the-mill civil wars. This was different...</p>\n<p>Tribalism and 'black magic' combined together to make for some seriously fucked up shit.</p>\n<p>Like that cousin-sister-fucker I met back in The Gambia...</p>\n<p><em>Cannibals.</em></p>\n<p>Brutal executions in the street.</p>\n<p>Hacking limbs off, just for kicks.</p>\n<p><em>Rape.</em></p>\n<p>Atrocities; par-for-the-course.</p>\n<p>What the armies and militias lacked in training and discipline they made up for with gruesome cruelty.</p>\n<p>What they lacked in numbers they made up for by pumping kids with drugs, brainwashing them, and giving them a Kalashnikov to go lay waste to those very villages that they had lived in.</p>\n<p>It would take Western intervention - better late than never - to finally sort shit out; the Brits 'liberated' their ex-colony with a handful of soldiers, absolutely wiping the floor with the untrained militia...</p>\n<p>That was ten years ago.</p>\n<p>So yeah. I’m a little bit edgy...</p>\n<p><em>All those people are still here...</em></p>\n<p>What am <em>I</em> doing here??</p>\n<p>Sierra Leone. Liberia. <em>Nigeria.</em></p>\n<p>Coming right up...</p>\n<p>I keep reminding myself that it's all my choice...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s a pleasure to be back onto good quality tarmac again.</p>\n<p>It’s been a while. A <em>really</em> long while...</p>\n<p>Normally my mind is occupied with keeping the bike upright, but out here, on empty, perfect tarmac, it’s a different story.</p>\n<p>No distractions.</p>\n<p>For <em>hours.</em></p>\n<p>No conversation.</p>\n<p>No music.</p>\n<p>No movement.</p>\n<p>No <em>rectangles.</em></p>\n<p>Just sit...</p>\n<p>The road, the thumping of the bike, the handles in the hands, the feet on the pegs, the arse on the seat.</p>\n<p>Loud, colourful sensory-deprivation.</p>\n<p>A freewheeling mind, given its reins...</p>\n<p>99.9% of what goes on I'm not paying attention to, but every now and again I <em>catch</em> myself, mid-thought.</p>\n<p>And they've changed; my thoughts aren't what they used to be...</p>\n<p>Invariably, my mind used to either replay one line of a random song over and over and over again - ad infinitum - or throw up an old piece of junk memory that bears no relevance whatsoever to what is happening <em>now,</em> or, running over and over in my mind the “what ifs” of something really, <em>really</em> shit happening.</p>\n<p><em>Or all three at once...</em></p>\n<p>In short: <em>Junk.</em></p>\n<p>A hyper, chaotic, jumble of useless shit. Repeated.</p>\n<p>For hours... Without hardly realising it.</p>\n<p>24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>\n<p>None of it was conscious; that’s just where my thoughts decided to take themselves. A mind flat out busy with the random and irrelevant.</p>\n<p>But, somewhere along the line, the pattern <em>changed.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are no songs anymore...</em></p>\n<p>Just that change, while slight, feels profound.</p>\n<p>It's <em>quiet.</em></p>\n<p>Ever woke up in the morning and there’s <em>already</em> a song playing in your head?</p>\n<p>That music player - on a constant, never-ending loop, from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep - has switched itself off.</p>\n<p>Buggered if I know why...</p>\n<p>It’s been no conscious, deliberate effort on my behalf...</p>\n<p>The quiet has freed up space that my free-wheeling mind has filled with other stuff, and being 'bored' doesn’t seem so exhausting, or maddening anymore. It's just quieter...</p>\n<p>I <em>do</em> still get random memories floating back, and the 'what ifs' haven't gone away.</p>\n<p>That makes sense. I get it. I get that my brain is just doing its level best to fix problems before they’ve happened. But it’s a headfuck. It doesn’t help me any. <em>Solves nothing.</em></p>\n<p>I try my best to catch it, the 'what if', and look at whatever the hell it is in the cold light of more rational thought, and realise that, whether I worry about it or not, it makes no bloody difference...</p>\n<p>Don’t let things be a problem until they’re a problem. Otherwise I’ll slowly drive myself insane.</p>\n<p>Parking that, I actually find myself spending more of my time thinking <em>consciously,</em> rather than unconsciously. The thoughts, rather than whizzing around unnoticed in the background, have come to the front where I can see them.</p>\n<p>I’m realising that a thought noticed is a thought I can <em>steer.</em> More by persuasion and suggestion rather than by actually grabbing the handlebars and taking it where I want to go. Like the art of riding in the soft sand...</p>\n<p>I’m digging, and I'm coming up with treasures, and truths.</p>\n<p><em>My</em> treasures. <em>My</em> truths.</p>\n<p>What are they? I couldn’t say...</p>\n<p>In the same way that a dream feels so real when you’re in it, and the moment you wake up it vanishes completely; the good, the bad, the ugly; the garbage and the gold; the diamonds and the rough; all of it evaporates the moment I step off the bike.</p>\n<p>Like a dream, it's still in me, somewhere. <em>It happened.</em></p>\n<p>It seems important.</p>\n<p>My mind, when given it's reins, used to bolt.</p>\n<p>Now it stays still...</p>\n<p><em>And I don't dream of the office anymore...</em></p>\n"]}
