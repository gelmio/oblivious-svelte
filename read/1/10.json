{"chapter":"<p><em>Dinner time.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that, even if I'm careful, anything I stick in my mouth isn't even going to touch the sides on the way through...</p>\n<p>One drop of Moroccan water in one end is going to turn things into a fire hydrant out the other...</p>\n<p><em>Whoosh...</em></p>\n<p>Ben and I are walking the streets, and we come across my <em>exact</em> nightmare: A crusty, homeless looking vendor is selling <em>meat sandwiches</em> from a push cart. Like the Moroccan version of a hot-dog seller.</p>\n<p><em>Revolting.</em></p>\n<p>Fucking horrorshow. There’s raw meat, sitting there, in the open. Then there’s tomato, lettuce and olives - amongst other mystery fillings - that are <em>glistening</em> with water.</p>\n<p>Ben asks how much for a sandwich, gets a response, then asks for how much with <em>double meat...</em></p>\n<p><em>Zing!</em></p>\n<p><em>I piss myself.</em> I never knew he had a sense of humour!</p>\n<p>Everyone, Ben included, stops to stare at me...</p>\n<p>The walnutted little Moroccan says something to Ben in French. Ben nods his head and puts up one finger.</p>\n<p>The little old Moroccan man goes to work, fanning his hot coals and throwing the mystery meats onto the grill...</p>\n<p>Finally, I find the words: “Ben! <em>What the fuck??</em>”</p>\n<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Are you <em>suicidal??</em> You can’t eat that!&quot;</p>\n<p>His expression is a mirror of mine...</p>\n<p>“What's the problem?”</p>\n<p>If this is a joke it's quickly getting elaborate...</p>\n<p>“You are <em>not</em> going to eat that.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“You’ll fucking <em>die!</em>”</p>\n<p>“Come one mate, really? Look,&quot; He gestures at the meat &quot;he’s cooking it right there in front of us. This is as good as it gets...”</p>\n<p><em>Shit a brick.</em></p>\n<p>I'm not going to last here... Not if this is 'as good as it gets'. How could it <em>possibly</em> get worse??</p>\n<p><em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>Shit, shit, shit...</p>\n<p>I give the human walnut a peace sign. <em>Two, thanks...</em></p>\n<p>Explosive diarrhoea, here I come.</p>\n<p>The nut asks a question. I look at Ben.</p>\n<p>&quot;Double meat?&quot;</p>\n<p>Ugh. &quot;Wee. Yes...&quot; In for a penny in for a pound. Right?</p>\n<p>We watch as the chef finishes up with the double meat, and goes heavy on the fillings into a baguette. The sandwich is <em>enormous...</em></p>\n<p>It's hot. Actually smells alright...</p>\n<p>I want to eat it back at the hostel, preferably already sitting on the toilet...</p>\n<p>But Ben's having none of it, apparently that wouldn't be right. Bad manners, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Well, <em>when in Rome…</em></p>\n<p>I wait for Ben to take the first bite - a part of me <em>still</em> thinks he's taking the piss - but he doesn't hesitate, and tucks right in...</p>\n<p>So I take a bite too.</p>\n<p>It's <em>delicious</em>. A delicious fucking <em>time-bomb</em>.</p>\n<p>I scoff it all and then double-time it the fifteen minute walk back to the hostel.</p>\n<p>I make it without shitting my pants.</p>\n<p>A relief. But it's coming, I can <em>feel</em> it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We spend the night hanging out with a couple of other backpackers. I can't really focus on the conversation; every ounce of my mental energy is funnelled into feeling for the <em>slightest</em> movement from my bowels, and hearing every noise that's coming from outside in case someone's stealing or defiling my Enfield.</p>\n<p><em>I can't believe I have to leave it out on the street.</em></p>\n<p>Disaster's imminent. One way or the other. I can <em>feel</em> it.</p>\n<p>The second time I head to the window to make sure there's no one there, Ben gives me disappointed look and a shake of the head.</p>\n<p><em>He looks a little angry.</em></p>\n<p>Five minutes later and I hear <em>another</em> noise. I have to get up to check, but Ben stops me dead.</p>\n<p>&quot;Get up one more time and I'll belt the shit out of you. <em>Stop</em> it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? I've gotta know!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, you don't. Let it go mate. You're not going to do this every-single-time. So stop. <em>Now.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>I acquiesce.</p>\n<p>I'm not gonna sleep well...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ok.</p>\n<p><em>Ben's the man.</em></p>\n<p>The Enfield is still there, my bowels are still intact.</p>\n<p>I've decided that Ben's going to be my guru.</p>\n<p>Mr Miyagi. Grasshopper.</p>\n<p>Yoda. Skywalker.</p>\n<p>It's gonna be the opposite of comfortable emulating this guy, but boundaries have to move...</p>\n<p><em>Give less of a shit. Be more reckless.</em></p>\n<p>Mum's gonna be stoked…</p>\n<p>We stroll through Tangier with a couple of girls from the hostel, Ben pipes up.</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you feel like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?? A child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you feel... like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Wearing shorts. Does it make you feel like a child?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ben. Explain yourself...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you see any <em>other</em> men wearing shorts?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Erm...&quot; I take a look around, &quot;No?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Noted...</em></p>\n","snippet":"*Dinner time.*\r\nI’ve got a sneaking suspicion that, even if I'm careful, anything I stick in my mouth isn't even going to touch the sides on the way through...\r","nextChapterExists":true}
