{"chapter":"<p><em>Just book the fucking ticket.</em></p>\n<p><em>The rest should take care of itself.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>My moment came when I was taking an ultra-extended, double-lunch-break from my job.</p>\n<p>No one will notice I'm gone. If they do they'll think I'm at a meeting...</p>\n<p>I’m out of the skyprison and walking through the Supreme Court Gardens. I never come here; it’s too far away from work. My feet have aimlessly dragged me out here anyway - with eyes glazed over. In fact, I’m not even sure that these <em>are</em> the Supreme Court gardens...</p>\n<p>Anyway. It’s a glorious day; there’s just the right amount of fluffy cloud in the sky, the grass is green, so too are the trees. The lake is blue. There are ducks. It’s all quite picturesque.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a thorn sitting in amongst the roses, standing out like dogs balls, crapping on my oil painting.</p>\n<p><em>A scruffy looking homeless lad on a park bench.</em></p>\n<p>He’s just chillin', taking the air.</p>\n<p>He’s got a big, fat backpack sitting beside him that looks like it’s had a hard life and is well and truly on the way out.</p>\n<p>He’s too <em>ragged</em> to be a traveller, but not quite <em>clapped-out</em> enough to be homeless...</p>\n<p>He’s an odd <em>goldilocks</em> between backpacking and hobo; like an intrepid destitute.</p>\n<p>Which is he? I can’t cog it...</p>\n<p>And it bugs me. <em>I need to know.</em></p>\n<p>I want to go and ask him, but I figure that in either case it’d be a little offensive.</p>\n<p>Plus, he seems to be quietly at peace, and I don’t want to kill his vibe...</p>\n<p>Then it hits me - right between the eyes - and makes my face scrunch up.</p>\n<p>Not the smell...</p>\n<p><em>A thought...</em></p>\n<p>Again, I can’t cog it... Here’s me, in my ironed shirt and fancy pants and shiny shoes, and over there is Marco Polo's arsehole. <em>And he’s having a better day than I am.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’m bloody sure of it.</em></p>\n<p>Just <em>look at him</em>... He's got two fifths of sweet-fuck-all, and I’m deadset certain that he’s enjoying himself, out here, in the sunshine, on his park bench, contemplating various duck oddities, more than I am, crunching numbers back at 'The Bad Place'...</p>\n<p>Then it hits me again, like a fucking freight train: <em>I’d swap places with the guy.</em></p>\n<p>I’d do it.</p>\n<p><em>I’d do it right now;</em> He can go back to 'The Dream Job', and I’ll hang out here and watch the ducks...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I pass the second half of the double-lunch-break on the park bench over from <em>Marco</em>. I've been trying to do what he does... Pretty simple.</p>\n<p>My hobo-cum-traveller decides to lie down and take an afternoon kip...</p>\n<p>So yeah, <em>he’s probably a hobo...</em> And I’m not sure I can take the copycat routine that far...</p>\n<p>But it doesn’t matter. The damage is done. <em>The seed is planted.</em></p>\n<p>I walk back to the chain-gang with a sense of purpose, and do something entirely irrational.</p>\n<p>Ticket: <em>booked</em>.</p>\n<p>Booked for an insane length of time into the future, but it's booked. <em>Done.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Blink.</em></p>\n<p>The 'insane length of time into the future' is <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p><em>It went that fast.</em></p>\n<p>I blinked, I nearly missed it...</p>\n<p>I've taken enough <em>jenga</em> pieces out of the tower of my life to bring the whole fucking thing crashing down. <em>A messy pile.</em></p>\n<p>But now I can start a new game...</p>\n<p>In the blink of an eye the girlfriend got dumped, the job got quit, the rent got canned, the car got cubed, freshly obsolete stuff got sold in a fire-sale, mildly sentimental stuff got dumped at my parent's place, a bag was packed, the bank was informed, drinks were drunk and <em>that was it.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Waiting in line to board the plane, the mad head-rush of excitement from the last few days washes off, and all that's left is the thought of how <em>easy</em> that was.</p>\n<p>Seriously, a cakewalk. It all just <em>dissolved</em>.</p>\n<p>Dissolved...</p>\n<p><em>Fuck...</em></p>\n<p>I’ve just dissolved my life...</p>\n<p>Shit...</p>\n<p><em>Shit!</em></p>\n<p>This is a mistake.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em> This is a <em>massive</em> mistake!</p>\n<p><em>What am I doing??!</em></p>\n<p>As I completely shit my pants, the lovely air hostess with the big smile and overly red lipstick takes my ticket and welcomes me aboard.</p>\n<p>I must look like I'm fucking <em>insane...</em></p>\n<p>But it’s all too late to undo...</p>\n<p>Even after the duck pondering it was already too late; there was no going back.</p>\n<p>The whole thing has dragged me along by my bootstraps to <em>seat 33A.</em></p>\n<p>Buckle your seatbelts...</p>\n<p><em>We’re fucking off.</em></p>\n","nextChapterExists":true}
