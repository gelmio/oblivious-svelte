{"chapter":"<p>Off to the Benin border.</p>\n<p>No visa, and no idea what’s going to happen...</p>\n<p>Time to roll the dice. I’m nervous.</p>\n<p>Togo is such a geographically skinny country that a street sign at a roundabout points to the right and says “Frontière Ghana” and points to the left and says “Frontière Benin”.</p>\n<p>Whichever way you turn, you end up in a different country.</p>\n<p>Left it is.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I get out of Togo easily enough. I ask anyone I come across about whether or not I can buy a Benin visa on <em>this</em> side of the post, so that I don’t get stuck in limbo between the countries if they reject me.</p>\n<p>“Non. Pas ici.” Okay, that’s expected, I guess..</p>\n<p>&quot;Eh la cotay Benin?&quot;</p>\n<p>“Non. Pas la aussi” What?? I <em>can't</em> get one on the other side either??</p>\n<p>&quot;Pour-qua?&quot;</p>\n<p>“Ce necessare d'allay a Lome.” <em>Everyone's</em> been saying that; I can't get it here, and I can't get it on the Benin side either; I have to go back to Lome...</p>\n<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>I <em>know</em> that there’s nothing that I can do back in Lome; they don't have a fucking embassy there...</p>\n<p>I’m gonna have to just suck it up and take my medicine...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm greeted with the Benin flag, and a cop. He stops me and demands my passport. He’s not gonna be happy that there’s no visa... Here we go...</p>\n<p><em>But no...</em></p>\n<p>He’s more interested in where I’ve <em>been</em>, fingering slowly through my passport, page by page, asking about the countries, always replying with - and I'll skip the French - “On this bike?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Aigh!?”</p>\n<p>“Yup”</p>\n<p>“This one?”</p>\n<p>“Uh huh. This one”</p>\n<p>He lands on a new page. “Nigeria!?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah”</p>\n<p>“On this?!” he points at the bike.</p>\n<p>“Yup.” He shakes his hand like he burnt his fingers.</p>\n<p>“You need a visa?”</p>\n<p>“Erm, yeah, yeah I do.”</p>\n<p>“Come.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's a fucking <em>breeze.</em></p>\n<p>Unbelievable.</p>\n<p>Transit visa, pasted and stamped. Which now gives me precisely forty eight hours to leave the country again. 10,000 CFA, which is about twenty bucks.</p>\n<p>Forty eight hours to Nigeria...</p>\n<p><em>I should be more careful what I wish for.</em></p>\n<p>The Douanes didn’t ask me for anything other than the bikes rego to write me up a laissez-passer.</p>\n<p><em>Love that.</em></p>\n<p>I skate away into Benin after a pretty well organised border, with 16,000CFA spent – about 33 bucks in all – with full papers.</p>\n<p>The whole damn thing was pretty quick and painless; most of the drama was happening between my ears...</p>\n<p>I think there’s a lesson in that somewhere...</p>\n","nextChapterExists":true}
