The Shrike is an epic, singular creature made out of metal spikes. It kills people for fun...</p> <p>It doesn’t <em>seem</em> apt as a name, <em>sure</em>, but I like it because it was the muse of one of the main characters in the book, and my Shrike is my metal muse; the inspiration for all of my best thoughts.</p> <p>I’m also not sure that it's apt, as the main character was - spoiler alert - killed (and brutally) by the Shrike in the book, but let’s not get too into the details...</p> <p>I just like it.</p> <p>Voilà; I told you it would be a short chapter.</p> <p>Today it's been a little hard to think; butterflies exploding in your eyes at 80 clicks can bump you out of your train of thought.</p> <p>The poor demented fuckers then get wedged somewhere in my helmet around my ears, and flap and squirm frantically like a fish out of water in their death throes. All of this happening <em>on</em> my face. I’ve gotta pull over, all the time, to get the bloody things out.</p> <p>I get stopped for the first time at a checkpoint. They're pretty toothless - despite wanting to see <em>everything</em>. They even accept my shitty, laminated photocopy of my drivers license.</p> <p>There’s the occasional eucalyptus tree lining the road. I didn’t know that they had those here. It makes me homesick.</p> <p>But hey, at least I haven't shat my pants yet.</p> <p>The sky is a gorgeous blue with fluffy white cumulus floating about, taking up about half the sky. Again, perfect riding conditions. Cameroon is just green, green, green and more green. It's so monotonous that when you pass a rare, red, flowering tree in bright full bloom it really hooks your eyes and leaves an impression.</p> <p>It tickles me when people are a couple of hundred metres up the road from me and they turn to look at where all the noise is coming from.</p> <p>The Shrike at 80 clicks heading uphill makes a hell of a racket!</p> <p>Fuckin <em>righteous!</em></p> <p>I’ve noticed that I fantasise a lot less about my desk job back home. It seems to get further and further away all the time...</p> <p>I work and I work and I hoard up all that money; and for what?</p> <p>To what <em>end?</em></p> <p>I reckon that the next time around I’ll work just as much as I need to make the ends meet, and then get to the ends themselves. The "Why".</p> <p>Do things.</p> <p>Learn shit.</p> <p>I've been having daydreams about surfing in the morning, in to work at ten, out at two, then heading to a class for language or music or going for a run or learning how to be a pilot or something like that. Different shit. A modern day fucking renaissance man.</p> <p>I've also had fantasies about not working at a desk job anymore, and being a labourer instead. The dream is to lift things. That’s all. Do an honest day’s work.</p> <p>I think the way I want to structure my life when I get back home is of physical and mental exhaustion, <em>every day</em>. Have the eyes roll into the back of my head even before it hits the pillow.</p> <p>That's what brings happiness and contentment, I reckon.</p> <p>An honest day's work and an honest day's learning.</p> <p>I think that when I was back home - pre-trip - I had the physical side down-pat. Logging big miles into my running shoes every day was making me sleep like a baby at night. But I neglected the other side - the mental side. Almost completely - in the four years I worked at the desk I don't think that I learned hardly any new practical skills or absorbed any real practical knowledge about <em>anything</em>.</p> <p>I ceased to be a student.</p> <p>I settled in to knowing what I needed to know in order to do my job, and no more.</p> <p>Not through lack of opportunity, but rather through a lack of gumption. Lack of curiosity. I didn’t give a shit for it. I tried - half-arsed - with music. I put too much faith in osmosis - the idea that if I put myself in the right environment, that I'll just "pick it up"; if I soak myself in something that it will sink in eventually.</p> <p>I've tried it with music, I've tried it with language.</p> <p>Osmosis doesn't do <em>shit</em>.</p> <p>Well, at least <em>I</em> don't work like that. <em>At all.</em></p> <p>We all need teachers; they give us direction and structure.</p> <p>When I return home, I want to have many different teachers for many different skills. As many as I can get my hands on.</p> <p>I want to be a jack of every trade.</p> <p>Learning awaits. It's exciting. I know I have the aptitude for anything I set myself to.</p> <p>My problem is discipline...</p> <p>"90% of success is showing up." Don't remember who said that, but it's true.</p> <p><em>I need to keep showing up.</em></p> <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-end justify-end mt-8"><a href=read/2/43 rel=prefetch class="p-2 no-underline rounded-lg bg-oblivious inline-block mr-4 text-lg">Next Chapter</a> </div></div> <div class="-mt-10 text-center text-xs">Oblivious | Luke Gelmi</div></article> </div></div></main></div> <nav class="flex items-center p-4 flex-row justify-between md:justify-start bg-oblivious relative z-0"><a href=/ ><img alt="Oblivious logo of motorbike in an outline of Africa" src=/images/logo-150.png></a> <ul class="ml-4 flex flex-col items-center md:flex-row"><li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=. class="p-2 no-underline svelte-ic3gzm">home</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=about rel=prefetch class="p-2 no-underline svelte-ic3gzm">about</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=help rel=prefetch class="p-2 no-underline svelte-ic3gzm">get help</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=mailto:obliviousthebook@protonmail.com rel=prefetch class="p-2 no-underline">get in touch</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78458726/77A44CD1/add_to_cart rel=nofollow class="p-2 no-underline">give</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=https://transactions.sendowl.com/packages/37218/89A60CC9/add_to_cart rel=nofollow class="p-2 no-underline">download</a></li> <li class="p-1 sm:p-4"><a href=read rel=prefetch class="p-2 no-underline svelte-ic3gzm bg-white md:p-4 rounded-lg" aria-current=page>read it now</a></ul> <span class="absolute left-0 transform bottom-0 mb-2 md:-translate-x-1/2 md:left-1/2 text-sm">© Luke Gelmi 2021</span> </nav></div> <script src=https://transactions.sendowl.com/assets/sendowl.js></script>
