I hate the special treatment.</p>\n<p>I make up for my embarrassment with the most effusive praise I can muster, really laying it on with a trowel.</p>\n<p>JB, meanwhile, hasn't been offered a full breakfast... He's busy eating some cereal that he bought the day before. The family seem <em>pissed</em> about that.</p>\n<p>There’s a tension here that I can’t really describe. Maybe it’s just me, but <em>I</em> feel tense. A weirdness. <em>There's something yucky about this...</em></p>\n<p>And I hate it. <em>Gotta get out.</em></p>\n<p>So, that’s the day's plan: <em>Find an alternative.</em></p>\n<p>Scoping out the potential accommodation options should take me on a walking tour of the whole city.</p>\n<p><em>That suits me just fine...</em></p>\n","nextChapterExists":true}
